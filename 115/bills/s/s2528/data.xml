This bill states that it is U.S. policy to: (1) condemn the government of Iran's violations of its citizens' human rights and freedoms of religion and speech, (2) support their fight for freedom and prosperity, and (3) work with international allies and partners to monitor and respond to protests in Iran in a manner that supports human rights and democratic aspirations and deters the Iranian government from committing acts of oppression against its citizens.

The Department of State shall: (1) work with social media companies to build an archive of social media communications to and from protesters in Iran, and (2) work with social media and telecommunications companies and Internet service providers to develop a strategy to prevent the Iranian government from shutting down Internet access and blocking social media access.</summary>
