  <summary date="2019-09-03T19:42:53Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Thailand Veteran Agent Orange Parity Act of 2018

The Department of Veterans Affairs may provide to any spina bifida-affected child of a veteran who served on active duty in Thailand beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, and who was exposed to a herbicide agent during such service, the same health care, vocational training and rehabilitation, and monetary allowance required to be paid to a similarly affected child of a Vietnam veteran. (The bill extends the presumption of service connection for certain diseases associated with herbicide exposure to such veterans, thus permitting health care benefits and disability compensation to be provided to their children.)</summary>
