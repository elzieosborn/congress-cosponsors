    "text": "Stopping Suspicious Orders of Opioids Act\n\nThis bill amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to modify enforcement authorities of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nCurrently, the DEA may deny, revoke, or suspend a registration for a CSA violation. It must first issue an order to show cause which, among other things, notifies an applicant or registrant of the opportunity to submit a corrective plan (CAP). This bill specifies that if the DEA does not approve a CAP, or if an applicant or registrant fails to implement a DEA-approved CAP within 30 days, then the DEA must: (1) reinstate administrative proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend the registration; and (2) immediately suspend the registration, in the case of a registrant.\n\n\n\n Additionally, the bill modifies the standard of review to immediately suspend a registration. Currently, the DEA may immediately suspend the registration of a controlled substances manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser to prevent imminent danger to the public health and safety. This bill lowers the standard for determining imminent danger to the public health and safety\u2014from substantial likelihood of an immediate threat to likelihood of a threat."
