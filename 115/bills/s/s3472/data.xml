This bill directs the Department of the Interior to convey to the Central Utah Water Conservancy District in Utah certain acquired lands, certain federal lands, and certain existing Big Sand Wash facilities.

The bill requires that specified actions must be taken by the District, the Moon Lake Water Users Association, Duchesne County, Utah, and the federal government before such conveyance is completed.

The bill grants the District the authority to prepay, at net present value, all irrigation block notices associated with the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project.

The bill shields the United States, after conveyance, from liability for damages arising out of any act, omission, or occurrence relating to the facilities, the acquired lands, and the federal lands, except for damages caused by acts of negligence committed by any U.S. employee or agent before the conveyance, consistent with the Federal Tort Claims Act.</summary>
