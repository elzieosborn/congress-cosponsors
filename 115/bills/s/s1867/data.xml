This bill repeals the expiration date of (thus making permanent) provisions of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 that require: (1) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to make available to the public a list of each major information technology investment made by a covered agency for information technology, including data on cost, schedule, and performance; (2) the Chief Information Officer of each covered agency and the program manager of the investment within the agency to conduct a risk management review of those investments that have received a high risk rating for four consecutive quarters; and (3) the implementation by OMB of a process to assist the covered agencies in reviewing their portfolio of information technology investments.

The bill amends such Act to extend the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative through FY2020.</summary>
