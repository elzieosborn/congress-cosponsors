A major rule is defined as one that is likely to cause an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in costs or prices, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, public health and safety, or the environment.\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) must provide guidance on, and oversight of, agencies' assessments of their proposed major rules.\n\nPilot Retrospective Review Commission Act of 2017\n\nThe bill establishes in the legislative branch a Pilot Regulatory Review Commission to evaluate and provide recommendations for modifying, consolidating, or repealing certain regulations that impact the transportation sector.\n\nPlain Writing Act for Regulations Act of 2017\n\nWhen issuing or revising regulations, executive agencies must use plain writing that is clear, concise, and well-organized if feasible.\n\nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs Transparency Act of 2017\n\nOIRA must ensure greater openness, accessibility, and accountability in the regulatory review process.\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis Improvement Act of 2017\n\nThe General Services Administration must contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to publish a study on the costs and benefits associated with major rules."
