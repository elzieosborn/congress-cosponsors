Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act

This bill instructs the Department of Energy (DOE) to permit its National Laboratories to use funds authorized to support technology transfer within DOE to carry out early stage and precommercial technology demonstration activities so as to remove technology barriers limiting private sector interest and to demonstrate potential commercial applications of any research and technologies arising from activities of the national laboratories.

DOE shall carry out its Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program, as announced on December 8, 2011, in accordance with this bill.

Department of Energy Research Coordination Act

DOE shall identify strategic opportunities for collaborative research and development of innovative science and technologies.

DOE shall carry out a program to enhance economic, environmental, and energy security by making awards for the establishment of Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct and support research and development of advanced energy technologies.

Department of Energy Office of Science Policy Act

The bill states that the mission of the Office of Science shall be the delivery of scientific discoveries, capabilities, and major scientific tools to transform the understanding of nature and to advance energy, economic, and national security.

 The Office of Science shall: (1) carry out specified research programs; (2) assess the potential for any fusion energy project supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E); (3) carry out a program for improving the safety, efficiency, and mission readiness of infrastructure at its laboratories; and (4) ensure the access of researchers to the most advanced accelerator facilities and research capabilities, including the Large Hadron Collider

DOE shall carry out Solar Fuels Research and Electricity Storage Research Initiatives.

The Office of Science may carry out a program for the production of isotopes that are needed for research, medical, industrial, or related purposes.

Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act

 By December 31, 2017, DOE shall determine mission need for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source to operate as a national user facility.

DOE shall: (1) carry out a program for enhancing the nation's capabilities to develop new reactor technologies through high-performance computation modeling and simulation techniques, and (2) submit budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development.</summary>
