This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require the Department of Education (ED) to move the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants under the Pell Grant program. ED must award the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants to each eligible veteran's dependent for assisting with the costs of attending colleges and universities. Students are eligible for an award if: (1) their parent or guardian died as a result of military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and (2) they are less than 24 years of age and enrolled at an institution at the time of the parent or guardian's death.

Pell Grant rules pertaining to the determination of financial need do not apply to the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants.</summary>
