This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a nonimmigrant renewable three-year visa (D-3 visa) for alien crewmembers employed on Hawaii-based longline fishing vessels.

The bill sets forth employer petition requirements and responsibilities, including requiring employers to enter into enforceable labor agreements with each approved D-3 alien prior to a fishing voyage.

The Coast Guard shall perform dockside examinations of ships employing D-3 aliens to ensure compliance with health and safety laws and regulations affecting seamen.</summary>
