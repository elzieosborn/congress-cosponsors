    "text": "Whistleblower Protection Coordination Act \n\n(Sec. 2) This bill permanently extends the requirement for inspectors general (IGs) to designate a Whistleblower Protection Ombudsman to educate agency employees about prohibitions on retaliation, and the rights and remedies against retaliation, for protected disclosures.\n\nThe bill renames the Whistleblower Protection Ombudsman as the Whistleblower Protection Coordinator. It also expands the responsibilities of a Whistleblower Protection Coordinator to include the following:\n\n educating employees about specific rights and remedies (e.g., the means by which an employee may seek review of an allegation of reprisal); assisting the IG in promoting the timely and appropriate handling and consideration of protected disclosures and allegations of reprisal; and assisting the IG in facilitating communication and coordination with other relevant persons and entities regarding timely and appropriate handling and consideration of protected disclosures, allegations of reprisal, and other general matters. A Whistleblower Protection Coordinator must have direct access to the IG to accomplish such responsibilities.\n\nThe bill also expands the responsibilities of the Council on the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to include the following:\n\n facilitating the work of the Whistleblower Protection Coordinators; and developing best practices for promoting the timely and appropriate handling and consideration of protected disclosures, allegations of reprisal, and other matters. Finally, the bill adds reporting requirements for semiannual reports. Specifically, with respect to instances of whistle-blower retaliation by an official, an Office of Inspector General must report on (1) the actual consequences imposed on the official who engaged in retaliation, and (2) whether a settlement agreement was entered with that official."
