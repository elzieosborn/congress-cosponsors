This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to expand the grant program for substance abuse treatment services for children and adolescents to cover young adults.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) must award grants for demonstration programs to: (1) expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders among adolescents and young adults, or (2) create and distribute resources on medication-assisted treatment training and implementation for health care providers of children, adolescents, and young adults.

AHRQ must report on the demonstration programs and the availability of medication-assisted treatment for adolescents and young adults. The report must include recommendations for ensuring such treatment is accessible.</summary>
