This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to expand the types of training that satisfy the training requirement to be a qualifying physician who may administer, dispense, or prescribe narcotic drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment in an office-based opioid treatment program.

Specifically, a physician who recently graduated from medical school (either allopathic or osteopathic) and successfully completed a comprehensive curriculum or residency that included training on treating and managing opiate-dependent patients satisfies the training requirement to be a qualifying physician.

The Department of Health and Human Services must establish a grant program to support the development of such curricula by medical schools and teaching hospitals.</summary>
