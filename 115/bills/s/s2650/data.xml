This bill adds to transportation law the definitions of "common carrier" and "personal operator."

 The Department of of Transportation shall issue or revise regulations to ensure that: (1) a person who holds a pilot certificate may communicate with the public, in any manner the person determines appropriate, to facilitate an aircraft flight for which the pilot and passengers share aircraft operating expenses and that such flight-sharing operations shall not be deemed a common carrier or a commercial operation requiring a commercial certificate; and (2) a personal operator shall not be subject to certain regulations relating to aeronautics and space.</summary>
