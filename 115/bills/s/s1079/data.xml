This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to revoke approval for an opioid drug for every new opioid drug approved. (Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as certain pain medications.) In determining the drug for which to revoke approval, the FDA must prioritize revoking approval for drugs that are not abuse deterrent and consider the public health impact of drugs on the market.</summary>
