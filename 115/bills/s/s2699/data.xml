This bill addresses voter registration&#160;of students who attend&#160;institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student aid programs, including by (1) requiring IHEs to make a good faith effort to distribute voter registration forms to each of their students at least twice a year, (2) authorizing grants to IHEs that greatly exceed the requirements governing the distribution of voter registration forms, and (3) allowing civil actions against IHEs that violate the requirements.</summary>
