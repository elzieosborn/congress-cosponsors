  <summary date="2018-10-25T19:53:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill modifies the self-certification requirements for federal employees who use disabled veteran leave.

Currently, a federal employee who uses disabled veteran leave must certify that the leave was used to undergo medical treatment for a service-connected disability. The Office of Personnel Management is authorized to prescribe the form and manner of such certification.

This bill adds a new provision to specify, in the case of a legislative branch employee, which office is authorized to prescribe the form and manner of the certification.</summary>
