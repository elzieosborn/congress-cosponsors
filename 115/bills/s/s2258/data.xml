The bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to discharge the liability on loans that parents received on behalf of a student who: (1) has become permanently and totally disabled, or (2) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or has lasted or is expected to last continuously for at least 60 months. Under current law, ED is required to discharge the loans to parents if the student dies.</summary>
