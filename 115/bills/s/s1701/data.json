The bill specifies exclusions.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report to Congress regarding (1) an analysis of the period between the date on which each paper becomes publicly available in a journal and the date on which the paper is in the online repository of the applicable federal agency, and (2) the effectiveness of the policy in providing the public with free online access to papers on research funded by each agency required to develop a policy."
