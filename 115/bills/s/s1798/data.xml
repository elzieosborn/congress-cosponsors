This bill directs executive agencies, including military departments, to reduce the risk of flood losses, minimize flood impacts, and restore and preserve natural floodplains. Agencies must also: (1) evaluate the effects of an action taking place in a floodplain, (2) ensure planning programs and budget requests incorporate flood hazard considerations, and (3) indicate their compliance with this bill to the Office of Management and Budget when making a request for a new authorization or appropriation. The bill sets forth characteristics to be used in determining whether an agency action impacts a floodplain. The Mitigation Framework Leadership Group must reassess annually the implementation of these requirements, and provide recommendations to the Water Resources Council.

An agency undertaking a federally funded project must comply with federal flood risk management standards, including construction guidelines, flood-proofing measures, and elevation techniques. Projects may be exempted if compliance would not be in the interest of national security, a project is in response to an emergency, or the standard is demonstrably inappropriate.

An agency facilitating a financial transaction in an area subject to a base flood (a base flood has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year) has a duty to inform any private party of the hazards.

Agencies must report on their compliance with this bill to the Council on Environmental Quality.</summary>
