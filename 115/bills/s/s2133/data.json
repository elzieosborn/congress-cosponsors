USDA may also provide technical and administrative assistance under the alternative funding arrangement.\n\nUSDA may enter into an arrangement if: (1) the goals and objectives of the applicable conservation program will be met by the arrangement, and (2) statutory limitations regarding contracts with individual producers will not be exceeded by any member of the entity."
