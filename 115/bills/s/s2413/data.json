(A bridge contract is generally an extension to an existing contract or a new short-term contract awarded to an incumbent contractor to avoid a lapse in service caused by a delay in awarding a follow-on contract.)\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for: (1) a common definition of bridge contracts, and (2) the appropriate use of such contracts.\n\nFederal agencies must develop policies and procedures that seek to minimize the use of bridge contracts."
