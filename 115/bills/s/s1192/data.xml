  <summary date="2017-08-18T17:41:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Veterans To Enhance Studies Through Accessibility Act of 2017 or the Veterans TEST Accessibility Act

This bill permits veterans to get reimbursed under the Post-9/11 educational assistance program for an approved licensing, certification, or national test at a pro-rated amount based on such test's actual cost. (Current law requires that veterans be charged a whole month of entitlement to pay for any such test.)

The bill provides that a national test that evaluates prior learning and knowledge and provides an opportunity for course credit at an institution of higher learning shall be eligible for such reimbursement.</summary>
