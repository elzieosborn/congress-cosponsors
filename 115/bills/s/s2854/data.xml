This bill establishes requirements for the use of an individual's driver's license or personal identification card by financial institutions to open an account or obtain a financial product or service. It allows financial institutions to scan or copy personal information and store or retain it in any electronic format.

Except as required to comply with federal bank secrecy laws, a financial institution may only use such information to: (1) verify the authenticity of the driver's license or personal identification card; (2) verify the identity of the individual; and (3) comply with a legal requirement to record, retain, or transmit the personal information in connection with opening an account or obtaining a financial product or service. After using the driver's license or personal information card for such purposes, the financial institution must permanently delete any image of the license or card within a reasonable amount of time.

The Department of the Treasury shall report to Congress on: (1) the decrease in the unbanked or underbanked populations through the use of the technology described in this bill in rural communities and underserved populations, and (2) the increase in violations of federal or state laws relating to the disclosure and security of personal information by a financial institution.</summary>
