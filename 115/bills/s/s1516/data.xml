  <summary date="2017-11-20T20:53:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to provide that the laws of a state designated by a health insurer (primary state) apply to individual health insurance coverage offered by that insurer in any state (secondary state) if the coverage, states, and insurer comply with the conditions of this bill. Insurers are exempted from any secondary state's laws that would prohibit or regulate the operation of the insurer in that state. The primary state is given sole jurisdiction to enforce its covered laws in any secondary state.

The Government Accountability Office must study the effect of this bill on specified health insurance issues.</summary>
