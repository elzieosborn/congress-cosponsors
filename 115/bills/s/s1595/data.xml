This bill imposes sanctions and reporting requirements with respect to activities associated with Hezbollah.

The President shall impose sanctions on (1) any foreign individual or entity that knowingly provides significant financial, material, or technological support for certain Hezbollah-affiliated groups; and (2) foreign individuals or entities engaged in fundraising or recruitment activities for Hezbollah.

The sanctions shall include blocking property transactions, barring of entry into the United States, and revoking granted visas.

The President shall also impose property-blocking sanctions on (1) any agent or foreign state instrumentality that has knowingly supported or participated in combat operations with Hezbollah or provided significant financial support, arms, or related materiel to Hezbollah; and (2) affiliated networks of Hezbollah, including those affiliated through the commission of significant transnational criminal activities.

The President may waive sanctions required under this bill if it is in the U.S. national interest to do so.

The President shall instruct the Secretary of State to increase efforts to strengthen the capacity of foreign governments to prevent hostile activity by Iran and disrupt Hezbollah's illicit activities. Such efforts include diplomatic efforts to persuade governments to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and to help governments develop legislation and financial investigative capacity.

The President is authorized to require financial institutions in the United States to establish enhanced due diligence policies in relation to correspondent or payable through accounts for foreign financial institutions.

The bill imposes and modifies various reporting requirements related to Hezbollah, including reports to Congress on (1) certain foreign financial institutions that process various transactions related to Hezbollah, (2) racketeering activities involving Hezbollah and its affiliates, (3) Hezbollah's fundraising and international operational capabilities and information such as which countries consent to such activities within their borders, (4) the estimated net worth of senior Hezbollah members and their sources of income, and (5) members of the Lebanese Parliament who identify as Hezbollah members and the significant conduct of such individuals.</summary>
