This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to work with federal agencies, states, and experts to develop and implement federal and state standards that protect individuals who are eligible for increased pension for a non-service-connected disability or death or for service on the basis of need for regular aid and attendance from dishonest, predatory, or otherwise unlawful practices.

The Government Accountability Office must: (1) report standards that would be effective in protecting such individuals if the VA fails to submit such standards as required, and (2) complete a study on standards implemented under this bill.</summary>
