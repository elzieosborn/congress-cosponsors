This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish organ transplant (including bone marrow transplant) care at eligible non-VA facilities to electing veterans who are enrolled in the VA medical care system and who received VA hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care within the 24-month period preceding such transplant care.

The VA shall enter into provider payment agreements with non-VA facilities for such care in each Veterans Integrated Service Network (regional VA health care administrative areas).

The VA shall not pay a veteran's travel and lodging costs outside the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network region in which the veteran resides unless the VA authorizes such outside care. (The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network is a public-private partnership that links all professionals and donors involved in the U.S. donation and transplantation system.)</summary>
