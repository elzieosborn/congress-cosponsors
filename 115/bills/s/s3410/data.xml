This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on large employers whose employees receive certain federal benefits during the year. A "large employer" is an employer who employed an average of at least 500 employees on business days during the preceding year.

The tax is equal to the benefits that the employees receive under:

 the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program), the school lunch and school breakfast programs administered under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, and Medicaid. The bill also prohibits large employers from asking questions or seeking information about whether a job applicant receives federal benefits.</summary>
