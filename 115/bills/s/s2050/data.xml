  <summary date="2018-05-04T21:35:42Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to require the Department of Agriculture to make payments under the Livestock Indemnity Program for livestock that is sold for a reduced sale price in excess of the normal mortality. Any payments made pursuant to this bill must be reduced by the amount that the producer received from the sale.

(Under current law, the Livestock Indemnity Program provides payments to eligible producers on farms that have incurred livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality due to adverse weather, or attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the federal government or protected by federal law.)</summary>
