  <summary date="2018-02-07T22:40:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 to require of detailed trial and defense counsel in a court-martial that there be adequate supervision and oversight to ensure effective prosecution and defense in the court-martial.

The military department concerned may assign the function of supervising and overseeing prosecution or defense in courts-martial by less experienced judge advocates to civilian employees of the department or the Department of Homeland Security, as applicable, who have extensive litigation experience.

The bill revises requirements concerning pilot programs on the professional development process for judge advocates to direct the military department concerned to assess the feasibility and advisability of a military justice career track for judge advocates under the department's jurisdiction.</summary>
