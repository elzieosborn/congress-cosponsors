This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the Department of Homeland Security to parole into the United States an alien veteran who: (1) is seeking temporary admission to receive health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and (2) is outside the United States after having been ordered removed or voluntarily departed from the United States.

Such parole shall not be available for an alien who is inadmissible due to a criminal conviction for a crime of violence, excluding a purely political offense, or a crime that endangers U.S. national security, for which the alien has served at least five years in prison.</summary>
