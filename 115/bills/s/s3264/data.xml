  <summary date="2019-08-21T17:09:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Knife Owners' Protection Act of 2018

This bill permits an individual to transport a knife between two places (i.e., states) where knife possession, carry, or transport is legal. A knife must be securely stored during transport, unless it is an emergency knife designed to cut seat belts.

It repeals provisions, commonly known as the Federal Switchblade Act, that prohibit: (1) the introduction into commerce, or transport or distribution in commerce, of switchblade knives; and (2) the possession, manufacture, sale, or importation of ballistic knives.

Finally, it amends the federal criminal code to eliminate two provisions&#8212;one that restricts the mailability of switchblade knives and one that restricts the mailability of ballistic knives.</summary>
