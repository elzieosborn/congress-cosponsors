This bill prohibits a dealer from selling or leasing a used passenger motor vehicle until a defect of the motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment or noncompliance with a federal motor vehicle safety standard has been remedied, except if: (1) the recall information regarding the vehicle was not available at the time of sale or lease nor on the manufacturer's website, or (2) notification of such defect or noncompliance is required, but enforcement of an order to notify of and remedy the defect or noncompliance is set aside in a civil action on a motion for change of venue.</summary>
