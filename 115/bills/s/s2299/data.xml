This bill amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Department of Agriculture to allow harvesting, grazing, or other commercial use of the forage on conservation reserve program lands when a governor declares a state of emergency.

The bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) to require the President, in evaluating a major disaster declaration request, to consider any impacts of the disaster that: (1) will impede the recovery efforts of affected individuals or the community; and (2) may not be addressed under disaster programs administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) but are addressed by other disaster programs.

The bill amends the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to require FEMA to include within the emergency management performance grants program grants supporting joint interagency cooperation between state agencies responsible for responding to wildfires.

Not later than 15 days after the President declares a major disaster under the Stafford Act, or after a state of emergency is declared by a governor, the appropriate federal banking agencies and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection shall issue guidance to depository institutions located in the disaster area for reducing regulatory burdens for borrowers and communities to facilitate recovery from the disaster.</summary>
