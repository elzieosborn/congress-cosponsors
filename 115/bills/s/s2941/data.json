    "text": "Strengthening the Cooperative Observer Program Act of 2018\n\nThis bill directs the National Weather Service (NWS) to make improvements to the Cooperative Observer Program, including by:\n\n furnishing support to state-coordinated programs relating to the program and states and regions where observations provided through the program are scarce; working with state weather service headquarters to increase participation in the program and to add stations in such states and regions; prioritizing the recruitment of new program volunteers; and ensuring that integrated reporting is available for qualitative observations that cannot be automated, such as snow observations and hazardous weather events so that they can be reported and uploaded quickly and easily. The NWS must coordinate with state and regional offices regarding the status of program stations at least every 180 days.\n\nThe NWS shall also coordinate with other federal agencies, including the Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Geological Survey, in leveraging opportunities to expand the program and to more effectively use its existing infrastructure, weather stations, and staff."
