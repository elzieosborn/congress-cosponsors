This bill allows the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to regulate the activities of common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio.

Under current law, common carriers are regulated exclusively by the Federal Communications Commission and are exempt from regulation by the FTC. The bill removes this exemption and subjects common carriers to FTC regulation.</summary>
