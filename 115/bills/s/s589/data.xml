This bill amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to revise the notification requirement for campaign contributions of $1,000 or more. The bill applies this requirement to any political committee, not just a candidate's principal campaign committee, regarding cumulative contributions (instead of single contributions) of $1,000 or more during a calendar year. Only the Federal Election Commission (FEC) must be notified, instead of the FEC and others.

Any amount transferred by a joint fundraising committee established by a candidate's authorized committee to any other authorized committee of that candidate shall be treated as a contribution.

Senate candidates must file designations, statements, and reports directly with the FEC instead of via the Senate.</summary>
