DHS shall not use such information to apprehend, detain, or deport:\n\n the child, a proposed or current custodian or sponsor, or a person living with the proposed or current custodian or sponsor. The Office of Refugee Settlement shall provide case management services for unaccompanied alien children after they have been released and facilitate efforts to connect the children with legal representation for immigration proceedings. \n\nThis bill also establishes the Office of Refugee Resettlement Advisory Committee on Shelters for Accompanied Alien Children. The advisory committee may conduct unannounced inspections of Office of Refugee Settlement shelters that hold unaccompanied alien children.
