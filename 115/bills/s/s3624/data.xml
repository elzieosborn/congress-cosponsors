This bill amends the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 regarding the treatment of minor aliens that enter the United States unaccompanied by a guardian.

When placing an unaccompanied alien child with a proposed custodian, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall not consider the proposed guardian's immigration status.

This bill also limits the use of information obtained for placing an unaccompanied alien child with a custodian, if such information was obtained from the child or the Department of Health and Human Services. DHS shall not use such information to apprehend, detain, or deport:

 the child, a proposed or current custodian or sponsor, or a person living with the proposed or current custodian or sponsor. The Office of Refugee Settlement shall provide case management services for unaccompanied alien children after they have been released and facilitate efforts to connect the children with legal representation for immigration proceedings. 

This bill also establishes the Office of Refugee Resettlement Advisory Committee on Shelters for Accompanied Alien Children. The advisory committee may conduct unannounced inspections of Office of Refugee Settlement shelters that hold unaccompanied alien children. The advisory committee shall issue a report on its investigations and recommendations regarding the shelters.</summary>
