This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide financial assistance to states for the development, implementation, review, and revision of a state energy security plan that assesses the state's existing circumstances and proposes methods to strengthen the ability of the state to have a reliable, secure, and resilient energy infrastructure.

A state energy security plan must contain specified content, including a risk assessment of energy infrastructure and cross-sector interdependencies, and address potential hazards to each energy sector or system, including physical threats and cybersecurity threats.</summary>
