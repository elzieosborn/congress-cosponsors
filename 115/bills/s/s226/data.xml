(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exclude from energy conservation standards for external power supplies any power supply circuit, driver, or device designed to power light-emitting diodes (commonly known as LEDs) or to power ceiling fans using direct current motors. The Department of Energy may prescribe new energy conservation standards for that equipment no earlier than one year after the date on which a test procedure has been prescribed.</summary>
