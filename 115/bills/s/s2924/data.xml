This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop guidance for states on ways to support family-focused residential treatment programs (substance use disorder treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women, as well as parents and guardians, which allow their children to remain with them during treatment). The guidance must include descriptions of funding opportunities under Medicaid and federal foster care and adoption assistance programs.</summary>
