This bill amends the Revised Statutes to prohibit any person, within 60 days before an election, from communicating, causing to be communicated, or producing for communication certain information on voting, if the person: (1) knows such information to be materially false, and (2) has the intent to impede or prevent another person from exercising the right to vote in an election.

The bill also prohibits false statements regarding public endorsements and hindering, interfering with, or preventing voting or registering to vote.

A private right of action for preventive relief is established for persons aggrieved by violations of these prohibitions.

Criminal penalties are also established for violations.

If the Department of Justice (DOJ) receives a credible report that materially false information has been or is being communicated in violation of these prohibitions, DOJ must communicate to the public accurate information designed to correct the materially false information.</summary>
