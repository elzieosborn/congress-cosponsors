This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to direct a consumer reporting agency experiencing a data breach to: (1) notify the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), other appropriate law enforcement agencies, and affected individuals; (2) provide affected individuals with free credit freezes and credit monitoring services; and (3) establish a consumer assistance unit.

The bill also establishes legal enforcement provisions concerning data breaches at consumer reporting agencies.

The CFPB may examine a consumer reporting agency to assess compliance with personal information protection laws.</summary>
