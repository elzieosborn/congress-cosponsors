This bill amends the Animal Health Protection Act to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to support state and tribal efforts in developing and implementing management strategies to address chronic wasting disease. The transmissible disease afflicts deer, elk, and moose populations.

In addition, USDA must make grants to research centers to support efforts to expand and accelerate applied research on the disease.

Land management agencies of the USDA and the Department of the Interior must work cooperatively with states in researching the disease and implementing state management strategies to reduce the spread and prevalence of the disease.</summary>
