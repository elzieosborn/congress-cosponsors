This bill makes changes to the process by which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) procures certain medical, surgical, dental or laboratory supplies for its medical centers. Specifically, the bill requires the VA to (1) award contracts to multiple regional prime vendors instead of a single nationwide prime vendor, and (2) prohibit a prime vendor from solely designing the formulary (list of medicines covered) for such supplies.

The VA shall ensure that VA employees who conduct formulary analyses or makes decisions about including items on the formulary have relevant medical expertise. Additionally, the VA shall provide Congress with periodic lists of such individuals and their medical expertise listed by categories of formulary items.</summary>
