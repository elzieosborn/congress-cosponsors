This bill limits an individual's civil liability for harm caused by the emergency administration of an opioid overdose reversal drug (e.g., naloxone) if the individual is one of the following:

 a licensed health care professional who prescribes or provides the drug to an individual who was educated on its administration; an employee or volunteer at an opioid overdose program who provides the drug, as part of such program, to an authorized recipient who administers it; or an individual who administers the drug after obtaining it from a health care professional or as part of an opioid overdose program, or administers it pursuant to a prescription, and was educated on its administration. This bill preempts an inconsistent state law that provides less protection from civil liability related to the administration of opioid overdose reversal drugs.</summary>
