This bill amends the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 to include railroad facilities among the critical infrastructure to be considered fixed site facilities for purposes of prohibiting or restricting the operation of an unmanned aircraft (i.e., a drone) in close proximity to such facilities. Other fixed site facilities may include military installations, oil refineries and chemical facilities, or amusement parks.

The Federal Aviation Administration must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking by March 31, 2019, for carrying out the the process for prohibiting or restricting the operation of drones near fixed site facilities, and then issue a final rule within 12 months after publishing the notice of proposed rulemaking.</summary>
