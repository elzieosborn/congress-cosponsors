This bill requires hospital care and medical services to be furnished to veterans, who were exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid, and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances while serving on military installations. Family members of veterans who resided at these military installations are also eligible for hospital care and medical services under this bill.

The bill also provides a presumption of service connection for veterans who were exposed to such substances. Under a presumption of service connection, specific conditions diagnosed in veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded.</summary>
