This bill amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to revise an exemption for Alaskan natives from a moratorium on taking and importing marine mammals and marine mammal products with respect to ivory from walruses, whales, or mammoths. Under current law, the term "take" means to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill a marine mammal.

States may not prohibit: (1) the importation, sale, transfer, trade, barter, or possession of ivory from walruses or whales if the ivory is legally produced by Alaskan natives as an authentic native article of handicrafts and clothing; or (2) the importation, sale, transfer, trade, or possession of mammoth ivory or mammoth ivory products.</summary>
