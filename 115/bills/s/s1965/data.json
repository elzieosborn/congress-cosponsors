Under current law, the term \"take\" means to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill a marine mammal.\n\nStates may not prohibit: (1) the importation, sale, transfer, trade, barter, or possession of ivory from walruses or whales if the ivory is legally produced by Alaskan natives as an authentic native article of handicrafts and clothing; or (2) the importation, sale, transfer, trade, or possession of mammoth ivory or mammoth ivory products."
