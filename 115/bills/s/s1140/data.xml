This bill repeals the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The CRA allows Congress to vote on a joint resolution of disapproval to overturn a recently issued agency rule and prohibit the agency from reissuing a rule that is substantially the same unless specifically authorized by Congress.

The bill allows agencies to reinstate rules overturned by the CRA by: (1) publishing the rule in the Federal Register within one year after enactment of this bill, or (2) using notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act after the one-year period after enactment of this bill.</summary>
