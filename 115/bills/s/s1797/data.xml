This bill requires state Medicaid programs to expand coverage&#160;for former foster care youth. Specifically,&#160;state Medicaid programs must cover individuals who were in foster care at 14 years of age but who subsequently left foster care due to a kinship guardianship. In addition,&#160;states must provide such coverage regardless of whether individuals were enrolled in Medicaid while in foster care.</summary>
