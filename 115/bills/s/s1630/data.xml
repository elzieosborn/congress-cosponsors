This bill establishes, within the Administration for Children and Families of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Interagency Working Group on Reducing Child Poverty. The primary goal of the working group shall be to develop a national plan&#160;for reducing to zero, within specified timeframes, the number of children living in poverty and extreme poverty in the United States.

The national plan devised by the working group shall also include recommendations for: (1) understanding the root causes of child poverty, (2) improving access to anti-poverty programs, (3) eliminating disparate rates of child poverty based on specified demographic factors, (4) improving access to quality jobs, (5) connecting low-income children and families to education and job training, and (6) shifting the measures and policies of federal anti-poverty programs toward the goal of helping individuals and families achieve long-term economic stability.

The bill also specifies additional duties, membership, and reporting requirements for the working group.</summary>
