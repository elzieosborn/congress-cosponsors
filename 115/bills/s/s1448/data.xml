This bill authorizes the President to require an independent regulatory agency to: (1) comply with regulatory analysis requirements applicable to other federal agencies, (2) provide the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs with an assessment of the costs and benefits of a proposed or final economically significant rule and an assessment of costs and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives to the rule, (3) publish the assessments with the rules, and (4) submit to the office for review any proposed or final economically significant rule.

An economically significant rule means a rule that is likely to: (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; or (2) adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities.

In addition, it prohibits judicial review of an independent regulatory agency's compliance with&#160;the requirements of this bill.</summary>
