This bill negates enforcement of a noncompete agreement that an applicant for a physician's position in the Veterans Health Administration has entered into with a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility, entity, or individual.

The bill requires a physician to have completed residency training prior to being appointed to a VA position but authorizes the VA to offer contingent appointments to physicians in training for up to two years prior to completion of such training.</summary>
