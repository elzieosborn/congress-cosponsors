This bill authorizes the President to: (1) provide hazard mitigation assistance in any area affected by a fire for which assistance was provided under fire management assistance provisions, regardless of whether or not a major disaster is declared; (2) waive the general prohibition on the duplication of benefits if specified conditions apply; and (3) enter into lease agreements with owners of multifamily rental property impacted by a major disaster.

Provisions with respect to the repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities are revised concerning large-in lieu contributions, eliminating the 90% and 75% federal shares for public and private nonprofit facilities.

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall develop and issue guidance for state, local, and tribal governments regarding the identification of evacuation routes.

 FEMA may: (1) establish one or more national veterinary emergency teams at accredited colleges of veterinary medicine; and (2) develop incentives and penalties that encourage state, tribal, or local governments to close out expenditures and activities on a timely basis related to disaster or emergency assistance.</summary>
