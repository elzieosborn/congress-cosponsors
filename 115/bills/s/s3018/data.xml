This bill&#160;repeals the alternative minimum tax exemption and the increased estate and gift tax exemption provided in 2017, uses the tax revenue to increase need-based federal student aid provided to students of institutions of higher education (IHEs), eliminates Pell Grant funding for institutions of higher education in states that do not maintain their funding levels for IHEs, and requires IHEs to disclose performance indicators (e.g., graduation rates and employments outcomes).</summary>
