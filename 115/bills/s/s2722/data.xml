This bill addresses pesticide and cosmetics regulation with respect to environmental justice concerns. Specifically, when developing policy and regulations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Environmental Protection Agency must:

 take federal and state agency and public comments into consideration, seek to achieve environmental justice, and ensure transparency regarding pesticide ingredients. The bill establishes Spanish-language translation requirements for pesticide labels, as well as for other appropriate languages.

The bill also establishes requirements relating to the safety of specified chemicals used in cosmetics, health and safety procedures in nail and hair salons, and related reports and grant programs.</summary>
