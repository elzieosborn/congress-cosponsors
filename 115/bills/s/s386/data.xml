This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to disclose details after payments are made from the Judgment Fund. (The Judgment Fund is a permanent and indefinite appropriation to pay judgments against the United States.)

Unless the disclosure is prohibited by law or a court order, Treasury must disclose to the public on a website:

 the agency or entity whose actions gave rise to the claim or judgment, the plaintiff or claimant, the counsel for the plaintiff or claimant, the amount paid, a description of the facts that gave rise to the claim, the agency that submitted the claim, and any information available on reports generated by the Judgment Fund Payment Search administered by Treasury. If the payment is made to a foreign state, Treasury must also disclose:

 the method of payment; the currency denomination used for the payment; and the name and location of each financial institution owned or controlled by a foreign state or an agent of a foreign state through which the payment passed, from which the payment was withdrawn, or that is holding the payment. No payments from the fund may be made to a state sponsor of terrorism.</summary>
