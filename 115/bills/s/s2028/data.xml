This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education (IHEs) participating in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program to assume some of the risk of default for student loans under the program.

 For any fiscal year in which at least 33% of the IHE's student body is participating in the Direct Loan program, the IHE must remit a risk-sharing payment that is based on the amount of its defaulted Direct Loans.</summary>
