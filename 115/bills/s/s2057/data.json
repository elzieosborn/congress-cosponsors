The position of pharmaceutical regulator refers to any officer or employee occupying a supervisory position within the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe bill also prohibits such a pharmaceutical regulator from participating in matters involving an individual or entity with whom the pharmaceutical regulator is negotiating\u00a0future employment.\n\nThe bill expands restrictions on lobbying by such pharmaceutical regulators following separation from employment with a pharmaceutical regulatory agency."
