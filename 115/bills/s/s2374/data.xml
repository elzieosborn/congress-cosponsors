This bill requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to pay to states their reasonable costs for compiling and sharing records of deaths with the SSA. Under current law, the SSA is not required to pay the states but may choose to do so.

The SSA may share the death data with federal and state agencies for various purposes. Such purposes include ensuring proper payments of benefits and tax administration duties.

The Office of Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of the Treasury shall develop plans to help federal and state agencies and Indian tribes use the death data.</summary>
