  <summary date="2017-10-18T18:44:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Viewer and Listener Protection Act of 2017

This bill establishes the Viewer and Listener Protection Fund through FY2022 to reimburse costs incurred by: (1)&#160;a&#160;multichannel video programming distributor (e.g. cable provider)&#160;in order to continue to carry the signal of a broadcast television licensee under specified conditions, and (2) a broadcast television station or broadcast radio station during the ongoing&#160;reorganization of&#160;the broadcast television spectrum.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#160;is directed to modify the transition periods for broadcast television stations that are changing channels or broadcast frequencies as part of the reorganization to ensure their broadcasting is not stopped for&#160;a significant amount of time. The FCC shall also make an effort to preserve the coverage area and population served by a broadcast radio station that is impacted by the ongoing broadcast frequency reorganization.</summary>
