This bill makes certain Department of Transportation (DOT) reports available online and eliminates specified DOT advisory councils and committees.

The bill terminates the Northeast Corridor Safety Committee once positive train control, an automated safety control, is fully implemented on the Northeast rail corridor. Additionally, the advisory board for the National Rail Cooperative Research Program is terminated effective January 1, 2019. The program is no longer receiving appropriations.

The bill requires the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), as parts of its grant request, to report on the status of efforts to improve safety and security along the Northeast Corridor.

The bill requires changes to charges and fees for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy to be posted online.

DOT must publish on its website the biennial report on how federal agencies are coordinating environmental review for transportation projects.

DOT must publish on its website the highway safety performance of each state. This requirement replaces the biennial report DOT was required to submit to Congress.

The Government Accountability Office must report on state highway safety programs.</summary>
