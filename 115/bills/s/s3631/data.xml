This bill revises the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation (TIFIA) program to: (1) require program applicants to obtain investment grade ratings from at least two credit rating agencies, unless the federal credit instrument is less than $150 million (currently, less than $75 million), in which case one rating will suffice; (2) require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement an expedited decision timeline for public agency borrowers seeking secured loans; and (3) require DOT to publish status reports on program applications on the TIFIA website.</summary>
