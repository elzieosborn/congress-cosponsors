 This bill requires the President to establish a National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy Joint Implementation Working Group to address the effects of extreme weather and climate change on fish, wildlife, and plants, including by adopting a national strategy and completing strategy implementation plans.

Federal agencies must integrate the elements of the national strategy that relate to conservation, management, and protection of fish, wildlife, and plants into their plans, environmental reviews, and programs.

The Department of the Interior must establish: (1) a National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to assess and develop scientific information, tools, strategies, and techniques to support interested parties in addressing the effects of extreme weather and climate change on fish, wildlife, and plants; and (2) an Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Sciences to advise the working group.

In order to be eligible to receive funds under this bill, a state must submit to Interior and the Department of Commerce a fish, wildlife, and plant adaptation plan detailing efforts to address the effects of climate change on fish, wildlife, and plants and coastal areas within the state's jurisdiction.</summary>
