This bill requires pre-separation counseling for members of the Armed Forces to include a description of Department of Veterans Affairs family caregiver assistance and support services, including information about covered veterans, eligible caregivers, and program assistance and support.

 Each military department shall take actions: (1) to determine whether each member of the Armed Forces who is undergoing pre-separation counseling and may require caregiver services has identified a caregiver; and (2) at the member's election, to permit such caregiver to participate in pre-separation counseling sessions in order to be informed of assistance and support services available to caregivers and the manner in which the member's transition to civilian life may affect the caregiver.</summary>
