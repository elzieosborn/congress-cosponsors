This bill expands the kinds of dental services and treatment that the Department of Veterans Affairs may provide to certain veterans, including veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, radiation, or other conditions. The VA must (1) carry out a pilot program to furnish dental services and treatments to all veterans; (2) construct or lease dental clinics in states that do not have VA facilities that offer onsite dental services, (3) carry out an education program to promote dental health for all veterans; and (4) expand the dental insurance pilot program by requiring private sector dental care providers to forward information on the care of their patients in the program for inclusion in the VA's medical records.</summary>
