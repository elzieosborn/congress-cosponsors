This bill establishes the San Rafael Swell Recreation Area in Utah. The Department of the Interior shall study nonmotorized recreation opportunities, including bicycle trails, within the recreation area.

The bill: (1) designates specified federal lands in Utah managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including the San Rafael Reef, as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System; (2) designates a 63-mile segment of Green River&#160;as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system; (3) allows the grazing of livestock, if already established, to continue in the newly established recreation area and wilderness areas; and (4) allows for commercial services necessary to fulfill recreational purposes.

Interior shall establish a trail plan that addresses hiking and equestrian trails in the wilderness areas.

In addition, with respect to other land in Utah,&#160;the bill provides for

 the management of the Goblin Valley State Park Expansion as a state park; the establishment of&#160;the Jurassic National Monument; the sale of public lands in Emery County which have been identified as suitable for disposal; public purpose conveyances&#160;of Emery City Recreation Area, the Huntington Airport, Emery County Sheriff's Office substation, and the Buckhorn Information Center; and the exchange of BLM and School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration lands in Utah.</summary>
