This bill provides financial assistance to workers harmed by retaliatory foreign tariffs by expanding the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers program. The program currently provides assistance to workers adversely affected by competing imported goods and services.

Under the bill, workers at firms that have seen a significant decrease in sales, production, or exports of goods or services, in whole or in part as a result of tariffs imposed by foreign countries in response to U.S. tariff increases, may petition the Department of Labor for trade adjustment assistance.</summary>
