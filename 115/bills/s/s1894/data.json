    "text": "This bill revises the coastwise laws, commonly known as the Jones Act, that govern domestic transportation of merchandise or passengers by vessels. The Jones Act requires that vessels transporting merchandise or passengers between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports be built in the United States, at least 75% owned by U.S. citizens, and mostly crewed by U.S. citizens. Jones Act requirements are currently waived with respect to vessels transporting passengers between Puerto Rico and U.S. ports. This bill permanently exempts vessels transporting merchandise between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports from those requirements."
