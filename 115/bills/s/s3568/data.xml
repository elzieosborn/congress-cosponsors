Specifically, these networks must (1) connect individuals with care providers, (2) identify successful maternal-care models, (3) facilitate collaboration among rural providers, (4) provide training and guidance, and (5) collaborate with academic institutions that have regional expertise.HRSA also must award five-year demonstration program grants to (1)&#160;train physicians, medical residents, and other practitioners to provide maternal and obstetric services in rural communities; and (2) support academic programs that&#160;develop or provide training&#160;to improve maternal care in rural areas.Further, the bill adds maternal-health services as part of the&#160;telehealth network and telehealth resource-centers grant programs.The bill also makes a series of changes to the research and reporting requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Government Accountability Office with respect to data&#160;on maternal-health outcomes.</summary>
