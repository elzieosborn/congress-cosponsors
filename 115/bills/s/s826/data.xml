This bill reauthorizes through FY2022 several programs that provide funding for wildlife conservation and sets forth requirements for invasive species management.

TITLE I--PARTNERS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION

(Sec. 1001) This bill reauthorizes through FY2022 the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program.

TITLE II--FISH AND WILDLIFE COORDINATION

(Sec. 2002) This bill amends the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act to direct federal agencies that have duties relating to invasive species management for the protection of water and wildlife to: (1) inhibit or reduce the populations of invasive species and effectuate restoration or reclamation efforts on land the agencies manage, and (2) develop a strategic plan for implementing an invasive species program designed to achieve a substantive annual net reduction of invasive species populations or infested acreage in managed areas. Under a strategic plan, agencies must prioritize the use of methods that control and manage invasive species in the least costly manner, are based on sound science, and minimize environmental impacts. Further, agencies must expedite projects and activities that are in areas at high risk for invasive species and require immediate action to address the risk.

The bill sets forth: (1) requirements for how agencies may use funds made available for invasive species management, and (2) reporting requirements.

TITLE III--WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

(Sec. 3001) This bill reauthorizes through FY2022 the African Elephant Conservation Act, the Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997, the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994, the Great Ape Conservation Fund, and the Marine Turtle Conservation Fund.

This bill amends the Great Ape Conservation Act of 2000, including to authorize the Department of the Interior to award a multi-year grant for carrying out a project that is an effective, long-term conservation strategy for great apes (defined in the Act as chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, orangutans, and gibbons) and their habitats.

This bill amends the Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2004 to make a wildlife management authority of a U.S. territory eligible for financial assistance for marine turtle conservation.

TITLE IV--PRIZE COMPETITIONS

(Sec. 4002) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must establish Theodore Roosevelt Genius Prizes for: (1) prevention of wildlife poaching and trafficking, (2) promotion of wildlife conservation, (3) management of invasive species, (4) protection of endangered species, and (5) nonlethal management of human-wildlife conflicts. The bill establishes advisory boards for those prizes.</summary>
