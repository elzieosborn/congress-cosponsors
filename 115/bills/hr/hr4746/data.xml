  <summary date="2019-08-06T22:36:54Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill revises the threshold for subjecting a&#160;bank holding company&#160;to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. Under current law, a bank holding company is subject to such standards and supervision if it has at least $50 billion in assets. Under the bill, a bank holding company shall be subject to such standards and supervision if (1) the company has at least $250 billion in assets; or (2) the company has between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council&#160;determines that material financial distress at the company could threaten the financial stability of the United States.</summary>
