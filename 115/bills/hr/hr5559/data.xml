This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to jointly prepare a report describing the process by which FEMA shall transfer to the USGS all functions related to the preparation of flood maps as required under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 that FEMA was previously responsible for performing. FEMA must transfer such functions by 18 months after enactment of this bill.

The bill changes the membership composition of the Technical Mapping Advisory Council.

The bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act to direct the USGS to charge policy holders a fee for the purpose of recovering the cost of mapping activities. FEMA shall deposit the fees collected into a Flood Insurance Risk Mapping Fund which shall be available to the USGS for mapping activities.</summary>
