The bill modifies the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness in Colorado to adjust the park's boundaries to exclude 1.5 acres of land identified as potential wilderness to non-wilderness.\n\nThe bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to permit nonmotorized access and use of the Bolts Ditch headgate and the Bolts Ditch within the Holy Cross Wilderness in Colorado for the diversion of water and use, maintenance, and repair of the ditch and headgate by the town of Minturn, Colorado.\n\nThe bill adjusts the boundary of the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado to incorporate 92.95 acres of land. USDA shall include all federal land within the boundary in the Bowen Gulch Protection Area."
