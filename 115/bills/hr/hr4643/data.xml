This bill amends federal transportation law to include among the duties and powers of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) related to aviation safety those related to transportation, packaging, marking, or description of hazardous material.

The FAA shall serve as the primary official representative of the United States on the Dangerous Goods Panel of the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 is amended to repeal provisions prohibiting the Department of Transportation from issuing or enforcing any regulation or other requirement regarding the transportation by aircraft of lithium metal or lithium ion cells or batteries.</summary>
