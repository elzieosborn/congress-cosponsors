This bill authorizes the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review: (1) the internal governance of the American National Red Cross (the corporation), and (2) any program or activity carried out by the corporation that is connected to national preparedness.

The bill grants the GAO: (1) access to, and the right to examine and copy, all records of the corporation that the GAO determines are relevant to such review; and (2) access to, and the right to interview, any employee, volunteer, agent, or member of the board of governors of the corporation whom the GAO believes has knowledge relevant to such review. The GAO may issue a subpoena and bring a civil action in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce such access.</summary>
