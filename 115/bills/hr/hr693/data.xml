 This bill amends the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 to exempt from its prohibition against lie detector use the employers of prospective employees who care for or supervise or interact with unsupervised children on a frequent basis.

 This bill requires such prospective employees to be given reasonable written notice of the date, time, and location of the polygraph test and of their right to consult with legal counsel or an employee representative before each phase of the test.</summary>
