 This bill amends the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) to revise the requirement that 10% of the award of contracts for federal-aid highway, federal public transportation, and highway safety research and development programs be set-aside for small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. This set-aside must include service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.</summary>
