This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) a Highly Automated Vehicle Information Sharing Advisory Council. The council shall undertake information gathering activities, develop technical advice, and present best practices or recommendations to DOT regarding the development of a framework to allow manufacturers of highly automated vehicles to share with each other and NHTSA relevant situational information related to any testing or deployment event on public streets resulting in damage to the vehicle or vehicle occupant and validation of such vehicles in a manner that does not risk public disclosure of such information or disclosure of confidential business information.

A "highly automated vehicle" is defined as a motor vehicle (excluding a commercial motor vehicle) equipped with an automated driving system.

An "automated driving system" is defined as the hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether such system is limited to a specific operational design domain.</summary>
