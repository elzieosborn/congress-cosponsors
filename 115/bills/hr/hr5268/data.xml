This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make grants to eligible local education agencies to provide improved security measures at schools and on school grounds.

Such grants shall be distributed directly to such agencies and used to improve security through one or more of the following:

 employment of additional school resource officers not already employed by the agency; entering into a contract or a memorandum of understanding with a local law enforcement agency, private entity, or nonprofit corporation for the services of school resource officers; increasing coordination with local law enforcement; and purchasing equipment, technology, or infrastructure improvements to control access to school campus, buildings, and classrooms, expedite notification of first responders, or stop weapons from entering a school building. In awarding grants, FEMA shall give preference to local education agencies that demonstrate that the grants will be used efficiently and effectively to secure school buildings or grounds.</summary>
