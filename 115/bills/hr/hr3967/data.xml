  <summary date="2019-08-12T20:55:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Trash Reduction and Sensible Handling Act of 2017 or the TRASH Act

This bill amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize state solid waste management plans to restrict the importation of out-of-state waste at the state and local level by requiring out-of-state waste to be from states with waste handling and reduction standards that are equivalent to or more stringent than the standards of the state receiving the waste.

Those plans may impose a community benefit fee on out-of-state waste, which may be higher than, or in addition to, the fees for in-state waste. States may provide those fees to affected communities and may differentiate community benefit fees based on whether the imported waste was disposed of at a landfill, an incinerator, a resource recovery facility, a waste-to-energy facility, or other waste handling facility.</summary>
