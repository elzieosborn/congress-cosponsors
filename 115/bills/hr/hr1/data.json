    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 13, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act \n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses.\n\nTITLE I--TAX REFORM FOR INDIVIDUALS\n\nSubtitle A--Simplification and Reform of Rates, Standard Deduction, and Exemptions\n\n(Sec. 1001) This section replaces the seven existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with four brackets (12%, 25%, 35%, and 39.6%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket.\n\nUnder the bill, most of the income that is currently included in the 10% and 15% brackets is taxed at 12%, and most of the income currently included in the 25% and 28% brackets is taxed at 25%. The bill also raises the threshold for income that is taxed at the 39.6% rate.\n\nThe bill imposes an additional tax on taxpayers with adjusted gross income that exceeds $1 million ($1.2 million for married taxpayers filing jointly) by phasing out the benefit of the 12% tax bracket, as measured against the 39.6% bracket.\n\nThe bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation.\n\n(Sec. 1002) This section increases the standard deduction to $24,400 for married individuals filing a joint return, to $18,300 for head-of-household filers, and to $12,200 for all other taxpayers. (Under current law, the standard deduction for 2017 is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses.)\n\n(Sec. 1003) This section: (1) repeals the deduction for personal exemptions (2) modifies the requirements that determine who is required to file a tax return, and (3) repeals the increased deduction for qualified disability trusts.\n\n(Sec. 1004) This section establishes a maximum 25% rate on the qualified business income of individuals (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates.)\n\nQualified business income is all net business income from a passive business activity plus the capital percentage of net business income from an active business activity, reduced by carryover business losses and by certain net business losses from the current year, as specified in the bill.\n\nThe bill provides a reduced tax rate for certain small businesses with net active business income below an indexed threshold of $75,000 for married individuals filing jointly. The amount taxed at the rate is reduced by the excess of taxable income over an indexed threshold of $150,000.\n\n(Sec. 1005) This section makes several conforming changes related to the modified individual tax rates.\n\nSubtitle B--Simplification and Reform of Family and Individual Tax Credits\n\n(Sec. 1101) This section increases the child tax credit and expands it to include a new family tax credit.\n\nThe bill allows credits of: $1,600 ($1,000 under current law) per qualifying child under the age of 17, and $300 for the taxpayer (both spouses in the case of married taxpayers filing a joint return) and each dependent of the taxpayer who is not a qualifying child under age 17.\n\nThe credits are phased out at adjusted gross income (AGI) levels of $230,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns and $115,000 for individuals.\n\nThe refundable portion of the credit is limited to $1,000 per qualifying child, adjusted for inflation after 2017. The $300 credit for the taxpayer, spouse, and non-child dependents of the taxpayer expires after 2022.\n\n(Sec. 1102) This section repeals the nonrefundable credits for: (1) taxpayers who are over 65 or retired on the account of permanent and total disability, (2) interest on certain home mortgages covered by a mortgage credit certificate issued by a qualified governmental unit, and (3) new plug-in electric drive motor vehicles.\n\n(Sec. 1103) This section modifies the taxpayer identification number requirements for the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit (EITC), and the American Opportunity tax credit.\n\n(Sec. 1104) This section specifies that a taxpayer must claim all allowable deductions when determining net earnings from self-employment for the purpose of the EITC.\n\nIt also modifies the requirements for employer reporting of wages to require employers to report, along with the aggregate wages paid and employment taxes collected, the name and address of each employee and the amount of reportable wages received by each of those employees.\n\n(Sec. 1105) This section limits earned income, for purposes of the EITC, to amounts substantiated by the taxpayer on statements furnished or returns filed under third party information reporting requirements or amounts substantiated by the taxpayer's books and records.\n\nSubtitle C--Simplification and Reform of Education Incentives\n\n(Sec. 1201) This section repeals the Lifetime Learning credit and modifies the American Opportunity credit, which, under current law, may both be used for qualified tuition and related expenses.\n\nThe modified American Opportunity credit may be claimed with respect to a student for five taxable years (four years under current law). For a credit claimed with respect to the student's fifth taxable year, the credit is half the value of the American Opportunity credit that is applicable to the first four taxable years. A student may claim the credit for any of the first five years of postsecondary education.\n\n(Sec. 1202) This section consolidates and modifies several provisions regarding education savings accounts to replace Coverdell savings accounts with modified rules for tax-exempt qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans).\n\nThe bill prohibits new contributions to Coverdell savings accounts after 2017. Rollovers from one Coverdell savings account to another are permitted after this date. 529 plans may receive rollovers from Coverdell savings accounts.\n\nThe bill modifies 529 plans to allow the plans to distribute up to $10,000 in expenses for tuition incurred during the taxable year in connection with the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at a public, private, or religious elementary or secondary school. The $10,000 limitation applies on a per-student basis for distributions from all 529 accounts.\n\nThe bill also modifies 529 plans to: (1) allow distributions to be used for certain expenses required for attendance in a registered apprenticeship program, and (2) specify that an unborn child may qualify as a designated beneficiary.\n\n(Sec. 1203) This section modifies the exclusion of student loan discharges from gross income, to include within the exclusion certain discharges on account of the death or total and permanent disability of the student.\n\nThe section also modifies the gross income exclusion for amounts received under the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program or certain state loan repayment programs to include any amount received by an individual under the Indian Health Service loan repayment program.\n\n(Sec. 1204) This section repeals several education-related deductions and exclusions, including:\n\n the deduction for interest on education loans, the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, the exclusion for income from U.S. savings bonds used to pay higher education tuition and fees, the exclusion for educational assistance programs, and the exclusion for qualified tuition reductions. (Sec. 1205) This section allows funds from 529 accounts to be rolled over to an ABLE account without penalty if the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of that 529 account, or a member of the designated beneficiary's family. (Tax-favored ABLE [Achieving a Better Life Experience] accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses.)\n\nSubtitle D--Simplification and Reform of Deductions\n\n(Sec. 1301) This section repeals the overall limitation on itemized deductions, which currently applies when AGI exceeds a specified amount.\n\n(Sec. 1302) This section modifies the deduction for home mortgage interest to: (1) limit the deduction to mortgages for a principal residence, (2) limit the deduction for debt incurred after November 2, 2017, to mortgages of up to $500,000 (currently $1 million), and (3) prohibit the deduction from being used for interest paid on home equity loans.\n\n(Sec. 1303) For individual taxpayers, this section prohibits the deductions for state, local, and foreign real property taxes; and state and local personal property taxes unless the taxes are paid or accrued in a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income.\n\nThe bill includes an exception that allows an individual to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes, in addition to taxes that may be deducted because they are paid or accrued in a trade or business or for expenses for the production of income.\n\nThe bill also repeals the deduction for state and local income, war profits, and excess profits taxes of individuals.\n\n(Sec. 1304) This section repeals the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses, with an exception for the deduction, as modified by the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, for individuals who sustained a personal casualty loss as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, or Maria.\n\n(Sec. 1305) This section modifies a provision that limits the deduction for wagering losses to the extent of the gains from such transactions. The bill specifies that \"losses from wagering transactions\" include otherwise deductible expenses incurred in carrying out a wagering transaction (e.g., expenses for traveling to or from a casino).\n\n(Sec. 1306) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to: (1) increase from 50% to 60% the income-based percentage limitations for contributions of cash to public charities, (2) prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights, (3) replace the statutory charitable mileage rate of 14 cents per mile with a rate that takes into account the variable cost of operating an automobile (adjusted for inflation), (4) repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization.\n\n(Sec. 1307) This section repeals the deduction for expenses paid or incurred in connection with determination, collection, or refund of any tax.\n\n(Sec. 1308) This section repeals the deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses.\n\n(Sec. 1309) This section repeals the deduction for alimony or separate maintenance payments from the payer spouse and the corresponding inclusion of the payments in the gross income of the recipient spouse.\n\n(Sec. 1310) This section repeals the deduction for moving expenses, with an exception for moving expense of members of the Armed Forces.\n\n(Sec. 1311) This section repeals the deductions and exclusions for contributions to Archer Medical Savings Accounts.\n\n(Sec. 1312) This section prohibits any deduction for expenses attributable to the trade or business of being an employee, except for expenses that are deductible from gross income (above-the-line deductions).\n\nThis section also repeals the above-the-line deductions for: (1) certain expenses of performing artists;
