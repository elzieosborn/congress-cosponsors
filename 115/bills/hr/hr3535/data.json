    "text": "Ruffey Rancheria Restoration Act of 2017\n\nThis bill restores federal recognition of the Ruffey Rancheria Tribe of California and federal rights and privileges of the Indian tribe and its members. It also makes the tribe and its members residing in the tribe's service area eligible for the federal services and benefits that are furnished to federally recognized Indian tribes and their members residing on a reservation.\n\nThe Department of the Interior may place up to 441 acres of property located in Siskiyou County, California, into a trust for the benefit of the tribe. The land may be used for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act if certain requirements are met.\n\nWithin a year of the bill's enactment, Interior must compile a membership roll of the tribe. The bill establishes criteria for enrolling members prior to the adoption of a tribal constitution.\n\nThe bill sets forth a process for establishing an interim governing body until a new tribal constitution and bylaws are adopted, ratifying the constitution, and electing tribal officials."
