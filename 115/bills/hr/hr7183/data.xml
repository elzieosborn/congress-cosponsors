This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to convene a working group on a regular basis with the Department of Labor, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Health and Human Service, the Small Business Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Commerce, and other appropriate agencies to:

 develop a report that identifies and describes the potential areas of duplication or fragmentation in post-disaster declarations in federal assessments of data collection methods and data collected and program delivery after post-disaster declarations; determine the applicability of having one federal agency make the assessments for all agencies; identify potential emerging technologies, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems, to expedite the administration of disaster assistance assessments; and develop and submit to Congress a report on the working group's findings that may include recommendations.</summary>
