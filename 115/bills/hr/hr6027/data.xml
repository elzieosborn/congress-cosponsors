This bill amends the Dignified Burial and Other Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2012 to allow a family member to participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry on behalf of a deceased veteran or service member. (The registry is a database designed to allow certain veterans and service members to report deployment exposures to airborne hazards such as smoke from waste disposal burn pits, oil-well fires, or pollution, as well as other exposures and health concerns.)</summary>
