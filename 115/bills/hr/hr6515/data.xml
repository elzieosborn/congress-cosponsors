This bill prohibits any person not affiliated with a state from recovering damages under antitrust law from certain occupational licensing boards or members of such boards. For a board to qualify for this immunity, various conditions must be met, such as the existence of a state law authorizing the board's regulation of a particular profession and the presence of a mechanism for reviewing the board's decisions.</summary>
