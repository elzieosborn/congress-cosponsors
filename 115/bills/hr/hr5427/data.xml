This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permanently reauthorize the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and modify it:

 to allow the Department of Justice to give preference to a COPS program grant applicant that prioritizes hiring veterans or retired law enforcement officers as school resource officers, and to allocate 25% of COPS program funds for grants to establish school-based partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and school systems.</summary>
