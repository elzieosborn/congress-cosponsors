This bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to solicit proposals and authorize it to secure contracts from private entities providing insurance, reinsurance, or capital market investments to transfer a portion of the risk of disaster assistance.

FEMA shall deposit any funds collected as the result of transfer of risk arrangements into the Disaster Relief Fund and such funds shall be available for any purpose for which such fund may be used.

FEMA may annually transfer a portion of the risk of the payments that may be made to private insurance, reinsurance, or the capital markets if it determines that transferring such a portion is in the public interest.</summary>
