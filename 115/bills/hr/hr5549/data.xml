Among other things, the bill allows existing public and private students loans to be refinanced into federal loans, broadly changes loan terms, such as repayment and interest for student loans, authorizes graduate and professional students to receive subsidized Stafford Loans, and makes federal student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings.</summary>
