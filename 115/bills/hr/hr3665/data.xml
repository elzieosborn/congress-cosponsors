  <summary date="2019-08-02T15:09:36Z" status="Introduced in House">South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2017

This bill addresses harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in the Greater Everglades region of Florida. An algal bloom is a rapid growth of algae that may create toxic or hypoxic (severely low-oxygen) conditions that are harmful to humans, animals, aquatic ecosystems, and the economy.

The Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia must assess potential approaches to reduce harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in the region. The task force must also submit a plan, based on the assessment, for reducing, mitigating, and controlling harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in the region.</summary>
