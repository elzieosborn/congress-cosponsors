This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude post-graduation scholarship grants from gross income in the same manner as scholarships are currently excluded.

A "post-graduation scholarship grant" is a grant provided by a program that: (1) is established by certain tax-exempt organizations; (2) is designed to encourage individuals to serve in occupations of unmet needs or in areas of unmet needs; and (3) under which, in accordance with the conditions of a grant, the organization repays any portion of an education loan incurred by an individual to pay higher education expenses.</summary>
