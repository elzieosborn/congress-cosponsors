For each fiscal year, an agency must offset the total incremental cost of its new rules, unless otherwise required by law or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nThe bill excludes from such requirements: (1) rules made with respect to a U.S. military, national security, or foreign affairs function; (2) rules related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or (3) other categories of rules exempted by the OMB."
