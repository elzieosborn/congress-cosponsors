This bill&#160;establishes an alternative method for meeting&#160;the nine-month marriage requirement for certain survivors to receive benefits under the&#160;Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits program. Specifically, the bill applies with respect to a marriage that would not have been recognized by federal law&#160;before June 26, 2013 (the date upon which the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples are entitled to federal benefits).</summary>
