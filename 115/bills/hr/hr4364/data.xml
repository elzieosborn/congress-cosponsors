This bill amends the Clean Air Act to allow states to request a waiver of the reformulated gasoline requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if the price of gasoline is excessively high. (Sale of reformulated gasoline is required in areas with high smog levels.) In making its determination, the EPA must consider the difference in price between conventional and reformulated gasoline. Waivers are not to exceed 42 days and may be renewed.</summary>
