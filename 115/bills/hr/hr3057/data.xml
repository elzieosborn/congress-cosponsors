This bill requires (1) that ranked choice voting (a system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference) be used for all elections for Members of the House of Representatives, (2) that states entitled to six or more Representatives establish districts such that&#160;three to five Representatives are elected from each district, and (3) that states entitled to&#160;fewer than six Representatives elect all Representatives on an at-large basis.

The bill also requires that congressional redistricting be conducted in accordance&#160;with a plan developed by (1) a state-established independent commission; or (2) if such a commission is not enacted, a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.</summary>
