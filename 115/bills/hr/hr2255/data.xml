  <summary date="2018-02-20T20:22:11Z" status="Passed House amended">TITLE I--HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES MADE EASIER

(Sec. 101) This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to deem mortgage appraisal services donated by a fee appraiser to an organization that is eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions to be customary and reasonable.

TITLE II--EXPANDING ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR RURAL JOB CREATORS

(Sec. 201) The bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation within the Securities and Exchange Commission to report on issues encountered by rural-area small businesses.

TITLE III--SENIOR SAFE (Sec. 301) The bill extends immunity from liability to certain individuals who, in good faith and with reasonable care,&#160;disclose the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen to a regulatory or law-enforcement agency. Specifically, this immunity shall&#160;apply to certain credit-union, depository-institution, investment-adviser, broker-dealer,&#160;transfer-agency, insurance-company,&#160;and insurance-agency employees who&#160;have&#160;received specified training related&#160;to identifying&#160;and reporting&#160;the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen. Similarly,&#160;the employing&#160;financial institution shall not be liable with respect to&#160;disclosures made by such employees.

(Sec. 302) The bill allows financial institutions and third-party entities to offer training related to the suspected financial exploitation of a senior citizen to specified employees.
