The report must include a backlog mitigation plan identifying the cause of, and making recommendations to remedy, the backlog.\n\n(Sec. 4) The Executive Office of the President\u00a0must report on the process for conducting and adjudicating security clearance investigations for\u00a0the President's staff.\n\n(Sec. 5)\u00a0The OPM must report on the costs of maintaining comprehensive background investigations capability within both the NBIB and the Department of Defense, compared to the costs of sustaining a single government-wide background investigations enterprise.\n\n(Sec. 6) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) must report on: (1) the status of implementing government-wide continuous evaluation programs, (2) efforts by federal agencies to meet requirements for reciprocal recognition to access classified information, and (3) whether the schedule for processing security clearances should be modified.\n\n(Sec. 7) The ODNI and the OPM must review and make recommendations to Congress and the President, as appropriate, to issue guidance to assist agencies in determining: (1)\u00a0position sensitivity designation, and (2) the appropriate background investigation to initiate for each position designation. The President must report on any issues identified in, and the number of position designations revised as a result of, the review."
