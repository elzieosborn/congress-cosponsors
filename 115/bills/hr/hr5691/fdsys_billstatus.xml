        <text><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Peaceful Learning Act of 2018</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to study railway noise in the United States.</p> <p>DOT must: (1) establish a single system of measuring railway noise that has a highly reliable relationship between projected railway noise exposure and surveyed reactions of individuals to noise and is applied uniformly in measuring railway noise near urbanized areas, (2) establish a single system for determining the exposure of individuals to railway noise in urbanized areas, and (3) determine minimum standards for railway noise levels on the property of a school located in an urbanized area.</p> <p>Each rail operator shall submit to DOT a noise exposure map showing any areas of nonconforming railway noise levels that adversely impact a school located in an urbanized area and are caused by operations of the rail operator. Rail operators who submit a noise exposure map may also submit a noise compatibility program. DOT may award grants to carry out noise compatibility projects.</p>  ]]></text>
