In 2016, Congress transferred certain provisions in chapter 14 (Miscellaneous) and chapter 19 (Indian Land Claims Settlements) of title 25 to new chapters at the end of the title as part of an effort to reclassify the code. To reflect the reclassification of the code, this bill updates references to title 25."
