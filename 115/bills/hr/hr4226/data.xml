This bill automatically designates medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as health professional shortage areas, therefore allowing primary care providers at VA hopsitals to participate in the National Health Service Corps program and receive scholarships or loan repayment.

Individuals may not participate in both the VA's Health Professionals Education Assistance Program and the National Health Service Corps program.

The Department of Health and Human Services, in carrying out the National Health Service Corps program, must consult with the VA regarding health professional shortage areas that are VA medical facilities.</summary>
