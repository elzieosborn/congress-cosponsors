These lands shall be managed under the multiple use and sustained yield mandate of the federal land agency concerned. The federal land agencies concerned shall no longer be bound in managing their respective lands in accordance with the non-impairment standard.\n\nFurthermore, after this bill's enactment, no federal land in Wyoming shall be inventoried as a \"Land with Wilderness Characteristics\" nor shall it be identified as having wilderness characteristics under the planning process of the BLM or the Forest Service."
