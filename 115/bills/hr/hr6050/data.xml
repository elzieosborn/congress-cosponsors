This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to eliminate restrictions on who may purchase catastrophic health plans.

 Catastrophic health plans do not cover any benefits, other than three primary care visits per year, before the deductible is met; such plans are generally characterized by lower premiums and higher deductibles. Currently, only individuals who are younger than 30 years of age or who have a hardship exemption may purchase such plans.</summary>
