This bill requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to establish and newly manufactured firearms to meet a national standard for incorporating passive identification capability into all firearms sold in the United States. Passive identification capability means technology that: (1) enables identification by a mobile or fixed reading device, and (2) does not transmit an electronic monitoring or tracking signal.

In developing a national standard, DOJ must prioritize certain considerations, including a firearm owner's right to privacy and right to legally own firearms and the ability of law enforcement authorities to use passive identification capability to track lost and stolen guns.</summary>
