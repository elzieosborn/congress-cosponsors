This bill amends the federal criminal code to expand the scope of conduct that constitutes unlawful flight to avoid prosecution or giving testimony.

Current law makes it a crime to move or travel in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to avoid prosecution or giving testimony. This bill expands the scope of prohibited conduct to include being present within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or entering or leaving Indian country, with intent to avoid prosecution or giving testimony.</summary>
