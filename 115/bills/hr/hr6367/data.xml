  <summary date="2019-09-06T17:37:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Incentivizing Fairness in Subcontracting Act

This bill amends the Small Business Act to modify provisions regarding what credit is given to small business prime contractors for the use of certain lower-tier subcontractors in order to attain the percentage goals specified in their subcontracting plans. Such credit may (currently, shall) be given if the goals pertain only to single contracts with federal (currently, executive) agencies. The bill eliminates provisions that allow credit to be given if the goals pertain to more than one contract with one or more federal agencies or to one contract with more than one federal agency. Credit is prohibited for subcontracts at any tier required to be reported under a commercial plan or a Department of Defense comprehensive subcontracting plan.

In addition, the bill (1) requires each contracting agency to collect and review data on subcontracting plans, and (2) establishes a dispute process for non-payment to subcontractors.</summary>
