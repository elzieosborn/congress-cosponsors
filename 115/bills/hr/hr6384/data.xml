This bill directs the President, if certain conditions occur, to impose specified economic, property, and U.S. entry sanctions on each person that: (1) operates the Nord Stream 2 pipeline or sells Russian gas to Europe through the such pipeline, or (2) engages in a significant transaction with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. (Nord Stream 2 is an export gas pipeline currently under construction that will run from Russia to Europe across the Baltic Sea.) The Department of State shall report to Congress on the U.S. strategy to support European energy security.</summary>
