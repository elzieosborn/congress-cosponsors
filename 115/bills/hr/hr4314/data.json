(Under current law, Members of Congress who have been convicted of such an offense may continue receiving pension payments until there is a final conviction.)\n\nIf such a conviction is overturned on appeal, the Members may continue receiving their pensions as normal and are also eligible to retroactively receive the pension payments that were denied under this bill."
