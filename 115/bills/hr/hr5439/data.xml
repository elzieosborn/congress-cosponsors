  <summary date="2018-09-17T19:23:32Z" status="Passed House amended">(Sec. 1) This bill requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide a single point of contact for any taxpayer whose tax return has been delayed or otherwise adversely affected due to tax-related identity theft. The single point of contact must track the taxpayer's case to completion and coordinate with other IRS employees to resolve case issues as quickly as possible.

The single point of contact must consist of a team or subset of specially trained employees who: (1) have the ability to work across functions to resolve the issues involved in the taxpayer's case, and (2) are accountable for handling the case until its resolution.</summary>
