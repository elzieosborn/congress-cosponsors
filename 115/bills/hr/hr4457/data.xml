  <summary date="2019-08-27T20:00:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans Empowerment Act

This bill restructures the delivery of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care through private non-VA providers.

The Veterans Accountable Care Organization is established as a federally chartered corporation to permit veterans who are eligible for VA health care to choose to receive health care from private-sector providers. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospital care, medical services, and other health care functions and personnel (excluding nursing home care and domiciliary care) are transferred to the organization.

The bill establishes in the VHA the Veterans Health Insurance program to provide veterans with insurance coverage for both VA and private health care.</summary>
