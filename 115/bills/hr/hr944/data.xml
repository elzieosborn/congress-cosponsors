This bill amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to make it unlawful for a chief state election administration official to take active part in political management or in a political campaign with respect to any election for federal office over which the official has supervisory authority.

 This prohibition does not apply to a chief state election administration official regarding a campaign in which the official or an immediate family member is a candidate.</summary>
