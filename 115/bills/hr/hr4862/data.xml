This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow distributions from qualified tuition programs (known as 529 plans) to be used for certain expenses in connection with a homeschool (whether treated as a homeschool or a private school for purposes of state law).

The expenses include: curriculum and curricular materials, books or other instructional materials, online educational materials, tuition for tutoring or educational classes outside of the home (if the tutor or instructor is not related to the student), dual enrollment in an institution of higher education, and educational therapies for students with disabilities.</summary>
