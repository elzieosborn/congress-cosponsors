  <summary date="2019-08-21T17:13:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act of 2018

This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it unlawful for a federal law enforcement officer to engage in a sexual act with an individual who is under arrest, in detention, or in custody.

Consent is not a defense to prosecution for unlawful conduct. A violator is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to 15 years, or both.

Additionally, the bill authorizes the Department of Justice to make grants to states that have in effect similar laws. Grants must be used for the same purposes as formula grants under the STOP Violence Against Women Program and the Sexual Assault Services Program.</summary>
