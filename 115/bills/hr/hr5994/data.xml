This bill directs the Department of Transportation to establish a competitive grant program to provide grants for resilience projects that strengthen and protect evacuation routes that are essential for providing and supporting mass evacuations caused by emergency events. The bill defines "resilience project" to mean a project: (1) with the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions; and (2) designed and built to address current and future vulnerabilities to an evacuation route.</summary>
