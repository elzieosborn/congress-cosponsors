This bill authorizes the General Services Administration to transfer to the government of Guam surplus property of federal agencies located on Guam as compensation for unreimbursed impact expenses claimed by Guam under the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003.

The Department of Defense (DOD) shall maintain an inventory of all land parcels on Guam which are currently owned by the federal government and administered by DOD which it expects to transfer to Guam.

The bill repeals the conditions on certain lands conveyed to Guam by the Department of the Navy pursuant to the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1981.</summary>
