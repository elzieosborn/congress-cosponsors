A governmental entity may only disclose such information for law enforcement purposes pursuant to a warrant, a court order, or in emergency circumstances.\n\nThe bill prohibits: (1) the use of private drones to capture images of individuals in private activities who have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (2) any investigative or law enforcement officer or private individual from operating a drone that is armed with a firearm."
