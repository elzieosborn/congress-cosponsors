    "text": "DEA Enforcement and Authority Act of 2018\n\nThis bill amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to modify enforcement authorities of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nThe bill modifies the required elements of an order to show cause issued by the DEA before it denies, revokes, or suspends a registration for a CSA violation. Specifically, it eliminates the requirement for an order to show cause to notify the registrant of the opportunity to submit a corrective action plan.\n\nAdditionally, the bill modifies the standard of review for an immediate suspension order. Currently, the DEA may immediately suspend the registration of a controlled substances manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser to prevent imminent danger to the public health and safety. This bill lowers the standard for determining imminent danger to the public health and safety\u2014from substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that harm will occur to probable cause to believe an imminent threat that harm or diversion will occur."
