  <summary date="2018-09-21T21:34:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill specifies that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation may test models to: (1) help individuals learn about the availability of psychologist services under Medicare, and (2) explore the use of a behavioral health help-line that is available 24-7 to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency department visits through treatment education.

The Government Accountability Office must report on the availability of behavioral health services under Medicare.</summary>
