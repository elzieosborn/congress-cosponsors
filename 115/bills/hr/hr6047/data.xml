  <summary date="2018-07-10T18:48:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Synthetic Abuse and Labeling of Toxic Substances Act of 2018 or the SALTS Act This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to set forth factors that may be considered to determine whether a controlled substance analogue is intended for human consumption. (Under current law, a controlled substance analogue that is intended for human consumption is treated as a schedule I controlled substance. A schedule I controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that: has a high potential for abuse; has no currently accepted medical value; and is subject to regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act.)</summary>
