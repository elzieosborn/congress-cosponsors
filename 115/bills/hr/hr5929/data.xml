This bill provides for various programs to promote small business concerns located in the U.S. Virgin Islands, such as by (1) doubling the credit that a federal agency receives for awarding a prime contract to such businesses for the purposes of determining the agency's compliance with small business procurement goals, (2) allowing the Small Business Administration (SBA) to waive certain requirements when transferring surplus U.S. government property or technology to such businesses, and (3) directing the SBA to identify potential incentives to contractors that subcontract to such businesses under the SBA Mentor-Protege Program.</summary>
