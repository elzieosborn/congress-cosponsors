This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to health professional training programs for training that addresses implicit bias (e.g., racial bias) in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and the Health Resources and Services Administration must award grants to up to 10 states for pregnancy medical home programs that reduce adverse maternal health outcomes and racial disparities. Among other requirements, such programs must prioritize the care of Medicaid enrollees.

The National Academy of Medicine must make recommendations for incorporating bias recognition in clinical skills tests at medical schools.</summary>
