This bill requires the Department of Energy to provide competitive grants for making energy improvements in schools. Specifically, grants may be awarded for:

 any improvement, repair, or renovation to a school that will result in a direct reduction in school energy costs; any improvement, repair, renovation, or installation that leads to an improvement in teacher and student health, such as indoor air quality; and the installation of renewable energy technologies (e.g., wind power) involved in the improvement, repair, or renovation to a school.</summary>
