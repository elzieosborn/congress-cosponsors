This bill makes a family eligible for housing assistance in connection with a major disaster, including Hurricane Maria of 2017, if it: (1) is occupying an otherwise unused or uninhabited property located in the area for which the major disaster was declared but does not have documented ownership rights to, and is not renting, the property; or (2) is renting a property located in the area for which the major disaster was declared but does not have a written lease for such rental.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall consider a wide range of evidence in determining the eligibility of a family for housing assistance.

FEMA shall enter into agreements with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to implement a Disaster Housing Assistance Program to provide temporary rental assistance to families displaced by any major disaster during 2017, and shall consult on the implementation of the program for future disasters.</summary>
