Specifically, the Department of the Interior must issue a rule to remove the gray wolf in the contiguous 48 states from the list of endangered or threatened species and reinstate a rule that removed the gray wolf in the Western Great Lakes region from the list. The bill exempts those rules from judicial review as well as a rule that removed the gray wolf in Wyoming from the list."
