This bill extends through FY2022, and revises allocations from, the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

The bill makes allocations available from the fund&#160;for the Payment In-Lieu of Taxes Program. This program compensates local governments for tax revenue lost due to tax-exempt federal lands within their boundaries.

Allocations shall be made available from the fund through FY2024 to promote offshore energy exploration, innovation, and education.

The Department of the Interior shall carry out a federal energy permit streamlining pilot program for the outer Continental Shelf.

The bill directs Interior to: (1) establish an Offshore Energy Innovation Hub; (2) award offshore energy innovation grants to institutions of higher education; and (3) prepare a list of the science, technology, engineering, and math-related academic fields that address current and future workforce needs for offshore energy-related activities.</summary>
