  <summary date="2019-08-16T18:49:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Child Gun Access Prevention Act

This bill authorizes the Department of Justice to award state grants to implement child access prevention laws. A child access prevention law prohibits an adult from leaving an unsecured firearm in a manner that is known to be, or reasonably should be known to be, accessible to a child.

Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must study and report to Congress: (1) on child injuries and deaths resulting from firearms, and (2) on safe storage practices for firearms.

Finally, the bill amends the federal criminal code to require a licensed firearms dealer to provide gun safety information, including safe storage practices, to a firearm purchaser.</summary>
