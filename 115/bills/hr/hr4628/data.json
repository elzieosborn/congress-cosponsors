    "text": "Industrial Mineral Parity Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to allow for modified permits for industrial minerals remining operations. The term \"industrial minerals\" means limestone, clay, sand, gravel, diatomite, kaolin, bentonite, silica, barite, gypsum, or talc. To qualify for a modified permit, an industrial minerals remining operation must occur at a site on which coal mining was conducted before the effective date of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977."
