  <summary date="2017-08-09T17:16:50Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to establish a five-year pilot program to expand Medicare coverage of telehealth services for enrollees who reside in public housing. Specifically, the program shall provide for Medicare coverage with respect to "store-and-forward technologies" (i.e., the electronic transmission of medical information, such as digital images), which are covered as telehealth services&#160;under current law only&#160;with respect to&#160;demonstration programs conducted in Alaska and Hawaii. In addition, the program shall provide for increased flexibility with respect to geographic and&#160;other requirements.</summary>
