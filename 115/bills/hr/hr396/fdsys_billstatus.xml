        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>Tax Accountability Act of 2017</b></p> <p>This bill declares that no government contracts or grants should be awarded to individuals or companies with seriously delinquent federal tax debts.</p> <p>Agencies offering a grant or issuing a solicitation for bids or a request for proposals for a contract in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) shall require each person that submits a grant application, bid, or proposal to: (1) certify whether such person has a seriously delinquent tax debt, and (2) authorize the Department of the Treasury to disclose to the agency whether the person has a seriously delinquent tax debt.</p> <p>Agencies shall consider a person who has a seriously delinquent tax debt not to be a responsible source and thus the person may not be awarded contracts. Agencies must consider a grant applicant who has a seriously delinquent tax debt high risk, shall decline the grant application, and must ensure that the applicant does not receive future grants offered by the agency.</p> <p>Subject to waiver, agencies shall initiate a suspension or debarment proceeding against a person making offers or applying for grants who has a seriously delinquent tax debt or who falsely certified whether the person has a seriously delinquent tax debt. </p> <p>Individuals with seriously delinquent tax debts are not eligible for federal employment. Agencies must provide for review of public records to determine if a tax lien has been filed on employees or applicants for employment. Agencies may take certain personnel action against employees who fail to file a tax return or understate their tax liability. </p>]]></text>
