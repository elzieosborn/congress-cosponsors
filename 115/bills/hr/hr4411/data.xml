This bill directs the Department of State to make available to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for each calendar quarter a copy of the report issued by a U.S. embassy or consulate relating to the overseas death of a U.S. citizen.

The Public Health Service Act is amended to direct the CDC to expand its surveillance programs of U.S. citizen deaths abroad, including through the use of the reports made available pursuant to the Ravi Thackurdeen Travel Safety Act.</summary>
