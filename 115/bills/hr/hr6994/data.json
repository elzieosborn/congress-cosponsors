Family members of veterans who resided at Wurtsmith Air Force Base are also eligible for hospital care and medical services under this bill.\n\nThe bill also provides a presumption of service connection for veterans who were exposed to volatile organic compounds while serving at Wurtsmith Air Force Base. Under a presumption of service connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded."
