This bill amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to allow financial assistance provided by the Rural Utilities Service for the deployment of broadband-capable infrastructure by a service provider to be used to provide retail fixed broadband service in an area where there is no qualifying broadband-capable infrastructure owned or operated by another service provider. The term "qualifying broadband-capable infrastructure" means fixed broadband-capable infrastructure: (1) used by a service provider to provide fixed broadband service for which the provider receives universal service support funds, and (2) was financed&#160;with funds from the Department of Agriculture.&#160;</summary>
