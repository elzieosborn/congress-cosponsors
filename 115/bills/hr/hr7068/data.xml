This bill modifies provisions related to unaccompanied inadmissible alien children, such as directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to repatriate such children, where DHS currently has discretion whether to do so. It also modifies provisions relating to asylum seekers, including raising the standard of proof required to establish a credible fear of persecution.</summary>
