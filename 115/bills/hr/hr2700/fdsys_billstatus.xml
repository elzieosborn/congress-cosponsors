        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>Workforce Development Investment Act of 2017 </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit of $5,000 for each community college, other institution of higher education, or area career and technical education school engaged in a qualified partnership with the employer. The bill allows a maximum credit of $20,000 in any taxable year. </p> <p>Within six months of the enactment of this bill, the Department of Education must define the term &quot;qualified partnership.&quot; The term must include a partnership through which an employer: (1) collaborates with an educational institution to help develop curriculum in order to improve workforce development and job training for students; (2) helps provide instruction to students in the classroom; and (3) provides internships, apprenticeships, or other similar educational opportunities in the workplace for students. </p> <p>This bill also allows employers a worker training tax credit equal to the lesser of: 50% of the job training program expenditures for a full-time employee participating in a qualified training program, or $5,000. A &quot;qualified training program&quot; is: (1) a qualified partnership, or (2) an apprenticeship program registered and certified with the Department of Labor under the National Apprenticeship Act. </p>]]></text>
