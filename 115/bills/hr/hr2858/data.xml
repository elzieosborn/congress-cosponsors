  <summary date="2019-08-06T19:20:17Z" status="Introduced in House">SUper Pollutant Emissions Reduction Act of 2017 or the SUPER Act of 2017

 This bill requires the President to establish the Task Force on Super Pollutants to:

 review existing and potential policies and measures that promote the reduction of short-lived climate pollutants, in part by identifying and evaluating programs and activities of the federal government that contribute to a reduction; identify and recommend specific federal programs and activities that are duplicative and that can be consolidated to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness; identify gaps where programs do not exist and recommend programs and activities to fill these gaps to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, with an emphasis on industry standards and public-private partnerships; identify activities where reductions in those pollutants can continue to spur innovation and job creation and increase U.S. competitiveness in the global market for new technologies to replace those using short-lived climate pollutants; identify, compile, evaluate, and develop best practices for reducing those pollutants; and report to Congress on its findings and recommendations. A "short-lived climate pollutant" is black carbon, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, tropospheric ozone and its precursors, or emissions from banks of ozone-depleting substances.</summary>
