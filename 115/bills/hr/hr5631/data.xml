  <summary date="2019-03-12T18:42:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Workforce Mobility Act of 2018

This bill prohibits an employer from entering into a covenant not to compete with any employee of such employer. A "covenant not to compete" is an agreement between an employer and employee that restricts such employee from performing any work for another employer for a specified period of time, any work in a specified geographic area, or any work for another employer that is similar to the work performed for the employer who is a party to such agreement. Such an agreement in an employment contract is presumed to be illegal as anticompetitive unless the employer establishes otherwise.

An aggrieved party may file a civil action for actual and punitive damages, and reasonable attorney's fees and costs if the action is successful.</summary>
