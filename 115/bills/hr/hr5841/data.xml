  <summary date="2019-07-24T15:47:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 

This bill amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to revise the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States' (CFIUS's) authority to review the national security implications of foreign investments. The definition of a "covered transaction" subject to CFIUS review is amended to include certain real estate transactions, sensitive transactions involving countries of special concern, and asset transfers pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. Other topics revised by this bill include mitigation agreements, required CFIUS review factors, and CFIUS funding and resources.

The bill delays to 2021 the National Credit Union Administration rule titled "Risk-Based Capital" published on October 29, 2015.
