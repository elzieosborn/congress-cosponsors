The President must establish an interagency process to identify emerging technologies essential to national security.\n\nAnti-Boycott Act of 2018 \n\nThe President must issue regulations prohibiting specified actions with respect to foreign boycotts against a country friendly to the United States.\n\nThe President must impose sanctions regarding the export, the transfer, or efforts by a foreign country to use or acquire specified weapons technology."
