  <summary date="2018-06-14T19:09:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Supporting the Teaching profession through Revitalizing Investments in Valuable Educators Act or the STRIVE Act

This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide qualifying teachers with a new, incremental&#160;loan-cancellation program. Specifically, with respect to a 12-month period,&#160;the Department of Education (ED) must cancel a specified portion of a borrower's qualifying Federal Direct Loan Program loans if the borrower: (1) has made 12 consecutive on-time monthly payments, (2) is employed in a qualifying teaching position at the time of such cancellation, and (3)&#160;was employed in a qualifying teaching position during the period in which the borrower made the 12 payments.&#160;After&#160;a borrower has received such partial loan&#160;cancellation for&#160;a specified&#160;number of years, ED&#160;must cancel the borrower's eligible loans in full.&#160;&#160;

The bill also:

 increases and extends funding for teacher training; makes changes to the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education&#160;grant program, including by increasing annual award amounts and&#160;making early childhood teachers eligible for such grants; requires&#160;ED to award grants to states to subsidize teacher certification and licensing fees for low-income individuals who have entered the teaching profession; expands the teacher quality partnership grant program to include early childhood educators; and increases&#160;the tax deduction for school expenses&#160;and extends the deduction&#160;to early childhood educators.</summary>
