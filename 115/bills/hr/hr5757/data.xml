This bill expands the authority of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to exclude from participation in federal health programs certain affiliates of a sanctioned entity. (A "sanctioned entity" is one that has been convicted of one of several specified crimes or&#160;excluded from participation under either Medicare or a state health care program.)

In addition, the bill requires Medicare Advantage organizations to report instances of fraud or abuse to the CMS within 60 days.</summary>
