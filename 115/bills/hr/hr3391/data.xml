  <summary date="2018-02-16T16:01:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Medical Marijuana Research Act of 2017

This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to establish a new, separate registration process to facilitate research with marijuana for medical purposes. The Drug Enforcement Administration must register: (1) practitioners to conduct medical marijuana research, and (2) manufacturers and distributors to supply marijuana for such research.

The Department of Health and Human Services must continue to produce marijuana through the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program and offer to sell immature plants and seeds to researchers until manufacturers and distributors can provide a sufficient supply of marijuana for medical research.</summary>
