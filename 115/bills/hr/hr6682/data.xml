This bill amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to instruct the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide advance written notification to each owner of land that is adjacent to a parcel to be acquired to become public lands or National Forest System (NFS) lands.

Interior or USDA must provide advance written notification to each owner of land that is adjacent to a parcel of public lands or NFS lands to be conveyed by sale, exchange, or other disposal method.

The Bureau of Land Management, before commencing a resurvey of federal land under its administrative jurisdiction, must notify all property owners who have land abutting or adjacent to the land being resurveyed.</summary>
