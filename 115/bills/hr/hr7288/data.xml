This bill provides a presumption of service connection for certain diseases for burn pit-exposed veterans. Under a presumption of service connection, specific disabilities diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded. A burn pit-exposed veteran is a veteran who was stationed at a location where an open burn pit (an area used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment) was used while deployed on or after September 11, 2001.</summary>
