The bill allows an individual who is not a&#160;federal employee to enroll in&#160;the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, unless the&#160;individual: (1) is&#160;enrolled, or eligible to enroll, in a different public health insurance program; (2) is a member of the uniformed services; or (3) is not a citizen or national of, or lawfully present in, the United States. An employer may make a contribution on behalf of such an individual, but no government contribution may be provided.</summary>
