Accelerating Access to Capital Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise Form S-3 so as to permit securities to be registered pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1. of the form if the registrant has at least one class of common equity securities listed and registered on a national securities exchange. The SEC must also revise General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 to allow certain registrants to use that instruction&#160;to offer up to one-third of the aggregate market value of their common equity even if they are not registered on a national securities exchange.</summary>
