  <summary date="2018-03-22T16:14:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act 

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the eligibility requirements for the premium assistance tax credit, which is provided to eligible individuals and families to subsidize the purchase of health insurance plans on an exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

The bill expands eligibility for the credit by defining an "applicable taxpayer" as a taxpayer whose household income for the taxable year equals or exceeds 100% of the federal poverty line. (Under current law, household income must equal or exceed 100%, but may not exceed 400% of the poverty line.)</summary>
