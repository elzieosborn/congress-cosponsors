This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt individuals from the requirement to maintain minimum essential health care coverage if they reside in a county where fewer than two health insurers offer insurance on the health insurance exchange. This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to extend the requirement for participation in a health insurance exchange to the President, Vice President, executive branch political appointees, and employees of congressional committees and leadership offices of Congress. Currently, this requirement applies to Members of Congress and their staff.

The government is prohibited from contributing to or subsidizing the health insurance coverage of officials and employees subject to this requirement.</summary>
