The program must include the functions of the training program with the same name that was operating before this bill's enactment and the following initiatives:\n\n engaging stakeholders to develop a flexible training module, providing technical assistance relating to program activities, developing a methodology for collecting and reporting data on the number of human trafficking victims served through the program, and integrating program training with other types of training for health care and social service providers (e.g., training regarding sexual assault victims)."
