Under current law, states are not permitted to give postsecondary education benefits to\u00a0such aliens on the basis of residency, but are allowed to give such benefits based on other criteria. This bill eliminates the option to give such benefits based on any criteria if they are not available to all U.S. citizens and nationals.\n\nIn addition, the bill grants a private right of action to a person who is aggrieved by a violation of this requirement."
