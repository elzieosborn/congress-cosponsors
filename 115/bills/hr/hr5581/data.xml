This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from registering, or renewing the registration of, a practitioner who is licensed to prescribe opioids in schedule II, III, IV, or V unless the practitioner completes a training program that includes information on opioids.

The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on the effects of the amendments made by this bill, including whether there has been a reduction in opioids prescribed and in opioid-related overdoses and death.</summary>
