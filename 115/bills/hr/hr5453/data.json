The bill authorizes hospitals, child care centers, clinics, and similar institutions to test newborns for ALD in accordance with state protocols; such protocols must be approved by the Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes through FY2022 the heritable disorders screening program for newborns and children that is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration."
