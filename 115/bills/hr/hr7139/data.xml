This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require asylum applicants to arrive in the United States only at a designated port of arrival. Current law allows aliens to seek asylum whether or not they arrive at a designated port.

The bill also requires asylum seekers to file their applications immediately upon arrival, where currently they have one year to do so.</summary>
