This bill revises the notification requirement to Congress of the evacuation from a theater of combat and hospitalization of any member of the Armed Forces. Current law requires such notification only when a seriously wounded service member is transferred to a military hospital within the United States. This bill would expand the requirement to include hospitalizations in any military treatment facility, not just facilities in the United States.</summary>
