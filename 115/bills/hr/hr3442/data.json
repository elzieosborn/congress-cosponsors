The GAO must report to Congress on such study within one year of the enactment of this bill.\n\nOnce the GAO issues such report, the bill applies the Congressional Review Act to major rules that are in effect on this bill's enactment. Thus, Congress may nullify an existing rule through a joint resolution of disapproval that receives a majority vote in both chambers."
