This bill credits an&#160;individual with deemed wages, for purposes of calculating Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits,&#160;for up to five years of service as a caregiver of a dependent relative. Specifically, an individual shall be deemed to have been paid a wage (according to a specified formula) during each month in which the individual was engaged for at least 80 hours in providing care to a dependent relative without monetary compensation. However, this requirement&#160;shall not apply if a larger benefit or payment would otherwise be payable.</summary>
