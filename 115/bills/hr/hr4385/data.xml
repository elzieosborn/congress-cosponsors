This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of a drug in the first three years after the drug's approval. The Food and Drug Administration may: (1) waive the third year of this prohibition for a drug if direct-to-consumer advertising of the drug would have an affirmative value to public health, or (2) extend the prohibition if the drug has significant adverse health effects.</summary>
