This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE)to establish and carry out a program to provide grants to states, local governments, and electric utilities to make electric infrastructure more resilient to hurricanes, tornadoes, and other major weather-related events.

DOE must give priority in awarding grants to governments and electric utilities that serve areas historically prone to hurricanes, tornadoes, or other major weather-related events.

The federal share of the costs of a project or activity carried out using a grant under the program may not exceed 50%.</summary>
