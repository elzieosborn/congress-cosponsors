This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to report annually on grants not awarded under each of its programs that aim to make education more accessible or affordable. For each program, ED must publish a report on the 10 applications that were not funded (completely or partially), but showed the greatest potential to make higher education more accessible or affordable or ease borrowers' student debt burdens.</summary>
