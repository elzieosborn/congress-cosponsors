        <text><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Truth in Settlements Act of 2017</strong></p> <p> This bill sets forth new requirements for the public disclosure of any covered settlement agreement entered into by a federal executive agency. The bill defines "covered settlement agreement" as a settlement agreement (including a consent decree) that: (1) is entered into by an executive agency, (2) relates to an alleged violation of federal civil or criminal law, and (3) requires the payment of at least $1 million by one or more non-federal persons (entities not within the federal government).</p> <p>Each executive agency must make publicly available on the agency website&nbsp;a list of each covered settlement agreement entered into by the agency, which shall include:&nbsp;(1) the names of the parties to the settlement&nbsp;agreement and the date of such agreement; (2) a description of the claims that were settled under the agreement; (3) the amount each party to the agreement is obligated to pay under the terms of the agreement and the total amounts required to be paid; and (4) for each settling party, the amount the settling party is obligated to pay that has been expressly specified as a civil penalty or fine and as not deductible for tax purposes. The bill requires: (1) such information to remain publicly available for not less than five years, beginning on the date of the agreement; and (2) a copy of a covered settlement agreement to remain publicly available for a period of not less than one year, beginning on the date of the agreement, or for at least five years for an agreement under which a non-federal person is required to pay not less than $50 million.</p> <p>The bill limits the disclosure of provisions of a covered settlement agreement that are subject to a confidentiality agreement. </p> <p>The issuer of securities subject to reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 must describe in required reports any claim of a tax deduction relating to a payment under a covered settlement agreement.</p>]]></text>
