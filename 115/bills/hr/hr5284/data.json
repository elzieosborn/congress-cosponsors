    "text": "Sunset Act of 2018\n\nThis bill revises requirements governing congressional review of agency rules. Before implementing new rules, agencies must: (1) report to the Government Accountability Office on their rules, and (2) obtain congressional approval of the rule. The bill redefines \"rule\" to exclude: (1) a rule of particular applicability (e.g., a rule that approves corporate or financial structures); (2) a rule relating to agency management or personnel; or (3) a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of nonagency parties.\n\nThis bill permits judicial review of whether an agency has completed the necessary requirements for a rule to take effect.\n\nThe bill terminates an agency rule 10 years after it was approved by Congress. The President may exempt a rule from termination if such rule is: (1) necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal law, or for national security; or (2) issued to implement an international trade agreement."
