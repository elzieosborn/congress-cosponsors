  <summary date="2019-09-03T19:28:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Nevada Lands Bill Technical Corrections Act of 2018

This bill modifies provisions concerning lands in Nevada. Specifically, the bill:

 repeals the expedited program for the examination of unpatented mining claims within the mining townsites in Virginia City in Storey County; requires the exterior boundaries of identified "subject federal land" in Storey County to be surveyed as the conveyed townsites; requires implementation of a multispecies habitat conservation plan in Lincoln County; provides for the implementation of certain rangeland and woodland restoration projects, particularly for pinyon-juniper dominated landscapes, in Lincoln County; requires cooperative agreements for certain law enforcement and planning-related activities in Lincoln County; provides for the use of certain land sale proceeds in Lincoln and White Pine Counties; adjusts the boundaries of the Mt. Moriah Wilderness and Arc Dome Wilderness; and establishes a deadline for a land conveyance to White Pine County. The U.S. Postal Service shall designate a single zip code for Storey County.

The Department of the Interior shall realign a specified portion of an identified 2,640-foot wide corridor established on public land for utilities in Lincoln and Clark Counties.

The bill affirms and validates a certain patent for the benefit of desert tortoise and other species and their habitats in Clark County.

The Bureau of Land Management may issue a corrective patent for specified land in Lincoln County.</summary>
