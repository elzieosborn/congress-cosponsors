Specifically, the bill:\n\n repeals the expedited program for the examination of unpatented mining claims within the mining townsites in Virginia City in Storey County; requires the exterior boundaries of identified \"subject federal land\" in Storey County to be surveyed as the conveyed townsites; requires implementation of a multispecies habitat conservation plan in Lincoln County; provides for the implementation of certain rangeland and woodland restoration projects, particularly for pinyon-juniper dominated landscapes, in Lincoln County; requires cooperative agreements for certain law enforcement and planning-related activities in Lincoln County; provides for the use of certain land sale proceeds in Lincoln and White Pine Counties; adjusts the boundaries of the Mt. Moriah Wilderness and Arc Dome Wilderness; and establishes a deadline for a land conveyance to White Pine County. The U.S. Postal Service shall designate a single zip code for Storey County.\n\nThe Department of the Interior shall realign a specified portion of an identified 2,640-foot wide corridor established on public land for utilities in Lincoln and Clark Counties.\n\nThe bill affirms and validates a certain patent for the benefit of desert tortoise and other species and their habitats in Clark County.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management may issue a corrective patent for specified land in Lincoln County."
