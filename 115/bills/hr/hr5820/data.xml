This bill prohibits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from using federal funds to construct or expand immigration detention facilities.

The bill provides for increased oversight of immigration detention facilities by the Inspector General of DHS, including through unannounced annual inspections, health and safety inspections, and audits to ensure compliance with protections against sexual abuse and violence against women.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of DHS shall investigate civil rights and civil liberties complaints in immigration detention facilities.</summary>
