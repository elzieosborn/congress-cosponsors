This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report annually to Congress and the public on: (1) the ten most prevalent&#160;health care fraud schemes targeted to seniors, (2)&#160;steps being taken to combat such schemes,&#160;and (3) policy suggestions to improve protections for seniors.

HHS may omit certain information from an annual report if public disclosure would compromise an ongoing investigation or educate criminals rather than seniors.

HHS shall disseminate reports to Medicare beneficiaries as specified by the bill.</summary>
