Such temporary disability rating shall remain in effect until a formal rating decision is issued.\n\nThe VA shall provide hospital care and medical services to such veterans while they are waiting for a formal disability rating. If the VA determines that a veteran does not have a service-connected disability and does not qualify for VA medical services the veteran shall not owe the VA for such services and the VA shall assist the veteran in finding non-VA medical services."
