  <summary date="2022-09-19T13:43:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses support for the goals and ideals of a National Move Over Law Day.

Urges the National Towing Foundation to spread awareness of, and adherence to, state move over laws.

Move Over laws generally require motorists to move at least one lane over when there is an emergency or rescue activity taking place on the shoulder or side of the roadway, or, if unable to do so safely, to slow down and pass the scene with caution.</summary>
