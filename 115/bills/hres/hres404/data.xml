  <summary date="2017-09-25T22:00:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that in order to eliminate the undue influence of money in politics:

 Congress should create a small donor and public finance system for congressional elections, which will ensure that Congress is responsible to voters instead of well-financed special interests; and Members of Congress should devote their full time to regular order and governing instead of campaign fundraising.</summary>
