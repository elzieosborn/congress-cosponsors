    "text": "Reaffirms: (1) the importance of the U.S.-Republic of Korea (South Korea) alliance as a linchpin for security, stability, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, in the Asia-Pacific region, and beyond; (2) U.S. support for South Korean forces and continued combined exercises through the region; and (3) that the U.S. military presence in South Korea should not be included or discussed in any potential negotiation with North Korea.\n\nReinforces longstanding U.S. commitments to defend South Korea, to include providing a full spectrum of extended deterrence.\n\nUrges the governments of the United States and South Korea to take the opportunity of President Trump's upcoming state visit to South Korea to send a message to North Korea that: (1) destabilizing provocations will be met with a resolute response by the U.S.-South Korea combined forces; and (2) if North Korea instead takes a step in the right direction, the United States, South Korea, and the international community are ready to present a brighter future.\n\nRecognizes that the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement is mutually beneficial and has been contributing to the alliance. Encourages the United States and South Korea to: (1) work together to resolve any outstanding issues through the bilateral consultative process, and (2) continue broadening and deepening the alliance by enhancing cooperation and building new partnerships."
