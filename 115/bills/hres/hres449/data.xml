  <summary date="2017-10-31T14:57:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Calls upon: (1) Kenya to hold free and fair presidential elections in August 2017 and to condemn the use of hate speech and the incitement of violence by political candidates, the media, or any Kenyan citizens; (2) Kenyan citizens to peacefully participate in the general elections and seek to resolve any disputes over results through the legal system; and (3) Kenyan political candidates to respect the Electoral Code of Conduct and the Political Party Code of Conduct.

Encourages: (1) Kenyan political parties, civil society, and the media to act responsibly with their parallel vote tabulations; (2) Kenyan civil society organizations to continue providing early warning and response measures to mitigate election-related violence and strengthen democratic processes; and (3) the Trump Administration to appoint an Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.

Commends the key role the faith-based community has played in ensuring a peaceful pre- and post-election environment through periodically convening the Multi-Sectoral Forum to deliberate on matters of governance, election management, and looming insecurity.

Supports efforts by the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development to assist election-related preparations in Kenya.

Calls upon the United States and Kenya's other international partners to continue to support Kenya's efforts to address the remaining electoral preparation challenges and identify gaps in which additional resources or diplomatic engagement could make important contributions to the conduct of the elections.</summary>
