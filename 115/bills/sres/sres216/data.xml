  <summary date="2017-10-31T20:19:35Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Calls on the government of Iran to: (1) release Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi, Nizar Zakka, and any other U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident alien, or foreign national being unjustly detained in Iran; and (2) fulfill its promises to assist in locating and returning Robert Levinson.

Encourages the President to: (1) take meaningful action to secure the release of such individuals if Iran does not do so, and (2) make the release of U.S. citizens and legal permanent resident aliens held hostage by the Iranian government the highest of priorities.

Requests the United States and its allies whose nationals have been detained to consider establishing a multinational task force to secure the release of the detainees.</summary>
