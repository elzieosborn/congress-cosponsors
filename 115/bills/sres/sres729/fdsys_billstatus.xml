Specifies that an amendment that is exempted from the requirement may only be agreed to upon a vote of three-fifths of all Senators.</p> <p>Authorizes the majority leader and minority leader, by mutual agreement, to call up additional germane amendments under this rule in equal number by members of the majority and of the minority.</p> <p>Limits consideration of such an amendment by the Senate to two hours, divided equally between the majority and the minority.</p>]]></text>
