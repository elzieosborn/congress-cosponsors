  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) estimate the funds and resources necessary for the post-war reconstruction of Iraq and to submit those estimates to Congress; (2) design a transitional security force for Iraq; (3) develop a plan to reconstitute security, law, and justice institutions in Iraq and to restore to Iraqis the responsibility for managing their own affairs; (4) develop a plan to respond to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people; (5) consider the most crucial security threat, the need to secure Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (including biological and chemical precursors) in order to ensure that they are not stolen or transferred to terrorists or other parties inimical to the United States during a post-Saddam Hussein government; (6) develop measures necessary to temporarily steward Iraq's natural resources; (7) make provisions to establish an interim government that commands popular legitimacy so it can administer the Iraqi state; and (8) develop plans for diplomatic initiatives to take advantage of any opportunity to influence political developments in the Middle East following a conflict in Iraq, including pressing for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</summary>
