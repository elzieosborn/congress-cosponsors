  <summary date="2004-02-24T16:22:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Calls upon the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government to avoid implementing any law that restricts freedom of thought and expression, and to schedule and conduct elections for the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR according to rules approved by the people of Hong Kong.

 Calls upon the President of the United States to: (1) urge the SAR Government not to implement any such law; (2) urge the People's Republic of China (PRC) to leave all revisions of Hong Kong law to a democratically-elected legislature, to respect the autonomy and independence of the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the chief executive, civil service, judiciary and police of Hong Kong, and to honor its obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984; and (3) declare that the continued lack of an elected legislature in Hong Kong constitutes a violation of such Declaration.</summary>
