Allows an Indian tribe located on a low-income reservation to receive a grant without conducting an assessment to determine the immediate need for a control program. Defines \"low-income reservation\" as one on which not less than 40 percent of residents are from families with incomes below the poverty line established annually by the Office of Management and Budget."
