    "text": "Federal Acknowledgment Process Reform Act of 2004 - (Sec. 4) Prescribes the process for petition for Federal acknowledgment of Indian groups, including letter of intent and evidence of historical existence.\n\nDefines the responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs for publication, review, and final determination of petitions.\n\nPermits the petitioner to seek judicial review of the final determination in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nDeclares the intent of Congress that, in accordance with Federal law relating to interpretations of treaties and Acts of Congress affecting the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities of Indian tribes, any ambiguity in this Act be liberally construed in favor of an Indian group or Indian tribe.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2013.\n\n(Sec. 5) Specifies the requirements a petitioner must provide in a petition for acknowledgment.\n\nSpecifies factors the Secretary may use as evidence of community and the criteria to be used to consider a petitioner to have provided sufficient evidence of community.\n\nRequires a petition to include a statement and analysis of facts establishing that the petitioner Indian group has maintained political influence or authority over members of the petitioner throughout the historical period. Specifies criteria by which the Assistant Secretary shall consider petitioner to have provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate the exercise of such political influence or authority.\n\n(Sec. 6) Requires the Assistant Secretary to establish the Independent Review and Advisory Board to: (1) assist in addressing unique evidentiary questions; (2) provide secondary peer review; and (3) enhance the credibility of the acknowledgment process.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to provide a petitioner or interested party a grant based on need to offset the cost incurred in submitting a petition or a legal argument in support of or in opposition to a petition.\n\nRequires the Assistant Secretary to establish a Federal acknowledgment research pilot project to make available additional research resources for researching, reviewing, and analyzing petitions for acknowledgment. Permits the Assistant Secretary to provide grants to assist approved institutions in participating in the pilot project.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2006.\n\n(Sec. 7) Declares that the Freedom of Information Act shall not apply to any action of the Assistant Secretary with respect to a petition for acknowledgment under this Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to request assistance from the Attorney General in responding to requests for petition-related information made in accordance with such Act.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2008.\n\n(Sec. 8) Declares that the acknowledgment of any petitioner under this Act shall not reduce or eliminate: (1) the right of any other Indian tribe to govern the reservation of that other tribe (as the reservation exists before, on, or after the date of acknowledgment of the petitioner); (2) any property right held in trust or recognized by the United States for the other Indian tribe (as it existed before the date of acknowledgment); or (3) any previously or independently existing claim by a petitioner to any such property right held in trust by the United States for the other Indian tribe before the date of acknowledgment.\n\nStates that, on acknowledgment by the Assistant Secretary of a petitioner under this Act, the newly-acknowledged Indian tribe shall: (1) have a government-to-government relationship with the United States; (2) be eligible for the programs and services provided by the United States to members of other Indian tribes because of their status as Indians; and (3) have the responsibilities, obligations, privileges, and immunities of those other Indian tribes.\n\nDeclares that the Assistant Secretary's acknowledgment of an Indian group, however, shall not establish any immediate entitlement to participation in any program of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in existence as of the date of acknowledgment.\n\nRequires officials of the BIA and the Indian Health Service to consult with each newly-acknowledged Indian tribe to determine its needs and to recommend a budget required to serve it."
