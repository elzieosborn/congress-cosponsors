Entitles the spouses and children of such victims to naturalization as U.S. citizens upon being administered the oath of renunciation and allegiance in an appropriate ceremony pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), without regard to their current status, if they apply to the Secretary of Homeland Security for naturalization within two years. Directs the Secretary to record the date of naturalization of any such person as being September 10, 2001. Prohibits naturalization of, or affording honorary citizenship to, any alien (or family member) who is inadmissible or deportable under the INA, including any perpetrator of such attacks."
