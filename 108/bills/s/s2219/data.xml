  <summary date="2004-04-26T17:54:57Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Motherhood Protection Act - Amends the Federal criminal code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice UCMJ to provide that anyone who engages in conduct that violates any of specified prohibitions under the Federal criminal code, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or the UCMJ and thereby causes the termination of a pregnancy or the interruption of the normal course of pregnancy is guilty of a separate offense. Makes the punishment for that offense the same as that provided for such conduct had that injury or death occurred to the pregnant woman.

Provides that an offense under this Act does not require proof that: (1) the person engaging in the conduct had, or should have had, knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or (2) the defendant intended to cause the termination or interruption of the pregnancy.

Prohibits prosecution: (1) for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman has been obtained or is implied by law in a medical emergency; (2) for conduct relating to the pregnant woman's medical treatment or matters related to the pregnancy; or (3) of any woman regarding her pregnancy.</summary>
