  <summary date="2005-03-02T16:22:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Canadian Waste Import Ban Act of 2003 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the importation into any State, and acceptance by a solid waste management facility, of Canadian municipal solid waste for disposal or incineration until the date on which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates regulations to implement and enforce the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste between the United States and Canada.

Authorizes State Governors to opt out of such prohibition pending promulgation of regulations if notice is submitted to the Administrator.

Requires the Administrator to: (1) perform the functions of the Designated Authority of the United States described in the Agreement with respect to the importation and exportation of municipal solid waste; and (2) implement and enforce the Agreement.

Directs the Administrator, when making importation decisions under the Agreement, to obtain the consent of each State and to consider the impact of importation on homeland security, public health, and the environment.</summary>
