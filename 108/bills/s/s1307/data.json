    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on March 29, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\n Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), directly or through financial assistance to non-Federal parties, to plan, design, and construct fish passage and screening facilities or habitat improvements at any non-Federal water diversion or storage project located anywhere in the Columbia River Basin. Provides such authority when the Secretary determines that such facilities would enable Reclamation to meet its obligations under specified Federal law regarding the construction and continued operation and maintenance of all Federal reclamation projects located in the Columbia River Basin, excluding the Federal reclamation projects located in the Snake River Basin. Limits the Federal share to 75 percent of project costs, requiring the non-Federal party to pay the remaining share. Sets forth other limitations and requirements relating to the authority under this Act.\n\nMakes the Reclamation Act of 1902 and other Federal reclamation laws inapplicable to the non-Federal water projects at which the fish passage and screening facilities authorized by this Act are located, and to the lands which such projects irrigate. Declares that expenditures made by the Secretary under this Act shall not be a project cost assignable to any Federal reclamation project and shall be non-reimbursable and non-returnable to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations."
