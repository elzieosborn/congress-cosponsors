    "text": "First Responders Partnership Grant Act of 2003 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to make grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes to support public safety officers in protecting homeland security and responding to acts of terrorism. Allows such grants to be used to fund overtime expenses, equipment, training, and facilities for such officers. Requires the Secretary to reserve one percent of grant funds for Indian tribes, and five percent for rural States. Provides for the allocation of remaining grant funds, with special consideration for proximity to: (1) areas with potential chemical security risks; (2) international borders; (3) nuclear power plants; (4) port security; and (5) disaster medical assistance teams.Provides maximum grantee amounts of: (1) five percent of total grant funds for a qualifying State, local government, or Indian tribe; and (2) 20 percent of such total for a State together with any grantees within the State.Prohibits grant funds from exceeding 90 percent of a program's cost, but authorizes the Secretary to waive the matching funds requirement in the case of grantee fiscal hardship."
