    "text": "Secure and Verifiable Electronic Voting Act of 2004 or SAVE Voting Act of 2004 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require Federal voting systems to produce a voter-verified paper record suitable for a manual audit, except that such a system should be paperless for individuals with disabilities. Specifies requirements for software used in voting systems. Requires information on the right to voter assistance to be given to those who are blind, disabled, or unable to read or write. Requires the Election Assistance Commission to: (1) provide States with funding to implement such voting systems; and (2) study, test, and develop best practices to enhance accessibility and voter-verification mechanisms for disabled voters.\n\nExtends the deadline for States to request payments for activities to improve administration of elections and for replacement of punch card or lever voting machines.\n\nAccelerates the deadline for compliance with voting systems standards from January 1, 2006, to the regularly scheduled November 2004 general Federal election. Requires each State and jurisdiction unable to meet such deadline to utilize a paper voting system at Commission expense in the November 2004 general election.\n\nRequires Federal certification of technological security of voter registration lists.\n\nDirects the Commission to: (1) conduct manual mandatory unannounced recounts of the voter-verified records in a specified number of State and overseas jurisdictions immediately following each general election for Federal office; and (2) promptly publish the results of those recounts.\n\nRequires manufacturers of voting systems to implement safeguards for software, including background checks of personnel, certification, and public access to the software code.\n\nRepeals the exemption of the Commission from certain Government contracting requirements."
