Limits noneconomic damages to $250,000. Makes each party liable only for the amount of damages directly proportional to such party's percentage of responsibility.\n\nAllows the court to restrict the payment of attorney contingency fees. Limits the fees to a percentage based on the amount awarded.\n\nPrescribes qualifications for expert witnesses.\n\nPermits the court to reduce damages received by the amount of collateral source benefits to which a claimant is entitled.\n\nAuthorizes the award of punitive damages only where: (1) it is proven that a person acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury the claimant was substantially certain to suffer; and (2) compensatory damages are awarded. Limits punitive damages to the greater of two times the amount of economic damages or $250,000.\n\nLimits the liability of manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, marketers, promoters, sellers, and providers of obstetrical, gynecological, emergency, or trauma care services products that comply with Food and Drug Administration standards.\n\n Provides for periodic payments of future damage awards."
