Provides a matching funds requirement.Prohibits an institution that receives assistance exceeding $2.5 million from receiving further assistance until every other eligible institution has received assistance under this Act.Requires each institution receiving such assistance to report annually to the Director on its use of such assistance. Requires the Director to review such reports, evaluate such assistance program, and report recommendations to Congress, including recommendations on the continuing need for Federal support of the program.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2008."
