  <summary date="2004-11-10T16:30:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Getting Results for Advanced Degrees Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize provisions relating to graduate student assistance.

Extends and increases the authorization of appropriations for: (1) Jacob K. Javits Fellowships (Javits Fellows); and (2) graduate assistance in areas of national need. Sets the amount of a stipend under both such programs at the same level as the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, without regard to financial need. Revises Board membership requirements under the Javits Fellows program.

Establishes, and authorizes appropriations for, the Patsy T. Mink Fellowship program of awards to assist highly qualified minorities and women to acquire the doctoral degree, or highest possible degree available, in academic areas in which such individuals are underrepresented, to enable them to enter the higher education professoriate.

Revises family contribution calculations for independent students with, and those without, dependents other than spouses. Allows a greater income protection allowance for such students.

Revises cost of attendance calculations for students with one or more dependents to include actual living expenses incurred for dependents, which includes their room, board and health insurance as well as dependent care.

Increases unsubsidized Stafford loan limits for graduate and professional students.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat reasonable room, board, and special needs services allowances as part of permitted higher education expenses, in cases of qualified scholarships or of tuition reduction programs for teaching and research assistants.</summary>
