Prohibits entry of a final removal order against such aliens during the pendency of State court child support proceedings.\n\nAdds nonpayment of child support to the INA's list of conduct barring a finding that an alien is a person of good moral character unless support payments are satisfied or the alien is in compliance with an approved payment agreement.\n\nAuthorizes immigration officers to serve process in child support or paternity cases on aliens seeking admission.\n\nAmends the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon request by the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, or Secretary of State, to provide authorized persons with information that may aid alien child support delinquency determinations. Prohibits the further disclosure of such information other than for Federal law enforcement purposes. Authorizes disciplinary action and civil penalties for unauthorized disclosures."
