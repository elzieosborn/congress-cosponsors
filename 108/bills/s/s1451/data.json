The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)\n\nRunaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act - Amends the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) and the Missing Children's Assistance Act (MCAA) to reauthorize and revise programs under such Acts.\n\nTitle I: Amendments to Runaway and Homeless Youth Act - (Sec. 102) Renames RHYA part A as the Basic Center Grant Program (currently Runaway and Homeless Youth Grant Program).(Sec. 103) Includes testing for sexually transmitted diseases, at the request of runaway and homeless youth, among the services which local basic centers may provide.(Sec. 106) Provides for an exception to a 20-youth-maximum-capacity requirement for funding a basic center, or a locally controlled temporary shelter, if the applicant assures that there is a State or local law or regulation that requires a higher maximum to comply with licensure requirements for children and youth serving facilities. (Sec. 107) Includes maternity group homes among the types of transitional living youth projects eligible for grants under part B (Transitional Living Grant Program) of RHYA. (Sec. 108) Extends an individual youth's eligibility to remain in a transitional shelter beyond the regular 540-day period until the earlier of the youth's 18th birthday or the 180th day after the end of the 540-day period.
