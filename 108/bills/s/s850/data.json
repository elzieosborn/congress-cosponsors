Permits, and sets forth criteria for, an election to treat all members of a family as one shareholder.Permits the issuance of qualified preferred stock, which shall not be treated as second class stock. Makes any distribution (not in payment in exchange for stock) made by an S corporation with respect to qualified preferred stock includible as ordinary income of the holder and deductible to the corporation as an expense.Revises exceptions to the criteria for the treatment of certain wholly owned subchapter S subsidiaries with reference to required information returns.Provides for a charitable contribution basis adjustment of S corporation stock based upon the shareholder's pro rata share of adjusted basis."
