  <summary date="2004-12-13T22:00:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">National Reforestation Act of 2004 - Increases, from $30 to $90 million, the amount that can be transferred to the Reforestation Trust Fund by the Secretary of the Treasury in any fiscal year.

Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to obligate sums in the Trust Fund for reforestation treatment to restore appropriate forest cover on forest land derived from the public domain that is capable of growing trees and that is a moderate fire intensity area or high fire intensity area or that has been severely affected by a nonfire natural disturbance event if the need for the treatment is identified in a specified report on herbicides and pesticides and the treatment occurs within five years of: (1) if there is no harvest activity following the wildfire or the nonfire natural disturbance event, a wildfire or a nonfire natural disturbance event; (2) if a regeneration harvest is the final cut in a stand in a disturbed area, the regeneration harvest; or (3) if a salvage harvest is the final cut in a stand in a disturbed area, the salvage harvest.

Allows the Secretary of Agriculture, in addition to amounts authorized from the Trust Fund, to obligate up to ten percent of the sums the Secretary expends annually from the Trust Fund to supplement expenditures of the Forest Service to enter into cooperative agreements with colleges and universities to conduct research to promote or enhance reforestation.</summary>
