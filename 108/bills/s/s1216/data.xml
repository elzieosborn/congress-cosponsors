Mandates subsequent implementation of such requirement with respect to all other metropolitan statistical areas in which three or more providers provide wireless service.

Directs the FCC to require providers to include specified information in their wireless telephone service plans, including charges, minutes allowed, contract length, start-up fees, and taxes and surcharges.

Requires each provider to make available, including on the Internet, a map of their service area.

Directs the FCC to monitor the quality of wireless service through semiannual provider reports.

Empowers the FCC to, and the States to bring civil actions in U.S. district court to, enforce provisions of this Act.</summary>
