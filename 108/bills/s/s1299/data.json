Sets forth: (1) criteria for making that determination; and (2) priorities in making grants, with preference to rural communities.\n\nRepeals the continued dumping and subsidy offset program (under which sums are distributed to affected domestic producers).\n\nEstablishes the Community Trade Readjustment and Development Enhancement Trust Fund, which shall be available for the payment of readjustment assistance to communities."
