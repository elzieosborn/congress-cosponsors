Requires collected amounts to be paid to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that nothing in this Act should: (1) cause a net decrease in total Federal funding for childhood drinking prevention and education below the level that would otherwise have been received but for this Act's enactment; or (2) affect first class or other regular postage rates.\n\nRequires the special postage stamps to be made available to the public."
