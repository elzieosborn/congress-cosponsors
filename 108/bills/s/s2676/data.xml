  <summary date="2004-10-26T19:16:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends Federal law to require the Postal Service to establish a special rate of postage (a special postage stamp) for first class mail that is up to 25 percent higher than the regular rate as a voluntary alternative that the public may use to contribute to funding for childhood drinking prevention and education. Requires collected amounts to be paid to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Expresses the sense of Congress that nothing in this Act should: (1) cause a net decrease in total Federal funding for childhood drinking prevention and education below the level that would otherwise have been received but for this Act's enactment; or (2) affect first class or other regular postage rates.

Requires the special postage stamps to be made available to the public.</summary>
