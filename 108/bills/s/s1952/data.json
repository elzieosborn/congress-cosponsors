Directs the U.S. Trade Representative, unless certifying to Congress within 30 days after the enactment of this Act that Mexico has eliminated such tax and is otherwise preserving all U.S. trade agreement rights with respect to high fructose corn syrup, to either: (1) suspend, withdraw, or prevent the application of benefits of trade agreement concessions to carry out a trade agreement with Mexico; or (2) impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods of Mexico, and fees or restrictions on the services of Mexico."
