Requires annual reports by the Administrator to such congressional committees on progress within NOAA of the transition of research results into operational products and services.\n\n(Sec. 203) Amends the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 to authorize the Administrator to establish a volunteer program for hydrographic services improvement, by entering into special agreements with qualified organizations and providing funding to such organizations to implement such program. Requires a qualified organization to be non-governmental, not-for-profit, and determined to have demonstrated expertise in boating safety and a commitment to improving the quality of hydrographic services and related oceanographic and meteorological information.\n\n(Sec. 204) Requires the Administrator to establish within NOAA an Office of Education and to consider education a central part of NOAA's mission. Requires such Office to coordinate and promote educational missions for all NOAA programs to better facilitate public awareness of oceanic and atmospheric systems. Authorizes appropriations for activities of such Office for FY 2004 through 2008.\n\n(Sec. 205) Amends the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Act of 2002 to increase the maximum number of NOAA Corps officers.\n\n(Sec. 206) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) operate the NOAA marine lab as a partnership for collaborative, interdisciplinary marine scientific research; (2) charge fees and form agreements with Federal, State, and private entities; and (3) use such funds to support lab research, operations, and enhancement.\n\nPermits the members of the lab partnership to: (1) use Federal, State, private, and grant funds to further the mission of the lab; (2) seek and hold patents and share personnel, facilities, and property; (3) use any collected or accepted funds of any partner to cover costs, reimburse participating agencies for their costs, and fund research and facilities expansion; and (4) use lab funds to operate partners' labs.\n\n(Sec. 207) Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense (Secretaries) to review management plans for continued tropical cyclone surveillance and reconnaissance development to determine: (1) if the plans provide adequate coverage and protection of citizens in coastal areas; (2) appropriate roles and responsibilities for the Departments of Commerce and Defense; and (3) any additional funding or other resources necessary for these plans. Requires submission of review findings to Congress within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Prohibits NOAA from accepting any responsibility for the duties of the U.S. Air Force Reserve 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron until 30 days after the Secretaries provide Congress with a plan for NOAA and Air Force Reserve mission performance and aircraft use.\n\n(Sec. 208) Authorizes the Secretary to conduct studies on the placement of NEXRAD radar facilities in areas that are not currently covered by this radar (many of which are in the western United States). Requires such studies to identify possible facility placement locations to optimize the coverage of currently uncovered areas."
