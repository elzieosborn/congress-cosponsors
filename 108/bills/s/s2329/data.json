    "text": "Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that a crime victim has the following rights: (1) to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to not be excluded from, any public proceeding involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused; (3) to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding involving release, plea, or sentencing; (4) to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case; (5) to full and timely restitution as provided in law; (6) to proceedings free from unreasonable delay; and (7) to be treated with fairness and with respect for his or her dignity and privacy. Directs the court to ensure that a victim is afforded these rights in any proceeding involving the offense and to clearly state on the record the reasons for any decision denying relief under this Act.\n\nRequires officers and employees of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other departments and agencies engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime to make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, these rights. Requires the prosecutor to advise a crime victim of any material conflict of interest between the prosecutor and the victim, and to take reasonable steps to direct the victim to the appropriate legal referral, legal assistance, or legal aid agency. Provides that notice of release otherwise required under this Act shall not be given if it may endanger the safety of any person.\n\nAuthorizes the crime victim, the victim's lawful representative, and the Government attorney to assert the rights established under this Act.
