Revises provisions relating to caseworker visits, health and education records, notice of proceedings, and use of interjurisdictional resources.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to study State performance of background checks for child placements.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that States should: (1) revise the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children; and (2) use private agencies to conduct home studies and give full faith and credit to other States' home study reports."
