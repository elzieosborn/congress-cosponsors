  <summary date="2003-09-15T18:17:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Identity Theft Victims Assistance Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to require a business entity that possesses information regarding an alleged identity theft, after receipt of a written request by the victim, to provide a free copy of all application and business information related to the transaction to: (1) the victim; (2) any Federal, State, or local governing law enforcement agency or officer specified by the victim; or (3) any law enforcement agency investigating the identity theft and authorized by the victim to receive records. Requires the victim to provide to a business entity that is otherwise unable to to verify the victim's identity specified proof of the victim's identity (such as the presentation of a government-issued identification card) and claim of identity theft (such as a copy of a police report or a properly completed copy of a standardized affidavit developed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)). Immunizes the business entity for such good faith disclosures.

Authorizes the U.S. Attorney General and State attorneys general to bring civil actions to enforce this Act. Deems a violation of this Act to be an unfair or deceptive act or practice subject to enforcement by the FTC (with specified exceptions).

Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require a consumer reporting agency to: (1) block the reporting of information identified by the consumer in his or her file resulting from identity theft; (2) reinvestigate such information; and (3) notify the consumer if the block is declined or rescinded. Prescribes penalties for falsely claiming to be a victim of identity theft.

Provides for a five-year statute of limitations for actions against credit reporting agencies to enforce liabilities from misrepresentations with respect to identity theft victims.

Amends the Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 to include the FTC Chairman, Postmaster General, and U.S. Customs Service Commissioner on the Coordinating Committee on False Identification and to modify reporting requirements.</summary>
