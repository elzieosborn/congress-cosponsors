Authorizes the ranking minority party member of a committee, if the chair fails to introduce the bill within the 30-day period, to introduce a bill that will qualify for the expedited procedure provided in this Act.\n\nQualifies a bill if: (1) its title reads \"to reform the system of the United States and to provide insurance coverage for all Americans;\" and (2) it reaches the goal of providing health care coverage to 95 percent of Americans within ten years.\n\nSets forth procedures for consideration of such legislation in both chambers."
