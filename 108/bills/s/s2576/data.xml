  <summary date="2004-10-22T14:40:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Health Care Reform Expedited Procedures Act of 2004 - Requires, within 30 calendar days after the commencement of the first session of a Congress, the chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the chairs of the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and on Ways and Means, and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the House each to introduce a bill to provide universal health care coverage for the people of the United States.

States that these bills may be introduced by request, but only one qualified bill may be introduced by each such individual within a Congress. Authorizes the ranking minority party member of a committee, if the chair fails to introduce the bill within the 30-day period, to introduce a bill that will qualify for the expedited procedure provided in this Act.

Qualifies a bill if: (1) its title reads "to reform the system of the United States and to provide insurance coverage for all Americans;" and (2) it reaches the goal of providing health care coverage to 95 percent of Americans within ten years.

Sets forth procedures for consideration of such legislation in both chambers.</summary>
