  <summary date="2004-04-02T20:33:58Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the addition of India as a country for which the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally has responsibilities should not decrease funding to any other country; (2) the United States should continue to increase the number of countries eligible to receive U.S. assistance to combat HIV and AIDS; and (3) the United States should increase assistance to combat HIV and AIDS.

Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to include India among those countries for which the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally has program responsibilities.</summary>
