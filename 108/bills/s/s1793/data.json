Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 through FY 2009 for: (1) the current program of part A grants to HSIs that offer baccalaureate degrees or are junior or community colleges; and (2) the new part B grants to HSIs that offer postbaccalaureate certifications or degrees. Eliminates the requirement that an eligible HSI provide assurances that at least 50 percent of its Hispanic students be low-income students.
