Directs the Secretary to convene a college cost summit with representatives of competing peer IHEs to negotiate voluntarily agreed upon limits on future college tuition and fee increases (which require the Secretary's approval, and to which antitrust laws shall not apply).

Requires a certain maintenance of effort by States in supporting public IHEs, upon penalty of lowering of Federal assistance levels for Pell Grant and student loan programs at such IHEs.

Requires IHEs that receive Federal funds and are eligible for assistance under HEA title IV (Student Assistance) to include certain truth-in-tuition disclosures in their admissions applications.

Revises provisions and reauthorizes appropriations for HEA title II (Teacher Quality Enhancement): (1) teacher quality enhancement grants for States and partnerships; and (2) preparing tomorrow's teachers to use technology. Establishes a new program for innovative strategies to recruit, train, and retain high quality teachers and principals.

Establishes a HEA program for college admissions test preparation for low-income students.

Revises HEA title IV to require IHEs to: (1) include in student aid applications certain information on admissions and retention for prospective students; and (2) provide certain support services to increase student retention. Directs the Secretary to make: (1) competitive grants, to IHEs where at least 40 percent of students are eligible for Pell Grants, to increase student retention and promote articulation agreements; and (2) supplemental grants, to States in partnership with IHEs and other entities, for certain access and persistence activities relating to low-income students.

Establishes a program of competitive grants to eligible HSIs that offer postbaccalaureate certifications or degrees (part B grants). Limits a part B grant award's duration to five years. Prohibits the Secretary of Education from awarding more than one part B grant to an HSI in any one fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 through FY 2009 for: (1) the current program of part A grants to HSIs that offer baccalaureate degrees or are junior or community colleges; and (2) the new part B grants to HSIs that offer postbaccalaureate certifications or degrees. Eliminates the requirement that an eligible HSI provide assurances that at least 50 percent of its Hispanic students be low-income students. Includes, among authorized activities under part A grants, articulation agreements and student support programs to help transfers from two-year to four-year institutions. Eliminates the two-year wait-out period between any two five-year part A grants to an HSI.
