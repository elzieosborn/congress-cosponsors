Sets forth a reallocation scheme for unappropriated balances with respect to: (1) the rural abandoned mine reclamation program; (2) the Federal share; and (3) historic production supplemental grants to States and Indian tribes.

Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to transfer from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund (Combined Fund) an amount equal to specified expenditures that the Combined Fund trustees estimate will be debited against a certain unassigned beneficiaries premium account.

Creates a schedule for the payment of reclamation fees for FY 2004 through 2018 by operators of coal mining operations.

Sets forth guidelines governing: (1) allocation of fee receipts and other monies prior to September 30, 2004; and (2) allocation of funds to States and Indian Tribes after September 30, 2004.

States that surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for remining shall not affect the eligibility of such lands for reclamation and restoration after the release of the bond or deposit for any such operation.

Revises requirements for the granting of Federal funds to implement an approved State reclamation program.

Authorizes regulations requiring State assumption of responsibility for administering the emergency reclamation program in order to retain eligibility for Federal grants.

Revises requirements for State or Indian tribe certification of the completion of coal reclamation.

Authorizes the Secretary to adopt regulations to promote remining of eligible lands to leverage use of monies available from the fund to achieve more land reclamation.</summary>
