Authorizes the Secretary to award a grant to an eligible community to: (1) develop and implement such plan; and (2) upon its approval, carry out any project or program included in the plan. Provides for award of supplemental grants\n\nRequires the Secretary to develop guidelines to ensure that rural communities receive preference in the allocation of resources.\n\nEstablishes an Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance in the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for the National Institute of Standards and Technology for: (1) the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program through FY 2015; and (2) the Advanced Technology Program through FY 2013.\n\nEstablishes an Office of Small Business in the Office of the United States Trade Representative."
