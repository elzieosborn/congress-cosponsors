Prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against such individuals.\n\nAllows the Secretary, upon determining that measures taken under this Act have not been effective, to: (1) take additional measures necessary to protect the public health; and (2) require manufacturers or anyone in possession of the vaccine to sell their supply to the Federal Government."
