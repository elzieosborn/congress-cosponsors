Chimayo Water Supply System and Espanola Filtration Facility Act of 2004 - Title I: Chimayo Water Supply System - (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the feasibility of constructing a water supply system that includes potable water transmission lines, pump stations, and storage reservoirs for the town of Chimayo, New Mexico, in the Santa Cruz River Valley in the eastern margin of the Espanola Basin (study area). Requires the Secretary to determine the total life cycle costs of the system and to consider: (1) operating the system in connection with the Espanola Water Filtration Facility; (2) various water sources for the Town; (3) reusing or recycling water from local or regional sources; and (4) using alternative water supplies. Sets the Federal share of the cost of the study at 75 percent.

Directs the Secretary to coordinate activities of the Bureau of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the United States Geological Survey in furtherance of the study, including accessing BLM land adjacent to the study area and drilling exploratory wells on such land that are necessary to determine water resources available for the town.

(Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with water authorities in the study area to provide emergency water supply development assistance to any eligible person or entity, including for hauling water, installing water purification technology at community wells or individual point-of-use, drilling wells, installing pump stations and storage reservoirs, installing transmission and distribution pipelines to bring water to individual residential service connections, and the engineering, design, and installation of an emergency water supply system. Sets the Federal share of the cost of any such activity at 75 percent.

(Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations, with a limitation on the use of funds for the construction of water infrastructure for the system.

Title II: Espanola Water Filtration Facility - (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to provide financial assistance to the city of Espanola, New Mexico, for the construction of an Espanola water filtration facility to: (1) divert and fully use imported water to meet future demands in the region; and (2) use reclaimed water to enhance groundwater resources and surface water supplies. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to the Santa Clara and San Juan Pueblos and non-Federal sponsors for the study, planning, design, and construction of a water delivery resource and infrastructure development as a component of the facility. Limits the Federal share of the cost of the facility or component to 25 percent. Prohibits the use of funds for the operation or maintenance of the facility or the component.

(Sec. 203) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
