Requires such period to be considered as an opportunity for a moment of silent reflection on the anticipated activities of the day.Declares that this Act shall not be construed as prohibiting or restricting constitutionally protected prayer.Requires LEAs, as a condition of receiving ESEA funds, to certify in writing to their State that they are in compliance with this Act."
