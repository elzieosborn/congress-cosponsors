Prescribes penalties to be imposed for: (1) obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by taking possession of, carrying away, or transferring, with intent to steal, any goods offered for retail sale with a total value of between $1,000 and $5,000, or of over $5,000, during any 180-day period; (2) receiving, possessing, concealing, storing, bartering, selling, disposing of, or traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to distribute, any property which the person knows, or should have known, has been taken or stolen in violation of this Act; and (3) knowingly promoting, managing, or facilitating such an offense. Provides enhanced penalties for assault, jeopardizing a person's life by use of a dangerous weapon, killing, or kidnapping committeed in the course of such an offense. Requires a person to forfeit any interest in goods acquired or maintained in violation of this Act.\n\nSets forth provisions concerning injunctions to restrain violations, impounding of goods, the forfeiture and disposition of goods, and civil remedies by persons aggrieved by violations of this Act.\n\nMakes commission of organized retail theft a predicate for a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nProhibits anyone at a flea market from selling, offering for sale, or knowingly permitting the sale of: (1) baby food, infant formula, or similar products uses as a sole or major source of nutrition, manufactured and packaged for sale for consumption primarily by children under age three; or (2) any drug, food for special dietary use, cosmetic, or device, except by an authorized representative of the product manufacturer or distributor.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to report on Department of Justice actions involving organized retail theft."
