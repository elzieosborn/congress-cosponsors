Describes the Secretary's duties, including conducting studies, providing technical assistance, and submitting annual reports.\n\n(Sec. 4) Specifies the criteria that the Secretary shall apply to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating proposed Areas. States that designation of an Area shall be: (1) by Act of Congress; and (2) contingent on the prior completion of a study and an affirmative determination by the Secretary that the area meets such criteria.\n\n(Sec. 5) Sets forth requirements for Area management plans. Instructs local coordinating entities to submit plans to the Secretary for approval. Prohibits a local coordinating entity from using Federal funds authorized by this Act to implement an amendment until the Secretary approves the amendment.\n\n(Sec. 6) Requires such an entity to submit annual reports to the Secretary for each fiscal year for which the local coordinating committee receives Federal funds under this Act.\n\nBars local coordinating entities from using Federal funds authorized under this Act to acquire any interest in real property.\n\n(Sec. 7) Specifies this Act's effect with regard to: (1) the provision of technical or financial assistance by other Federal agencies; (2) the management or use of Federal land by other Federal agencies; and (3) specified private property and regulatory protections.\n\n(Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations.\n\nTerminates the authority of the Secretary to provide financial assistance to an individual local coordinating entity (excluding technical assistance and administrative oversight) 15 years after the initial receipt of the assistance by the local coordinating committee.\n\nLimits to five percent the amount of funds that may be used by the Secretary for technical assistance, oversight, and administration.\n\nRequires grant recipients to provide, as a condition of receiving a grant under this Act, matching funds from non-Federal sources equal to the grant amount."
