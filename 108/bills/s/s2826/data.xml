Authorizes the CFO, after such recalculation, to transfer funds: (1) between the reserve funds to reach the required percentages; and (2) from them to the General Fund of the District to the extent that such funds are not necessary to meet their established requirements. Bases cash reserve requirements for both funds upon prior year actual expenditures, rather than the proposed expenditures of the current budget year. Extends the replenishment requirement from one year to two years. Prohibits the CFO from transferring funds from the emergency or the contingency reserve funds to the extent that such a transfer would lower the FY 2005 total percentage below seven percent.

(Sec. 339) Amends the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2001 to authorize a recipient (eligible nonprofit corporation) of a grant from the Credit Enhancement Fund for Public Charter Schools in the District to use such funds to carry out activities to assist D.C. public charter schools in establishing regulations for administering lease guarantees to such schools through the credit enhancement fund.

Amends the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2003 to place the Office of Public Charter School Financing and Support under the Mayor's authority in lieu of the Department of Banking and Financial Institutions.

(Sec. 340) Amends the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995 to declare that a petition to establish a public charter school in the District or to convert a District public school or an existing private or independent school into a public charter school, is a public document.

(Sec. 341) Reduces from two-thirds to 51percent the minimum number of full-time teachers employed in a school necessary to endorse a petition to convert a District public school or an existing private or independent school into a public charter school.

Grants a teacher employed at a D.C. public school that converts to a public charter school the option of remaining at the charter school during the school's first year of operation after receiving an extended leave of absence. Provides that, after this one-year period, the teacher may continue in such employment at the sole discretion of the public charter school, or shall maintain current status within the D.C. public school system.

Modifies the preference in leasing or purchasing former D.C. public school property for a public charter school to require the Mayor and the District government to give a right of first offer (currently, first preference) to be annually reinstated with respect to any facility or property not previously disposed of, or under contract to be disposed of, to an eligible applicant or Board of Trustees.

 Modifies the requirement of the Mayor's jurisdiction over such facility or property. Requires the Mayor to have jurisdiction on the effective date of this Act or the Mayor or any successor agency to gain jurisdiction after such date.

 Requires the purchase or lease to: (1) be negotiated by the Mayor; (2) include rent or an acquisition price, as applicable, that is at least 25 percent less than the appraised value of the property (based on use of the property for school purposes); and (3) include a lease period, if the property is to be leased, of not less than 25 years, renewable for additional 25-year periods as long as the eligible applicant or Board of Trustees maintains its charter.

Grants a D.C. public school approved to become a conversion public charter school the right to exclusively occupy the facilities the school occupied as a D.C. public school under a lease for a period of not less than 25 years, renewable for additional 25-year periods as long as the school maintains its charter at the non-profit rate, or if there is no non-profit rate, at 25 percent less than the fair market rate for school use.

(Sec. 342) Requires an eligible chartering authority to ensure that each public charter school complies with annual reporting requirements, including submission of the audited financial statement.

Requires the annual report of each eligible chartering authority that issues a charter to include: (1) details of major Board actions; (2) major findings from school reviews of academic, financial, and compliance with health and safety standards and resulting Board action or recommendations; (3) details of the fifth year review process and outcomes; and (4) a summary of annual financial audits of all charter schools, including the number of schools that failed to timely submit the required audited financial statement, those whose audits revealed a failure to follow required accounting practices or other material deficiencies and steps taken by the authority to rectify such deficiencies, and the ones which have required intervention by an authorizing board to address any academic or operational issue and what recommendations the board has made to correct identified deficiencies.

(Sec. 343) Requires the Secretary of the Interior to lease to the District government for public recreational use, without consideration and for a 50-year period, specified National Park Service land in Anacostia Park, and the Kenilworth Parkside Community Center (under the District's jurisdiction).

Provides that nothing in the Act precludes the District of Columbia from entering into a sublease for all or part of the property with a public not-for-profit entity for the management or maintenance of the property.

(Sec. 344) Requires the Comptroller General to conduct biennial management evaluations of the District of Columbia Chartering Authorities for the District of Columbia Public Charter Schools. Specifies the contents of such evaluations.

Requires the Government Accountability Office, by May 1, 2005, to submit to congressional appropriations committees a baseline report on the performance of each authorizer in meeting the requirements of the School Reform Act of 1995.
