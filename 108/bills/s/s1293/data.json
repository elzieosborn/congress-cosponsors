Prohibits conspiring to do so.\n\nSets criminal and civil penalties for violations, including forfeiture to the United States of a violator's: (1) real or personal property constituting or traceable to gross profits or other proceeds obtained from such offense; and (2) equipment, software, or other technology used or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the commission of the offense.\n\nDirects the United States Sentencing Commission to review and amend the sentencing guidelines and policy statements and consider providing sentencing enhancements for violations of this Act for convicted persons who: (1) obtained e-mail addresses through improper means, including by harvesting e-mail addresses of the users of a website, proprietary service, or other online public forum operated by another person, without that person's authorization or by randomly generating e-mail addresses by computer; or (2) knew that the commercial e-mail messages involved in the offense contained or advertised an Internet domain for which the registrant of the domain had provided false registration information.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires the Departments of Justice and State to report on efforts to achieve international cooperation in investigating and prosecuting spammers who engage in conduct that violates this Act. Calls for such Departments to work through international fora for such cooperation."
