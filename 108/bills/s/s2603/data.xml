Requires: (1) an affected boxing commission, upon request, to be furnished copies of all such information; and (2) the protection of the confidentiality of all broadcaster information provided.

(Sec. 215) Prohibits a promoter from arranging a championship match or a match scheduled for ten rounds or more unless all participating judges and referees have been licensed by the USBC. Allows a sanctioning organization to provide a list of judges and referees deemed qualified, but requires the boxing commission to select, license, and appoint the participating judges and referees.

Title IV: Exemption from Infringement for Skipping Audio and Video Content In Motion Pictures - Family Movie Act of 2004 - (Sec. 402) Amends Federal copyright law to create an exemption from copyright infringement for: (1) the making imperceptible, by or at the direction of a private household, of limited portions of audio or video content of a motion picture during a performance in or transmitted to that household for private home viewing from an authorized copy of the motion picture; or (2) the creation or provision of technology that enables such editing, is designed and marketed for such use, creates no fixed copy of the altered version, and makes no changes, deletions or additions to commercial advertisements or promotional announcements that would otherwise be performed or displayed.

Allows only the copyright owner or an authorized licensee of the copyright owner to place the seal on any film or other approved copy of the Registry version of a film selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry in the case of mass distributed, broadcast, or published works.

Directs the Librarian to utilize the National Audiovisual Conservation Center to ensure that preserved films included in the Registry are stored in a proper manner, and disseminated to researchers, scholars, and the public as may be appropriate in accordance with U.S. copyright law and the terms of any agreements between the Librarian and persons who hold copyrights to such audiovisual works.

Title VIII: Anticounterfeiting Provisions and Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions - Subtitle A: Anticounterfeiting Provisions - Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004 - (Sec. 802) Rewrites Federal criminal code provisions regarding trafficking in counterfeit labels. Prohibits knowingly trafficking in: (1) a counterfeit label affixed to, enclosing, or accompanying (currently, affixed to) a phonorecord, a copy of a computer program, a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, or documentation or packaging; or (2) counterfeit documentation or packaging. Expands the definition of "counterfeit label" to include a genuine label that is: (1) distributed for a product for which it was not intended, without authorization of the copyright owner; or (2) altered to falsify the number of authorized copies, the authorized user, or the edition of the program.

Authorizes the court, when a person is convicted of violating this Act, to order the forfeiture and destruction or other disposition of any equipment, device, or material used to manufacture, reproduce, or assemble the counterfeit labels.

Sets forth provisions regarding subsequent violations and limitation on actions.

Subtitle B: Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions - Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act - (Sec. 812) Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 and Federal copyright law to make it a violation of trademark and copyright law if a person knowingly provided, or caused to be provided, materially false contact information in making, maintaining, or renewing the registration of a domain name used in connection with the violation.
