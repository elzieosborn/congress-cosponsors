    "text": "Ready to Educate All Children Act of 2003 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to establish partnerships with high poverty local educational agencies or high poverty schools (local partners) to establish or enhance a clinically-based elementary or secondary school teacher training program.Requires an IHE receiving such a grant to: (1) establish a partnership with a local partner to establish or enhance such a program; (2) facilitate a partnership among the IHE's departments to ensure that future teachers are prepared to teach; and (3) implement a project-based assessment. Requires such IHE also to use grant funds for at least three activities listed.Makes a student who participates in a program funded under this Act eligible for student assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 during the student's fifth year of study for a teaching degree (if such clinically-based program is a teaching-degree study requirement)."
