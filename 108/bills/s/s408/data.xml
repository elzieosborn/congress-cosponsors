Requires such IHE also to use grant funds for at least three activities listed.Makes a student who participates in a program funded under this Act eligible for student assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 during the student's fifth year of study for a teaching degree (if such clinically-based program is a teaching-degree study requirement).</summary>
