Provides that the Center, in reliance upon stated fitness criteria and except upon proof of actual malice or intentional misconduct, shall not be liable in any civil action for damages: (1) arising from any act or communication by the Center that results in or contributes to a decision that an individual is unfit to serve as a volunteer for any volunteer organization; (2) alleging harm arising from a decision based on the information in an individual's criminal history record that an individual is fit to serve as a volunteer for any volunteer organization unless the Center is furnished with an individual's criminal history records which they know to be inaccurate or incomplete, or which they know reflect a lesser crime than that for which the individual was arrested; and (3) alleging harm arising from a decision that, based on the absence of criminal history information, an individual is fit to serve as a volunteer for any volunteer organization unless the Center knows that criminal history records exist and have not been furnished as required by the Act."
