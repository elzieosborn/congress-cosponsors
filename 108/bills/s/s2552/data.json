Sets the Federal share of project costs under local cooperation agreements at 75 percent.\n\nRequires a reduction in the non-Federal share of the cost of constructing projects under this Act, using a Federal formula for water rate affordability, where the rate for affordability relating to the project area exceeds the average State-wide rate by a specified percentage.\n\nSets the non-Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for projects constructed with assistance under this Act at 100 percent."
