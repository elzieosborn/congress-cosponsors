Establishes a National Security Service Board to: (1) develop criteria for awarding such Fellowships; (2) provide for the wide dissemination of information regarding assisted activities; (3) work with the Director in hiring and placing fellows in national security positions; and (4) develop and provide to Congress a strategic plan that identifies the skills needed by the Federal national security workforce. Requires 20 percent of such Fellowships to be set-aside for Federal employees who are working in such positions to enhance their education and training in areas important to national security.Creates a National Security Service Corps, under the direction of the Board, to provide rotational opportunities for mid-level employees in national security positions within and between specified agencies.Requires agencies' annual strategic and performance plans and program performance reports to evaluate the role of specific skills in accomplishing or failing to accomplish such agencies' goals."
