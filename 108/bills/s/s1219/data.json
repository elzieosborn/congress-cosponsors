Requires CC programs to: (1) engage school-age youth in meaningful service that meets unmet human, educational, environmental, or public safety needs; (2) provide substantial structured opportunities for them to reflect on their service activities; and (3) be integrated into and enhance the school's academic curriculum or educational components of an after-school or summer program. Gives priority in awarding grants to qualified entities that: (1) demonstrate they will engage school-age youth in high-quality service programs; and (2) propose to serve jurisdictions with high numbers or percentages of low-income families."
