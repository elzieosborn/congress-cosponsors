  <summary date="2003-08-27T16:14:16Z" status="Introduced in Senate">School Service Act of 2003 - Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 to establish a Community Corps (CC) for school-age youth.

Authorizes the Corporation for National and Community Service to make competitive grants, to cover a Federal share of the cost of planning or operating CC programs, to qualified entities, including States, Indian tribes, local educational agencies, or nonprofit organizations acting in partnership with one or more of such entities. Requires CC programs to: (1) engage school-age youth in meaningful service that meets unmet human, educational, environmental, or public safety needs; (2) provide substantial structured opportunities for them to reflect on their service activities; and (3) be integrated into and enhance the school's academic curriculum or educational components of an after-school or summer program. Gives priority in awarding grants to qualified entities that: (1) demonstrate they will engage school-age youth in high-quality service programs; and (2) propose to serve jurisdictions with high numbers or percentages of low-income families.</summary>
