  <summary date="2004-09-08T16:43:57Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)

Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) support efforts for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern and eastern Uganda; (2) work with the Government of Uganda and the international community to make available sufficient resources to meet the relief and development needs of the towns and cities that are supporting large numbers of displaced people; (3) urge the Government of Uganda and the international community to assume greater responsibility for the protection of civilians and economic development in regions in Uganda affected by the conflict; (4) urge the leaders and members of the Lord's Resistance Army to stop the abduction of children, and urge all armed forces in Uganda to stop the use of child soldiers, and seek the release of all individuals who have been abducted; (5) provide assistance to individuals who were abducted during the conflict, child soldiers, and other children affected by the conflict; (6) work with the Government of Uganda, other countries, and international organizations to ensure that sufficient resources and technical support are devoted to the demobilization and reintegration of rebel combatants and abductees; (7) urge the Government of Uganda to improve the professionalism of Ugandan military personnel currently stationed in northern and eastern Uganda, with an emphasis on respect for human rights and civilian protection; (8) work with the international community to assist and increase the capacity of Ugandan civil institutions to monitor the human rights situation in northern Uganda; (9) urge the Government of Uganda to permit international human rights monitors to establish a presence in northern and eastern Uganda; and (10) make clear that the relationship between Sudan and the United States cannot improve unless no credible evidence indicates that authorities of the Government of Sudan are providing support to the Lord's Resistance Army.

Directs the Secretary of State to submit a report on the conflict in Uganda which shall include information on: (1) individuals or entities that are providing support for the Lord's Resistance Army, including a description of any such support provided by the Government of Sudan or by senior officials of such Government; (2) activities of the Lord's Resistance Army that prohibit the provision of humanitarian assistance or the protection of the civilian population in Uganda; (3) practices employed by the Ugandan People's Defense Forces in northern and eastern Uganda to ensure that children and civilians are protected; and (4) actions carried out by the United States, Uganda, or the international community to protect displaced civilians, especially women and children.</summary>
