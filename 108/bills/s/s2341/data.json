Prohibits health care entities from retaliating against any employee who, in good faith, reports conduct that may be construed to violate a Federal or State law to a State authority, licensing authority, peer review organization, or employer.\n\nAmends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require States to implement a system to report criminal background information to the Data Bank."
