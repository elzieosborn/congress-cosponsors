Requires initiation of an investigation only if a satisfactory resolution of such practices has not been reached.\n\nModifies the composition of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to include a Chief Enforcement Negotiator to recommend investigating and prosecuting cases before the World Trade Organization and under trade agreements to which the United States is a party."
