Bars the Secretary from including terms that are more restrictive than those of the earlier lease.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary, at the concessionaire's request and subject to specified notice, to extend the lease for up to four additional ten-year periods. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) deadline extension and requirements (including with regard to meeting operating standards or regulations applicable to Reclamation concessions at the time, particularly concerning public safety); (2) subsequent transfer of ownership of concession facilities; (3) review by the Secretary if construction or improvement poses a significant hazard to public safety or the environment; (4) boundary expansion; and (5) erosion control.\n\nRequires 80 percent of the recreation fees collected at the Canyon Ferry Unit to be deposited in that Unit's recreation account."
