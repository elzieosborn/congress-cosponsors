  <summary date="2004-11-04T18:36:23Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Canyon Ferry Yacht Basin Marina Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to: (1) provide for the continued operation of the Yacht Basin Marina located on the Canyon Ferry Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program, Montana; or (2) maintain a marina at Yacht Basin that provides at least as many services and facilities as are available at the Marina on the date of this Act's enactment.

Extends the lease for a public concession in the Yacht Basin Concession Area for ten years, with an exception. Bars the Secretary from including terms that are more restrictive than those of the earlier lease.

Authorizes the Secretary, at the concessionaire's request and subject to specified notice, to extend the lease for up to four additional ten-year periods. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) deadline extension and requirements (including with regard to meeting operating standards or regulations applicable to Reclamation concessions at the time, particularly concerning public safety); (2) subsequent transfer of ownership of concession facilities; (3) review by the Secretary if construction or improvement poses a significant hazard to public safety or the environment; (4) boundary expansion; and (5) erosion control.

Requires 80 percent of the recreation fees collected at the Canyon Ferry Unit to be deposited in that Unit's recreation account.</summary>
