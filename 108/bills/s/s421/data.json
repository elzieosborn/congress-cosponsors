    "text": "Renewable Energy Production Incentive Reform Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992, prescribing incentive payments for renewable energy production, to direct the Secretary of Energy to assign 60 percent of appropriated funds for a given year to facilities that use solar, wind, geothermal, or closed-loop (dedicated energy crops) biomass technologies to generate electricity, and assign the remaining 40 percent to other projects, if there are insufficient appropriations to make full payments for electric production from all qualified renewable energy facilities in any given year.Redefines a qualified renewable energy facility to include one: (1) owned by specified kinds of public utility, by a State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia, or by an Indian tribal government; and (2) which generates electric energy for sale using certain renewable energy sources, including landfill gas.Extends the eligibility window for incentive payments through FY 2013."
