  <summary date="2004-08-04T14:53:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Service Act for Care and Relief Initiatives for Forces Injured in Combat Engagements (SACRIFICE) of 2004 - Honors the sacrifice of members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have been killed or critically wounded in service, recognizes the heroic efforts of Armed Forces medical personnel, and supports advanced medical technologies that assist such personnel in saving lives and reducing disability rates among members of the Armed Forces.

Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) prescribe Department of Defense (DOD) policy for providing timely notification to next of kin of the status of members of the Armed Forces who are seriously ill or injured in a combat zone; and (2) transmit a copy of that policy to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.

Authorizes FY 2005 appropriations to fund medical equipment and combat casualty technologies for the DOD.</summary>
