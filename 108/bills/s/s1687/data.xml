Manhattan Project National Historical Park Study Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to conduct a study of the historically significant sites associated with the Manhattan Project (the study area), including the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the Hanford Site in the State of Washington, and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, to assess the national significance, suitability, and feasibility of designating one or more sites within such area as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).

Instructs the Secretary to: (1) evaluate, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, the compatibility of designating one or more sites within the study area as an NPS unit with maintaining the security, productivity, and management goals of the Department of Energy (DOE) and public health and safety; and (2) consider existing research by DOE on the historical significance and feasibility of preserving and interpreting the various sites and structures in such area.

Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the findings of the study and the conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.
