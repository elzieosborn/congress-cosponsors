  <summary date="2004-08-21T16:49:24Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal provisions of the low income housing tax credit requiring a bond to cover recapture amounts from the disposition, prior to a 15-year compliance period, of a building (or interest therein) eligible for the credit. Provides for a three-year statute of limitation (from the end of the compliance period) for assessing a recapture deficiency.

Requires owners of buildings eligible for the low income housing tax credit to file informational returns with the Secretary of the Treasury upon the occurrence of a recapture event and to provide persons who are named in such returns with specified information. Imposes penalties for failure to file required returns.</summary>
