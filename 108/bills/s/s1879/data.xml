  <summary date="2004-05-06T22:12:01Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here, with an updated title.)

Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2004 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue a temporary renewal certificate (45-day maximum) to a mammography facility seeking reaccreditation if the accreditation body has issued an accreditation extension based upon the fact that the facility has: (1) submitted the required materials but the accreditation body was unable to complete the reaccreditation process before certification expiration; or (2) acquired additional or replacement equipment, or has had significant personnel changes or other unforeseen situations that have caused it to be unable to meet reaccreditation time frames, but in the opinion of the accreditation body has not compromised mammography quality.

Authorizes the Secretary, upon the request of an accreditation body, to issue a limited provisional certificate to an entity to enable it to conduct examinations for educational purposes while an onsite visit from an accreditation body is in progress (72-hour maximum).

Authorizes appropriations for the mammography facilities certification program through FY 2005.</summary>
