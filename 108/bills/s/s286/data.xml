  <summary date="2016-09-06T21:58:34Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act of 2003 - Amends Public Health Service Act provisions concerning the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities to add "disabilities and health" to categories of data with regard to which the Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to collect, analyze, and make available. Requires the Secretary to conduct research on and promote the prevention of birth defects and disabilities and to support a National Spina Bifida Program to prevent and reduce suffering from the nation's most common permanently disabling birth defect.

Modifies reporting requirements, including to require the Secretary to report to Congress on the incidence and prevalence of individuals living with developmental disabilities and the health status of such individuals. Declares that certain data and information collected under the Act shall be subject to a specified provision of the General Education Provisions Act pertaining to privacy.

Requires that the members of the advisory committee appointed by the Director of the National Center for Environmental Health that have expertise in birth defects, developmental disabilities, and disabilities and health shall be transferred to and shall advise the National Center on Birth Defects on the date of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
