  <summary date="2004-10-15T18:38:02Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to allow professional athletes (including members of minor league teams that are affiliated with professional sports team associations) and members or coaches of certain amateur sports leagues to enter the United States on P-1 nonimmigrant visas (currently, limited to athletes performing at an "internationally recognized level of performance").

Eliminates consultation requirements applicable to the Secretary of Homeland Security's approval of such visas.

Requires the Secretary to permit a petition to seek P-1 classification for multiple alien athletes. Prohibits additional fees for such petitions.

Requires the Secretary to allow athletes or their employers to seek admission for such athletes under INA provisions other than P-1 provisions.</summary>
