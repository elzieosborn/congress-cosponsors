Specifies that such a business shall be illegal if it fails to to comply with money transmitting business registration requirements (current law), whether or not the defendant knew that the operation was required to comply with such requirements. Authorizes the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to investigate violations regarding such businesses.\n\nAmends the Federal criminal code to provide for civil forfeiture of the assets of individuals or entities engaging in planning or perpetrating any act of international terrorism against any international organization or foreign government.\n\nReauthorizes the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998."
