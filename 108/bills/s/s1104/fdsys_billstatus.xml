        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Prohibits physicians from using facilities of the Department of Defense (DOD) to perform an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor who is a child of a member of the armed forces unless: (1) the physician gives at least 24 hours actual notice to the member, another parent of the minor, or a court-appointed conservator or guardian; (2) the judge of an appropriate district court issues an order authorizing the minor to consent to the abortion; (3) the appropriate district court by its inaction constructively authorizes such consent; or (4) the physician concludes that a condition exists that necessitates immediate abortion and certifies to the appropriate medical officer of DOD, and in the patient's medical record, the medical indications supporting such judgment. Outlines provisions concerning: (1) alternative notification; and (2) physician penalties for violations. </p> <p>Allows: (1) such a minor, under specified procedures, to file with the court an application for the performance of the abortion without parental or guardian notification; and (2) for judicial appeal of a denial of such application.</p>]]></text>
