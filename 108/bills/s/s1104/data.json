Outlines provisions concerning: (1) alternative notification; and (2) physician penalties for violations.\n\nAllows: (1) such a minor, under specified procedures, to file with the court an application for the performance of the abortion without parental or guardian notification; and (2) for judicial appeal of a denial of such application."
