Defines \"qualified community lender\" as a local community bank which: (1) achieved a satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs at its most recent Federal bank examination: (2) provided not less than 60 percent of its loans to its local community; (2) meets specified community ownership requirements; and (4) has total assets of not more than $1 billion. Reduces tax rates on certain subchapter S taxable income attributable to community lender income.\n\nExcludes from gross income distressed community banking income. Defines \"distressed community banking income\" as the net income of an FDA-insured bank which is derived from the active conduct of a banking business in a low-income, high unemployment community as defined by the Bank Enterprise Act of 1991."
