Provides for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) beginning January 1, 2006.\n\n(Sec. 132) Provides that: (1) the filing of an asbestos claim for reimbursement for medical monitoring shall not be considered evidence that the claimant has discovered facts that would otherwise commence the period applicable for purposes of the statute of limitations; and (2) reimbursable medical monitoring costs shall include the costs of a claimant not covered by health insurance for x-ray and pulmonary function tests every three years. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations that establish the reasonable costs for medical monitoring and the procedures applicable to asbestos claimants.\n\n(Sec. 133) States that an asbestos claimant who is entitled to an award should receive the amount of the award through structured payments from the Fund over three years and within four years after the final adjudication of the claim.

Authorizes the Administrator to appoint counsel to represent the interests of the Fund and the Administrator in all proceedings before a panel.\n\nDirects a Court panel to apply the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to all proceedings before the panel and to enter a final decision on an appeal on the earlier date occurring not later than 30 days after the conclusion of oral arguments or 60 days after an appeal is filed under this subtitle.\n\nTitle II: Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund - Subtitle A: Asbestos Defendants Funding Allocation - (Sec. 201) Defines \"class action trust\" as a trust or similar entity established to hold assets for the payment of asbestos claims asserted against a debtor or participating defendant under a settlement of class action claims under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that has been approved by a final judgment of a U.S. district court before the date of this Act's enactment.\n\n(Sec. 202) Directs the Administrator to assess from defendant participants contributions to the Fund based on assigned tiers and subtiers. Sets the aggregate contribution level required of all defendant participants. Grants the Administrator authority to allocate the contributions assessed from the defendant participants among the tiers.\n\nDirects the Administrator to assign to Tier I all debtors that, together with all of their direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, have prior asbestos expenditures greater than $1 million.\n\nDefines \"bankrupt business entity\" to mean a person that is not a natural person that: (1) filed under chapter 1 before January 1, 2003; (2) has not confirmed a reorganization plan as of this Act's enactment date; and (3) the bankruptcy court presiding over the business entity's case determines that asbestos liability was not the sole or precipitating cause of the entity's chapter 11 filing. Limits consideration of the question of whether asbestos liability was the sole or precipitating cause of the entity's filing. Directs that any review of this determination be an expedited appeal and limited to whether the decision was against the weight of the evidence.\n\nProvides conditions under which a bankrupt business entity may proceed with a reorganization plan that does not comply with the requirements of this Act.\n\nProvides for the assignment of Tiers II through VI, according to the prior asbestos expenditures paid by such persons or affiliated groups, as specified.\n\nSets forth provisions regarding assignments and costs.\n\n(Sec. 203) Directs the Administrator to assess contributions to persons or affiliated groups within Tiers I through VII as specified. Requires that revenues be determined in accordance with generally accepting accounting principles.\n\nExcludes from the 2002 revenues of a debtor and affiliated group that includes a person with respect to whose liabilities for asbestos claims a class action trust has been established, all revenues of: (1) the person with respect to whose liabilities for asbestos claims the class action trust was established; and (2) the debtor and affiliated group attributable to the historical business operations or assets of such person, regardless of whether such operations or assets were owned or conducted during the year 2002 by such person or by any other person included within such debtor and affiliated group.\n\nRequires the Administrator to assign each debtor in Tier I to subtiers and directs each debtor to make specified contributions to the Fund.\n\nDirects that the assets of any class action trust that has been established with respect to the liabilities for asbestos claims of any person included within a debtor and affiliated group that has been assigned to Tier I (exclusive of any assets needed to pay previously incurred expenses and asbestos claims reduced to a final order or judgment before this Act's enactment) be transferred to the Fund within six months.\n\nDirects the Administrator to assign each person or affiliated group in Tier II thought VI to one of five subtiers, based on revenues.\n\n Requires assignment to Tier VII of a person who: (1) is subject to asbestos claims brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act as a result of operations as a common carrier by railroad; and (2) has paid not less than $5 million in settlement, judgment, defense, or indemnity costs relating to such claims.\n\n(Sec. 204) Directs the Administrator to assess contributions based on amounts provided under this subtitle for each person or affiliated group within Tiers II through VII for the first five years of the Fund's operation, and then to reduce the contribution amount for each defendant participant in each of these tiers in proportion to specified reductions in the schedule. Makes a person or affiliated group that is a small business concern on December 31, 2002, exempt from any contribution requirement. Directs the Administrator to prescribe procedures for payment of contributions.\n\nAuthorizes a defendant participant, under expedited procedures established by the Administrator, to seek adjustment of the amount of its contribution (and renewal of the adjustment) based on severe financial hardship or demonstrated inequity. Prohibits the Administrator from granting adjustments in any year that exceed, in the aggregate, six percent of the total annual contributions required of all defendant participants. Directs the Administrator thereafter to annually determine whether there has been a material change in the defendant's financial condition such that the Administrator may reinstate any part or all of the defendant's contribution under the statutory allocation that was not paid during the adjustment term.\n\nProvides that a defendant: (1) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by demonstrating that the amount of the defendant's contribution under the statutory allocation is exceptionally inequitable when measured against the amount of the likely cost to the defendant of its future liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund, when compared to the median contribution rate for all defendants in the same tier, or when measured against the percentage of the defendant's prior asbestos expenditures that were incurred with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse judgment against the defendant nor were the subject of a settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on behalf of that defendant; and (2) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier subtier adjustment reducing the defendant's contribution based on inequity by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos expenditures arose from claims related to railroad locomotives and related products, as long as such person's manufacture and sale is temporally and causally remote.\n\nSets the defendant's contribution rate as the defendant's contribution stated as a percentage of gross revenues for calendar year 2002. Makes an inequity adjustment granted by the Administrator, subject to the annual availability of funds in the Orphan Share Reserve Account, effective for a term of three years.
