Sets forth criteria for vulnerability determinations.\n\nAuthorizes the use of federally guaranteed funds borrowed from lending institutions for technical assistance and security enhancements.\n\nRequires each State to designate a State agency to evaluate applications for assistance and transmit qualifying applications to the Secretary.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) select applications for assistance, giving preference to nonprofit organizations determined to be at greatest risk of international terrorist attack; and (2) execute contracts for the highest priority applicants until available funds are expended, followed by loan guarantees.\n\nRequires nonprofit organizations granted assistance to use certified contractors selected from a list maintained by the Secretary.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to provide grants to local governments to offset incremental costs associated with law enforcement in areas with a high concentration of nonprofit organizations.\n\nEstablishes within the Department of Homeland Security the Office of Community Relations and Civic Affairs to administer grant programs for nonprofit organizations and local law enforcement assistance."
