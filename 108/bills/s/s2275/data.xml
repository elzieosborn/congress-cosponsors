Requires each State to designate a State agency to evaluate applications for assistance and transmit qualifying applications to the Secretary.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) select applications for assistance, giving preference to nonprofit organizations determined to be at greatest risk of international terrorist attack; and (2) execute contracts for the highest priority applicants until available funds are expended, followed by loan guarantees.

Requires nonprofit organizations granted assistance to use certified contractors selected from a list maintained by the Secretary.

Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to local governments to offset incremental costs associated with law enforcement in areas with a high concentration of nonprofit organizations.
