Establishes the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Trust fund in the Treasury. Appropriates to such Fund amounts equal to 25 percent of the additional revenues received by reason of the above change in the percentage depletion allowance. Prescribes guidelines under which such fund shall be available to the Secretary of the Interior for reclamation and restoration of lands and water resources adversely affected by mineral and mineral material mining (excluding coal and fluid materials)."
