    "text": "Deep Sea Coral Protection Act - Prohibits the use of mobile bottom-tending fishing gear in Coral Management Areas (CMAs).\n\nDesignates CMAs according to specified coordinates. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to designate as additional CMAs areas within the exclusive economic zone that have not been fished with mobile bottom-tending gear in recent years. Authorizes the Secretary to terminate such CMA designations in specified circumstances.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) monitor fishing within the exclusive economic zone and quantify deep sea coral and sponge bycatch; (2) direct the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere to research and map deep sea corals and sponges; and (3) designate as CMAs areas identified through such monitoring and research as having deep sea coral ecosystems.\n\nRequires the Chair of the National Research Council to review annually all available data on deep sea corals and sponges and recommend areas for CMA designation. Directs the Secretary to designate such areas after publication of a proposed rule unless a rational basis for designation is lacking.\n\nApplies the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act's civil penalty and forfeiture requirements to persons who violate this Act's prohibition against the use of mobile bottom-tending gear. Prohibits interference with enforcement of this Act and applies the Magnuson-Stevens Act's criminal penalty scheme to violators.\n\nAuthorizes the President to permit the Secretary to identify, with foreign entities, areas in international waters that would benefit from additional protection."
