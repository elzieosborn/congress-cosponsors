The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nTitle I: Exclusion of Nonnative Species from Migratory Bird Treaty Act - Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act of 2004 - (Sec. 102) Amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) to clarify that the MBTA's prohibition on taking, killing, or possessing migratory birds applies only to native migratory bird species whose occurrence in the United States results from natural biological or ecological conditions.\n\n Excludes from coverage under the MBTA bird species occurring as the result of human-assisted introduction unless the species: (1) was native to the United States and extant in 1918; (2) became extinct throughout its range thereafter; and (3) was reintroduced as part of a Federal program.\n\n(Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish a list of all nonnative, human introduced bird species to which the MBTA does not apply that belong to biological families of migratory birds covered under any migratory bird conventions with Great Britain (for Canada), Mexico, Russia, or Japan.\n\nTitle II: Conservation of Neotropical Migratory Birds - Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Improvement Act of 2004 - (Sec. 202) Amends the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act to increase the Federal share of costs for projects funded under that Act. Provides that the non-Federal share shall be paid in cash for projects undertaken in the United States or Canada, but may be paid in cash or in kind for projects in Latin America or the Caribbean.\n\nEstablishes the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund."
