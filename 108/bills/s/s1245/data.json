    "text": "Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2003 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish an Interagency Committee to Coordinate and Streamline Homeland Security Grant Programs.\n\nDirects the Committee to: (1) report all findings to an Information Clearinghouse (established by this Act); (2) consult with State and local governments and emergency response providers regarding their homeland security needs and capabilities; (3) advise the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the development of performance measures for homeland security grant programs and the national strategy for homeland security; (4) within 60 days, compile a list of any homeland security assistance programs and their reporting requirements requested by the Committee, including programs and grants of the following, the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); (5) within 60 days, identify all homeland security planning requirements contained in homeland security emergency preparedness and public safety programs administered by Federal agencies; (6) within 120 days, review all application, reporting, and other administrative requirements contained in such grant programs, and all homeland security planning and other administrative requirements, and report all redundant and duplicative requirements to the appropriate committees and agencies; (7) within 150 days, provide recommendations to agencies in order to streamline and standardize application, reporting, and administrative and planning requirements to eliminate duplication and promote coordination; and (8) within 250 days, issue a report to Congress regarding its actions.\n\nDirects that the Committee be composed of representatives of the Departments of Homeland Security, HHS, Transportation, and Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, and any other department or agency determined to be necessary by the President.\n\n(Sec. 3) Provides that the Office for State and Local Government Coordination (OSLGC) within the Office of the Secretary of DHS shall be headed by a Director appointed by the President.\n\nTransfers administration of the firefighter assistance grant program and ODP to OSLGC. Directs the Secretary to: (1) create within ODP an internal office that shall be the proponent for all national domestic preparedness training, education, and exercises within OSLGC; and (2) select an individual with recognized expertise in first-responder training and exercises to head the office, who shall report directly to the Director of ODP.\n\nEstablishes a Homeland Security Information Clearinghouse within OSLGC to assist States, local governments, and first responders. Directs the Clearinghouse to: (1) create and maintain a website, a toll-free number, and a single publication containing information regarding homeland security grant programs; (2) coordinate technical assistance provided by any Federal agency to States and local governments to conduct threat analyses and vulnerability assessments, and establish templates for conducting such analyses and assessments; (3) work with States, local governments, emergency response providers, the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, and private organizations to gather, validate, and disseminate information regarding successful State and local homeland security programs and practices; (4) compile information regarding equipment, training, and other services purchased with Federal funds under homeland security grant programs, and make such information, and information regarding voluntary standards of training, equipment, and exercises, available to States, local governments, and first responders; and (5) provide States, local governments, and first responders with any other information that the Secretary determines necessary.\n\n(Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary to award homeland security grants to States. Specifies the permissible and impermissible uses for grant funds. Authorizes the payment of overtime expenses relating to: (1) training activities consistent with the goals outlined in a State homeland security plan; and (2) as determined by the Secretary, activities relating to an increase in the threat level under the Homeland Security Advisory System. Permits the use of not more than five percent of grant funds for overtime expenses for training. Authorizes the Secretary to waive this limitation if necessary to provide effective training or adequate protection in the event of an increase in the threat level.\n\nRequires State grant applications to include certification that the State has prepared a three-year homeland security plan to respond to terrorist attacks and strengthen all hazards emergency planning that has been approved by the Secretary. Requires the plan to contain measurable goals and objectives that: (1) establish a three-year strategy to set priorities for the allocation of funding to political subdivisions based on risk, capabilities, and needs; (2) providing for interoperable communications; (3) provide for local coordination of response and recovery efforts; (4) ensure that first responders and other emergency personnel have adequate training and appropriate equipment for the threats that may occur; (5) provide for improved coordination and collaboration among police, fire, and public health authorities at State and local levels; (6) coordinate emergency response and public health plans; (7) mitigate risks to critical infrastructure that may be vulnerable to terrorist attacks; (8) promote regional coordination among contiguous local governments; (9) identify necessary protective measures by private owners of critical infrastructure; (10) promote orderly evacuation procedures when necessary; (11) ensure support from the public health community for measures needed to prevent, detect, and treat bioterrorism, and radiological and chemical incidents; (12) increase the number of local jurisdictions participating in local and statewide exercises; (13) meet preparedness goals; and (14) include a report from the State's advisory committee (as established below) that documents the areas of support, disagreement, or recommended changes to the plan before its submission to the Secretary.\n\nRequires a State, in preparing the plan, to: (1) provide for the consideration of all homeland security needs; (2) follow a process that is continuing, inclusive, cooperative, and comprehensive; and (3) coordinate the development of the plan with the homeland security planning activities of local governments. Requires that such coordination include input from local stakeholders, including: (1) local officials, including representatives of rural, high-population, and high-threat jurisdictions; (2) first responders and emergency response providers; and (3) private sector companies, such as railroads and chemical manufacturers.\n\nRequires each State preparing a plan to: (1) complete a comprehensive assessment of risk, capabilities, and needs; and (2) establish an advisory committee to receive comments from the public and the local stakeholders, which shall include local officials, local first responders, and emergency response providers that are representative of the counties, cities, and towns within the State, and which shall include representatives of rural, high-population, and high-threat jurisdictions.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) approve a plan upon finding that the plan meets specified requirements, including interim performance measurements or national performance standards; and (2) review the recommendations of the advisory committee report incorporated into a plan, including any dissenting views submitted by advisory committee members, to ensure cooperation and coordination between local and State jurisdictions in planning the use of grant funds.\n\nRequires the Secretary to use ten percent of the funds appropriated for the Homeland Security Grant Program for discretionary grants to local governments to high threat areas.
