  <summary date="2004-06-16T22:18:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">SAFE-ID Act - Authorizes a business to transmit personally identifiable information regarding a U.S. citizen to any foreign affiliate or subcontractor located in a country certified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as having adequate privacy protection for such information. Prohibits such business from transmitting such information to an affiliate or subcontractor in a country without such privacy protection unless: (1) the business discloses to the citizen that the country does not have such privacy protection; (2) the business obtains the citizen's consent to transmit such information; and (3) the consent is renewed by the citizen within one year before the information is transmitted. Provides liability for businesses improperly transmitting such information.

Makes any business or organization that collects or retains personally identifiable health care information about consumers (health care business) liable for any damages caused by improper storage, duplication, sharing, or other misuse of such information by the health care business or any foreign affiliate or subcontractor that received such information. Prohibits a health care business from terminating an existing relationship with a consumer of health care services in order to avoid the consent requirement.

Directs the FTC to certify, and make a list of, those countries that have legal systems that provide adequate privacy protection for such information.</summary>
