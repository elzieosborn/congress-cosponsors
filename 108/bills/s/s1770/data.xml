  <summary date="2004-03-31T21:15:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Indian Money Account Claim Satisfaction Act of 2003 - Establishes the Indian Money Account Claim Satisfaction Task Force: (1) to complete an analysis of records, data, and other historical information with regard to the conduct of an historical accounting submitted by the parties in the class action to the district court in January 2003 (Cobell v. Norton (No. 96cv01285, D.D.C.)); and (2) after such completion to hold meetings with representatives of the plaintiffs in the civil action, the Departments of Justice and of the Interior and any other parties that, in the discretion of the Task Force, are necessary to carryout out its duties.

Requires the Task Force to develop appropriate methodologies or models to conduct an accounting to determine in current dollars the balances of: (1) all individual Indian money accounts opened in or after 1985; (2) all individual Indian money accounts opened on or after the enactment of a certain Act of June 24, 1938, regarding deposit, care, and investment of Indian moneys, and before 1985; and (3) all individual Indian money accounts opened before such enactment.

Establishes the Indian Money Claims Tribunal to serve as arbitrator if an eligible individual elects to have the amount of the balance in the individual Indian money account determined through arbitration. Binds the individual and the United States to any determination made by the Tribunal.

Requires payments made pursuant to this Act to be derived from the permanent judgment appropriation (commonly known as the Judgment Fund), without further appropriations.</summary>
