Limits the fees to a percentage based on the amount awarded.\n\nPrescribes qualifications for expert witnesses.\n\nPermits the court to reduce damages received by the amount of collateral source benefits to which a claimant is entitled.\n\nAuthorizes the award of punitive damages only where: (1) it is proven that a person acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury the claimant was substantially certain to suffer; and (2) compensatory damages are awarded. Limits punitive damages to the greater of two times the amount of economic damages or $250,000.\n\nLimits the liability of manufacturers, distributors, and providers of obstetrical or gynecological products that comply with Food and Drug Administration standards.\n\n Provides for periodic payments of future damage awards."
