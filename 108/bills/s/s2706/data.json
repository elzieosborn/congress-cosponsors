Allows States to use part E funds to make such payments under specified conditions.\n\nRequires States to: (1) notify all adult grandparents and other adult relatives (with exceptions due to family or domestic violence) when a child is removed from custody of a parent or parents; and (2) explain the options the relative has to participate in the child's care and placement."
