  <summary date="2004-07-07T21:15:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2004 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require the voting system to permit a voter to verify the accuracy of his or her ballot by allowing the voter to review an individual paper version of the ballot before it is cast and counted.

Provides the voter with the opportunity to change the ballot or correct any error discovered on the individual paper version. Requires the voting system to preserve: (1) the individual paper version of the voter's ballot, after the voter has certified that it accurately reflects the voter's intent, as the individual permanent paper record; and (2) such permanent record at the polling place.

Requires the voting system to produce an individual permanent paper record for each ballot that is cast which provides for voter verification of the record and which will serve as the official record for purposes of any recount.

Provides that, in the event of any inconsistencies or irregularities between any electronic records and the individual permanent paper records, the individual permanent paper records shall be the true and correct record of the votes cast.</summary>
