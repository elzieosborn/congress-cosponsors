(Permits unused loss carryover.) Provides for: (1) subsidiary stock basis adjustment; and (2) waiver of the five-year reconsolidation waiting period for certain formerly includible corporations which became nonincludible as a result of becoming a subsidiary of a nonincludible life insurance company."
