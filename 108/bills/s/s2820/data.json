    "text": "Spectrum Availability for Emergency-Response and Law-Enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency Services (SAVE LIVES) Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from granting any extension in the required reassignment of broadcasting stations between 764 and 776 and 794 and 806 megahertz for public safety services. Directs the FCC to complete the assignment of the electromagnetic spectrum between such stations, and to permit operations by public safety services on those frequencies commencing no later than January 1, 2008. Authorizes the FCC, beginning on such date, to modify or reassign the licenses of licensees as necessary to permit such new operations. Allows the FCC to waive such requirements in specified circumstances.\n\nRequires the FCC to report to specified congressional committees on strategies for meeting public safety communications needs and the advisability of reallocating spectrum in the 700 megahertz band for unlicensed broadband uses.\n\nAmends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security's Under Secretary for Science and Technology to establish the Wireless Public Safety Interoperability Communications Program (SAFECOM) and to complete a communications interoperability study. Authorizes appropriations.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a grant program to help first responders acquire and deploy interoperable communications equipment.\n\nEstablishes the Digital Transition Consumer Assistance Fund. Authorizes appropriations.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to assist households in transitioning from analog to digital television. Requires the program to: (1) become publicly available no later than January 1, 2008; and (2) give first priority to assisting lower income households.\n\nGives the FCC authority to require analog television sets sold or offered for sale after September 30, 2005, that will be incapable of broadcasting digital signals without an external device to be labeled as such.\n\nRequires the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to recommend to specified congressional committees a program to educate consumers about the transition to digital broadcast signals.\n\nDirects the FCC to issue final decisions in three pending proceedings. Requires the FCC, in one of the proceedings, to establish minimum guidelines for locally originated programming, local electoral and public affairs programming, and independently produced programming for television broadcast licensees."
