States that the trust relationship and an approved Plan can coexist.Replaces the current Office of Special Trustee for American Indians with a Deputy Secretary for Trust Management and Reform to oversee all Indian trust fund and trust asset matters and to consult with Indian tribes and individual trust asset and trust fund account holders. Directs the Deputy Secretary to establish an advisory board on matters within the jurisdiction of the Office of Trust Reform.Establishes within the office of the Secretary the Office of Trust Reform Implementation and Oversight, headed by such Deputy Secretary, to supervise and direct day-to-day activities concerning such assets or funds, including providing accurate inventories, revenue postings, monthly statements, and annual audits.Directs the Deputy Secretary to establish a Tribal Task Force on Trust Reform to study and report to Congress on appropriate standards and procedures for inventorying and managing trust assets."
