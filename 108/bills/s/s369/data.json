Requires the Secretary to notify and provide a copy of a petition to the State agency of each State in which the species is believed to occur and to solicit the assessment of such agency as to whether the petitioned action is warranted.Directs the Secretary, upon publication of a proposed regulation determining an endangered or threatened listing, to make publicly available all information on which the determination is based, as well as all information relating to the species that does not support such determination (with an exception for disclosures protected under the Freedom of Information Act or the Privacy Act).Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations that establish criteria that must be met for scientific and commercial data to be used as the basis for a determination that a species is an endangered or threatened species."
