        <text><![CDATA[ Community College Partnership Act of 2003 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a community college opportunity program to help students at community or technical colleges (CTCs) to transfer to four-year institutions of higher education (IHEs) and complete baccalaureate degrees. <p>Directs the Secretary of Education to award not less than six and not more than 12 program grants to eligible entities. Makes eligible for such grants: (1) partnerships that include one or more CTCs that award associate's degrees and one or more IHEs that offer a baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate degree not awarded by the partner colleges; or (2) a statewide governance or coordinating board that has jurisdiction over both CTCs and IHEs, or a partnership of such boards that have separate jurisdiction over such entities. <p>Requires funds from such grants to be used for: (1) development of policies to expand opportunities for community or technical college students to earn baccalaureate degrees, including promoting the transfer of academic credits between institutions and expanding articulation and guaranteed transfer agreements; (2) support services to students participating in the program, including tutoring, mentoring, academic and personal counseling, and transition facilitation; (3) academic program enhancements at the community or technical college that increase program quality and the number of student participants in the dual degree program offered in conjunction with a baccalaureate degree granting institution; and (4) programs to identify barriers that inhibit student transfers.]]></text>
