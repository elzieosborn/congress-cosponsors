  <summary date="2003-07-16T15:13:12Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Economic Opportunity Protection Act of 2003 - Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to repeal the protection from Federal preemption currently granted to any provision of State law enacted after January 1, 2004 that states explicitly that it is intended to supplement the FCRA and give greater protection to consumers than is provided under Federal statute. (Thus permits Federal preemption of more stringent State consumer protection laws.)
