    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on September 15, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAmends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 to increase funding levels for projects to preserve the structural safety of Bureau of Reclamation dams and related facilities. Increases the ceiling (from $750,000 to $1.25 million) on the amount that may be obligated for dam modifications prior to 30 calendar days from the date that the Secretary of the Interior has reported on the safety of the existing dam to Congress.\n\nDirects the Secretary: (1) during the construction of a modification of a structure under such Act, to consider cost containment measures recommended by a project beneficiary that has elected to consult with the Bureau; (2) to provide to project beneficiaries periodic notice regarding the costs and status of the modification; (3) upon identifying a Bureau facility for modification, to provide to the project beneficiaries written notice describing the need for and the process for identifying and implementing the modification and summarizing administrative and legal requirements; (4) to provide project beneficiaries an opportunity to consult with the Bureau on the planning, design, and construction of the proposed modification and to develop and provide time frames for such consultation; (5) prior to submitting required reports, to consider any alternative submitted by a project beneficiary that has elected to consult with the Bureau; and (6) to provide to the project beneficiary a timely written response of proposed actions to address the recommendation. (Requires that the Secretary's response be included in the required reports.)\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to waive one or more of the requirements of this Act upon determining that implementation of the requirement could have an adverse impact on dam safety or security."
