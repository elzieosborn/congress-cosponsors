    "text": "Mercury Reduction Act of 2003 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to: (1) prohibit the sale or supply of mercury fever thermometers to consumers, except by prescription; and (2) require manufacturers to provide clear instructions on handling of thermometers to avoid breakage and on proper cleanup in the event of breakage. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to provide grants for a household mercury thermometer collection and exchange program. Establishes a Task Force on Mercury to make recommendations on: (1) the long-term management of surplus mercury collected from thermometers and from medical, commercial, government, and industrial and other sources; (2) programs to test technologies for sequestration of retired mercury; (3) storage of mercury in a manner that ensures no release into the environment; (4) reduction of the total threat posed by mercury to humans and the environment; and (5) reduction of mercury produced, used, and released. Directs the Administrator, in consultation with the Task Force, to: (1) take title to mercury collected under the thermometer exchange program or from another source; (2) manage the mercury in a manner that prevents its release into the environment; (3) ensure that collected mercury is not reintroduced into commerce; (4) provide to the Task Force an analysis of, and recommendations concerning, collection and management activities under this Act; and (5) identify stabilization technologies and long-term storage measures that prevent mercury release and conduct appropriate research, development, and demonstration."
