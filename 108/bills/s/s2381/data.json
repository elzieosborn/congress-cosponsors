    "text": "Safe, Orderly, Legal Visas and Enforcement Act (or SOLVE Act) of 2004 - Creates an earned adjustment program for undocumented aliens (and their spouses and children) who meet specified requirements. Excludes aliens granted earned adjustment from numerical visa limitations.\n\nAmends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to allow such aliens to correct social security records.\n\nCreates transitional status for certain aliens who do not satisfy earned adjustment requirements.\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act to exempt immediate relatives from the family-sponsored immigrant cap. Redefines \"immediate relatives\" to include spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents.\n\nRecaptures certain unused visa numbers.\n\nReduces the minimum income level for affidavits of support.\n\nIncreases to 21 the eligibility age for derivative citizenship.\n\nRepeals, retroactively, barriers to reentry for unlawful presence.\n\n Redefines the H-2B nonimmigrant worker category to include aliens coming temporarily to perform short-term service or labor for nine months or less. Adds an H-1D category for aliens coming temporarily to perform service or labor other than that performed by specified nonimmigrants.\n\nRequires employers seeking H-1D or H-2B workers to undertake recruitment efforts for U.S. workers and submit labor attestations. Provides for derivative status for spouses and children of H-1D and H-2B workers. Makes such workers eligible for employment-based immigrant visas and adjustment of status.\n\nAuthorizes stays of removal for aliens involved in workplace claims.\n\nAddresses backpay remedies and unfair immigration-related employment practices.\n\nCreates a Temporary Worker Programs Commission."
