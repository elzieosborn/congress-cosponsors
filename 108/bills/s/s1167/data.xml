  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Establishes procedures for resolving the status of Federal land in Barry and Stone County, Missouri, which is claimed by private property owners based on land surveys subsequent to the Public Land Survey System land surveys upon which the original land patents were issued. Directs the appropriate Secretary (the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Agriculture), upon receiving notification of a boundary conflict from a qualifying claimant, to: (1) convey and quitclaim all right, title, and interest of the United States in the overlapping land; or (2) if there are Federal interests in such land, to confirm Federal title to it and retain it in Federal management, while compensating the qualifying claimant. Establishes rules for the treatment of preexisting conditions, existing reservations, and existing rights and uses. Requires any qualifying claimant to file for resolution of a boundary conflict within 15 years of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
