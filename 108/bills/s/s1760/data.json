    "text": "United States Patent and Trademark Fee Modernization Act of 2003 - Amends Federal patent law to: (1) lower patent filing and basic national fees; (2) increase excess claims, disclaimer, appeal, extension, revival, and maintenance fees; and (3) add new application examination, patent search, and patent issuance fees.\n\nPrescribes fees under the Trademark Act of 1946 for electronic and paper applications for trademark registration. Credits all Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) funds to a PTO Account in the Treasury. Exempts such funds from the appropriation process, thus allowing the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of PTO to collect such funds and use them for PTO operations until expended."
