Russell National School Lunch Act (NSLA) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to make competitive grants to private nonprofit entities and educational institutions to establish and carry out Farm-to-Cafeteria projects to improve access to local foods in schools and institutions receiving funds under NSLA and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (CNA) (except the special supplemental program for women, infants, and children (WIC), which already has a WIC Farmers Market Nutrition program).\n\nRequires the Secretary, in selecting such projects, to give preference to ones designed to: (1) procure local foods from small and medium-sized farms to provide foods for school meals; (2) support nutrition education activities or curriculum planning incorporating school children's participation in farm and agriculture education projects; and (3) develop a sustained commitment to farm-to-cafeteria projects in the community by linking schools, agricultural producers, parents, and other community stakeholders.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer a specified amount, at the beginning of each of FY 2003 through 2007, to the Secretary to carry out this Act."
