    "text": "Call to Service Act - Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (NCSA) and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA) to reauthorize appropriations and revise requirements for national volunteer service programs administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS).\n\nRevises NCSA programs, including: (1) Learn and Serve America programs of service-learning for elementary and secondary students, for higher education and work-study, as well as for community-based training, programs, and initiatives, and for a service-learning clearinghouse; (2) a National Service Trust Program (AmeriCorps grants), including an E-Corps; (3) the National Service Trust and provision of National Service Educational Awards (to AmeriCorps members and participants in certain other community service programs, including a new program of service-based awards to secondary students); and (4) the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC); (5) grants to America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth; and (6) grants to the Points of Light Foundation.\n\nEstablishes a service-based scholarship program to recognize secondary school juniors and seniors who are engaged in outstanding community service and scholarship. Authorizes CNCS to pay up to $500 to match an equal local contribution for a scholarship to help cover an individual's postsecondary education or job training costs.\n\nRevises NCSA requirements for investment for quality and innovation to authorize grants to assist Internet volunteer recruiting entities to locate, promote, and match volunteers with local service and volunteer organizations. Repeals provisions for a special demonstration project for the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta of Alaska. Revises DVSA programs for: (1) Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) (National Volunteer Antipoverty Programs); and (2) the National Senior Service Corps, including the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), Foster Grandparents, and Senior Companions. Lowers the age for senior service from 60 to 55. Revises NCSA and DVSA requirements for CNCS administration of national volunteer service programs and for accountability of recipients of funds. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1)programs established or authorized by this Act, and those which receive funding under NCSA or DVSA, are encouraged to provide recruitment and application materials in languages other than English in order to serve communities of limited English proficiency; and (2) such programs may use such funding to provide and distribute such materials."
