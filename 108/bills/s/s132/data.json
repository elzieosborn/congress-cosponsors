Expresses the sense of Congress that States should enact a moratorium on executions to allow time to review whether their administration of the death penalty is consistent with constitutional requirements of fairness, justice, equality, and due process.Establishes the National Commission on the Death Penalty to: (1) determine whether administration of the death penalty comports with such constitutional requirements; and (2) establish guidelines and procedures which ensure that death penalty cases are administered fairly and impartially in accordance with due process, minimize the risk that innocent persons may be executed, and ensure that the death penalty is not administered in a racially discriminatory manner."
