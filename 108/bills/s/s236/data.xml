  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends Federal aviation law to require a background check of alien flight school applicants without regard to the maximum certificated weight of the aircraft for which they seek training. (Currently, a background check is required for aircraft with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or more.) Exempts from such requirement any alien who: (1) has earned a Federal Aviation Administration type rating in an aircraft; or (2) holds a current pilot's license that allows the person to fly an aircraft with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of more than 12,500 pounds.Requires the Secretary of Transportation and the Attorney General to report jointly to specified congressional committees on the effectiveness of the background check requirement.</summary>
