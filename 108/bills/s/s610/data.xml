Provides the authority to: (1) pay recruitment, redesignation, and relocation bonuses; (2) make term appointments and related personnel actions; (3) fix basic rates of pay; and (4) extend intergovernmental personnel act assignments.Requires the NASA Administrator, before exercising any such authorities, to submit a written workforce plan to the Office of Personnel Management for approval. Requires such plan to be provided to all NASA employees at least 60 days in advance of its implementation. Outlines requirements for each of the authorities.Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) conduct employee exchanges with private entities; (2) carry out a program under which science and technology scholarships are provided to students in exchange for their agreement to be employed by NASA upon graduation; (3) appoint distinguished scholars as NASA employees; (4) pay travel, transportation, and relocation expenses of new appointees; (5) deem periods of certain non-Federal service as Federal service for annual leave qualification purposes; and (6) provide superior qualifications pay to certain employees.Limits the number of NASA limited emergency appointees to ten percent of the total number of Senior Executive Service positions allocated to NASA.</summary>
