Allows a provider to include the wireless telephone information of any new subscriber in a WDAS only if the provider provides: (1) a conspicuous, separate notice to the subscriber, at the time of entering into a service agreement and at least once a year thereafter, of the right not to be listed in any WDAS; and (2) the subscriber with convenient mechanisms to decline or refuse to participate in any WDAS.

Allows a provider to connect a calling party from a WDAS to a commercial mobile service subscriber only if: (1) the subscriber is provided prior notice of the calling party's identity and is permitted to accept or reject each call; (2) the subscriber's wireless telephone number information is not disclosed to the calling party; and (3) the subscriber is not an unlisted commercial mobile service subscriber.

Prohibits a provider from charging a subscriber for the exercise of any rights under this Act.</summary>
