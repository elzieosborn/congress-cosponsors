  <summary date="2004-05-13T20:43:37Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 to prohibit a U.S. court from recognizing, enforcing, or otherwise validating the assertion of rights, including treaty rights, by an individual (currently, by a designated Cuban national) of a mark, trade name, or commercial name that was used in connection with a business or assets that were confiscated unless the original owner of such mark or name, or their bona fide successor, has expressly consented thereto. Makes such prohibition applicable only if the individual asserting the rights knew or had reason to know at the time of of acquiring the rights asserted that the mark or name was the same or substantially similar to the mark or name used in connection with the business or assets that were confiscated.</summary>
