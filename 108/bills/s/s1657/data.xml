  <summary date="2003-12-04T18:39:28Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Declares the sense of Congress that members of a flight deck crew of a cargo aircraft should be armed with a firearm and taser to defend the cargo aircraft against an attack by terrorists that could result in the aircraft's use as a weapon of mass destruction or for other terrorist purposes.

Amends Federal transportation law to expand the Federal flight deck officer program (providing for the arming of pilots of passenger aircraft) to include pilots of cargo aircraft.</summary>
