    "text": "Auditor Independence and Tax Shelters Act - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit a registered public accounting firm from providing tax shelter services to their audit clients.\n\nDefines tax shelter services as services provided by a registered public accounting firm (or by an associated person of that firm) to an issuer, or an officer or director of an issuer, to design, organize, promote, assist, or execute any investment, entity, plan, arrangement, or transaction for which a significant purpose is the avoidance or evasion of Federal income tax by such issuer, or an officer or director of such issuer, whether acting as a direct or indirect participant, and for which such firm may receive fees in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate.\n\nRequires an audit committee, as a prerequisite to its approval of a non-audit service, to determine whether a reasonable likelihood exists that the service would impair the independence of the registered public accounting firm by resulting in the firm's: (1) auditing its own work for the issuer; (2) performing a management function for the issuer; (3) advocating in a public forum for the issuer; or (4) promoting the stock or other financial interest of the issuer.\n\nProhibits the audit committee from providing advance approval of such service if it determines that such a reasonable likelihood exists."
