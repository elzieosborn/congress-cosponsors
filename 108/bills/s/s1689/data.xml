Chapter 2: Military Construction - Makes appropriations for military construction for the Army and Air Force.

Chapter 3: General Provisions, This Title - (Sec. 301) Amends the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 to increase from $300 million to $450 million the aggregate value of authorized assistance to the Government of Afghanistan and eligible foreign countries and international organizations to direct the drawdown of defense articles and services and military education and training.

(Sec. 306) Increases during FY 2004 the: (1) rates of hostile fire or imminent danger special pay; and (2) family separation allowance for military personnel.

(Sec. 314) Authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to $150 million of funds appropriated to the contingency construction account to carry out military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law, after notifying the appropriate congressional committees that the transfer is necessary to respond to, or protect against, acts or threatened acts of terrorism or to support DOD operations in Iraq.

(Sec. 315) Expresses the sense of the Senate recognizing and commending: (1) members of the U.S. armed forces and the allies of the United States and their ground forces who participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq; and (2) the military families, employers, defense civilians and contractors, and communities and patriotic organizations that lent their support to the armed forces during such Operations.

(Sec. 316) Makes funds from the Iraq Freedom Fund available to reimburse military personnel for costs of air fare incurred for travel within the United States in FY 2003 or 2004 while the member is on rest and recuperation leave from deployment overseas in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, but only for one round trip by air between two locations within the United States.

(Sec. 317) Allows the administering Secretaries, at any time after notifying members of the Ready Reserve that they are to be called or ordered to active duty, to provide to each such member any medical and dental screening and care necessary to meet applicable standards for deployment. Requires the Secretary concerned to promptly notify such members of their eligibility for such screening and care. Terminates such authority on September 30, 2004.

(Sec. 318) Makes each member of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve who is placed in a mobilization category (subject to being ordered to active duty involuntarily) eligible to enroll in TRICARE and receive benefits for any period that such member: (1) is an eligible unemployment compensation recipient; or (2) is not eligible for health-care benefits under an employer-sponsored health benefits plan. Allows either self alone or self and family TRICARE coverage. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for at least one open enrollment period each year; and (2) charge appropriate premiums for such coverage.

Limits DOD premium payment amounts and provides a conditional coverage period. Requires the continuation of COBRA coverage during such period. Prohibits simultaneous coverage under both the qualified health plan and TRICARE.

(Sec. 320) Sets forth conditions under which a member of the reserves who is issued a delayed-effective-date active duty order shall be treated as being on active duty for more than 30 days and therefore eligible for medical and dental care for active-duty personnel.

(Sec. 325) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) any U.S. citizen who was a prisoner of war or who was used by the regime of Saddam Hussein and Iraq as a so-called human shield during the First Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm) should have the opportunity to have any claim for damages caused by Saddam Hussein and Iraq fully adjudicated in the appropriate U.S. district court; (2) any judgment obtained therefrom should be fully enforced; and (3) the Attorney General should enter into negotiations with each such citizen or his or her family to develop a method of providing compensation for such damages, including the use of seized assets of the Hussein regime.

(Sec. 326) Directs: (1) the Secretary to report to the defense committees on the utilization of the National Guard and reserves in support of contingency operations during FY 2004; and (2) the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to Congress on the effects of the deployments of the National Guard and reserves on law enforcement and homeland security in the United States.

(Sec. 327) Requires quarterly reports, through FY 2004, from the Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence for Strategy and Iraq to the intelligence committees and specified defense subcommittees on the status of efforts of the Iraq Survey Group to account for the programs of Iraq on weapons of mass destruction and related delivery systems.

(Sec. 328) Provides for the determination of the initial deployment date for members called or ordered to active duty and deployed outside the United States.

(Sec. 329) Earmarks specified funds appropriated under this title for the Family Readiness Program of the National Guard.

(Sec. 332) - Reservists Pay Security Act of 2003 - Entitles a person who is absent from his or her position of Federal employment in order to perform active duty under a call or order to active duty to receive from his or her agency an amount that, when added to the pay and allowances for such service, equals the basic pay which would have been payable to such employee for the period of service for which such employee is not otherwise compensated. Requires the application of Federal reemployment rights for such individuals. Terminates such authority at the end of FY 2004.

(Sec. 333) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary should, on an expedited basis, issue necessary regulations to implement the award of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (based on deployment abroad for 30 days or more in support of Global War on Terrorism operations on or after September 11, 2001) and to ensure that any person who renders qualifying service with the armed forces, including Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and Noble Eagle, promptly receives such award.

(Sec. 334) Places at 90 percent the Federal share of the cost of any disaster relief payment made under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for damage caused by Hurricane Isabel.

Chapter 3: General Provisions, This Title - (Sec. 2304) Amends the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 to extend through FY 2005 the authority of the President to: (1) suspend the application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990; and (2) export to Iraq, under certain circumstances, lethal military equipment designated by the Secretary of State for use by a reconstituted (or interim) Iraqi military or private security force, other official Iraqi security forces or police forces, or forces from other countries in Iraq that support U.S. efforts there.

Directs the Comptroller General (CG) to conduct an ongoing audit of the CPA, and authorizes the CG to conduct additional investigations as appropriate, to evaluate such activities. Requires a report from the CG to the appropriations committees on all audit and investigation results.

(Sec. 2311) Prohibits the use of available funds from this Act or the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 for paying any costs associated with debts incurred by the former government of Saddam Hussein.

(Sec. 2312) Amends the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of State to submit to specified committees reports on progress made in accomplishing the "Purposes of Assistance" set forth under such Act with respect to assistance provided for Afghanistan.

(Sec. 2313) Provides criminal penalties for war profiteering or fraud committed against the United States or Iraq in connection with military action, relief, and reconstruction efforts in Iraq.

(Sec. 2315) Directs the Secretary to certify to Congress the amount that Iraq will pay, or that will be paid on its behalf, during FY 2004 to a foreign country to service a debt incurred by Iraq during the regime of Saddam Hussein. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to reserve, out of certain unobligated funds appropriated under this Act, the amount so certified. Expresses the sense of Congress that each country that is owed such a debt by Iraq should forgive it.

(Sec. 2316) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) arbitrary deadlines should not be set for the dissolution of the CPA or the transfer of its authority to an Iraqi governing authority; and (2) no such dissolution or transfer should occur until the ratification of an Iraqi constitution and the establishment of an elected Iraqi government.

(Sec. 2317) Directs the CG to: (1) review the effectiveness of relief and reconstruction activities conducted by the CPA with the use of funds made available from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRR Fund); and (2) report quarterly to specified congressional committees on review results.

Directs the President to notify Congress if, out of the first two amounts earmarked, more than $250 million is used for any single purpose in Iraq.
