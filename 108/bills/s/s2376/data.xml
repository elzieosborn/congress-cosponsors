  <summary date="2004-07-13T20:27:34Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Working Family Tax Relief Act of 2004 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the scheduled reductions in: (1) the amount of the child tax credit for taxable years 2005 through 2009 (maintains the current $1,000 credit amount for all taxable years after 2004); (2) the basic standard deduction for married taxpayers filing joint returns and surviving spouses for taxable years 2005 through 2008; and (3) the increased upper limit threshold amounts for qualifying married individuals filing joint returns for the 15 and ten percent income tax brackets. Allows an inflation adjustment to such threshold amounts for taxable years beginning after 2003 based on the difference from the Consumer Price Index for 2002.

Exempts from the general terminating date (December 31, 2010) under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 provisions relating to: (1) the increased upper limit amounts for the ten and 15 percent tax bracket for married taxpayers filing joint returns and surviving spouses; (2) the increase in the child tax credit; (3) the increased standard deduction for married taxpayers filing joint returns; and (4) the earned income tax credit.

Extends the increased amounts of the exemption from the alternative minimum tax for individual taxpayers through 2005.</summary>
