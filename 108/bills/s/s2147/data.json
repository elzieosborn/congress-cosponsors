    "text": "Broadcast Decency Responsibility and Enforcement Act of 2004 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide that, if the violator of the terms and conditions of any Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license, permit, or certificate is a broadcast station licensee or permittee, an applicant for a broadcast license, permit, or certificate, or any other company or individual determined by the FCC to have participated in broadcasting obscene, indecent, or profane language, the amount of forfeiture penalty shall be 25 cents times the number of individuals who witnessed or heard the broadcast, as determined by a viewership rating service selected by the FCC. Requires amounts so collected to be used: (1) first, to fund enforcement costs; and (2) to make grants to faith-based programs selected by the Faith Based Initiative Office of the White House.\n\nDirects the FCC to establish a Council of Decency to advise the FCC on standards of decency as applied to broadcasts over which the FCC has jurisdiction."
