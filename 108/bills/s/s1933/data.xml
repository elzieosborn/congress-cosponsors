  <summary date="2004-04-06T20:29:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Enhancing Federal Obscenity Reporting and Copyright Enforcement Act of 2003 - Amends Federal copyright law to provide that a certificate of registration shall satisfy registration requirements irrespective of any inaccurate information on the registration application, unless: (1) the inaccurate information was included on the application with knowledge that it was inaccurate; and (2) the inaccurate information, if known, would have caused the Register of Copyrights to refuse registration.

Requires the court, in any case in which such inaccuracies are alleged, to request the Register to advise the court whether the inaccurate information, if known, would have caused the Register to refuse registration.

Allows a court, in computing statutory damages for copyright infringements, to determine that all the parts of a compilation or derivative work do not constitute one work but rather are separate works, if the court in its discretion concludes that they are distinct works having independent economic value.

Requires the Attorney General to ensure that: (1) any unit in the Department of Justice responsible for investigating computer hacking or intellectual property crimes is assigned at least one agent to support such unit for the purpose of investigating crimes relating to the theft of intellectual property; and (2) each such agent has received appropriate training.</summary>
