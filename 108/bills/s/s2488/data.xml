  <summary date="2004-12-16T16:05:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Marine Debris Research and Reduction Act - Establishes within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a Marine Debris Prevention and Removal Program of certain activities and grants for projects to reduce and prevent the occurrence and adverse impacts of marine debris on the marine environment and navigation safety. Requires the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of the Department of Commerce to: (1) undertake marine debris mapping, impact assessment, prevention, and removal efforts, with a focus on marine debris posing a threat to living marine resources (particularly endangered or protected species) and navigation safety; (2) improve efforts and actively seek to prevent and reduce commercial fishing gear losses, as well as to reduce adverse impacts of such gear on living marine resources and navigation safety; and (3) undertake outreach and education of stakeholders in the fishing, gear manufacturers, and other marine-dependent industries on threats associated with marine debris and approaches to identify, prevent, and remove such debris.

Directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to undertake measures to reduce violations of MARPOL Annex V (Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973) and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships with respect to the discard of plastics and other garbage from vessels.

Establishes an Interagency Committee on Marine Debris to: (1) coordinate a comprehensive program of marine debris research and activities among Federal agencies, in cooperation with nongovernmental organizations, industry, universities, State governments, Indian tribes, and other nations; and (2) foster cost-effective mechanisms to identify, reduce, and prevent marine debris.</summary>
