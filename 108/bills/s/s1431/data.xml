Prohibits the transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon except through a licensed dealer or a State or local law enforcement agency, subject to specified requirements. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish and maintain a record of the make, model, and date of manufacture of any semiautomatic assault weapon which the Attorney General is made aware has been used in relation to a crime, and of the nature and circumstances of the crime involved; and (2) annually submit the record to Congress and make the record available to the public.

Prohibits: (1) the transfer of any assault weapon with an large capacity ammunition feeding device; and (2) a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer who transfers such a a device that was manufactured on or before September 13, 1994, from failing to certify to the Attorney General, within 60 days of the transfer date, that the device was manufactured on or before that date. Sets penalties for violations.

Prohibits: (1) the transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon or a large capacity ammunition feeding device to a juvenile; and (2) the importation of such a device.</summary>
