    "text": "Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2003 - Amends Federal firearms provisions to revise the definition of \"semiautomatic assault weapon\" to include conversion kits (for converting a firearm to a semiautomatic assault weapon) and any semiautomatic rifle or pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and that has any one of the following characteristics, respectively: (1) a folding or telescoping stock, a threaded barrel, a pistol grip, a forward grip, or a barrel shroud; or (2) a second pistol grip, a threaded barrel, a barrel shroud, or the capacity to accept a detachable magazine at a location outside of the pistol grip.\n\nAmends the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act to repeal the sunset provision for the assault weapons ban. Modifies exemptions from the ban to: (1) retain the exemption of any firearm that is manually operated by bolt, pump, level, or slide action, that has been rendered permanently inoperable, or that is an antique firearm; and (2) remove the exemption of specified firearms, or replicas or duplicates, as manufactured on October 1, 1993, any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds, and any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than five rounds in a fixed or detachable magazine.\n\nProhibits the transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon except through a licensed dealer or a State or local law enforcement agency, subject to specified requirements. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish and maintain a record of the make, model, and date of manufacture of any semiautomatic assault weapon which the Attorney General is made aware has been used in relation to a crime, and of the nature and circumstances of the crime involved; and (2) annually submit the record to Congress and make the record available to the public.\n\nProhibits: (1) the transfer of any assault weapon with an large capacity ammunition feeding device; and (2) a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer who transfers such a a device that was manufactured on or before September 13, 1994, from failing to certify to the Attorney General, within 60 days of the transfer date, that the device was manufactured on or before that date. Sets penalties for violations.\n\nProhibits: (1) the transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon or a large capacity ammunition feeding device to a juvenile; and (2) the importation of such a device."
