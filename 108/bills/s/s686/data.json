Modifies provisions pertaining to the renewal of a waiver of the certification requirements for receiving poison control center grants. Allows waivers only so long as the combined number of years of the waiver and the renewal does not exceed five years (current law allows waivers to be renewed for up to three years).(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to assist in the implementation and maintenance of continuous national toxicosurveillance of poison control center data to detect new hazards from various sources, including household products. Allows the Secretary to enter into a competitive grant or contract with a university, academic center, or other professional organization for the collection and analysis of such poison center data.
