  <summary date="2004-10-29T19:42:42Z" status="Passed Senate amended">Executive Branch Financial Accountability Reporting Act of 2004 - Instructs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to list for certain congressional committees: (1) each Federal entity that receives an exemption or waiver from the statutory requirement for an annually audited financial statement; and (2) other Federal entities, including special purpose entities, that do not prepare independently audited annual financial statements.

Requires the OMB report to include assessments of: (1) the capability of the listed entities to prepare annual financial statements and have them independently audited; (2) how to reduce the costs of preparing the financial statements and performing independent audits; and (3) the benefits of improved financial oversight encompassing the executive branch, including the feasibility of preparing annual financial statements and independently audited statements for certain executive branch entities.
