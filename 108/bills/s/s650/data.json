    "text": "Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require license applications for new drugs and biological products to assess such drug's or product's safety and effectiveness for relevant pediatric subpopulations, including dosage.\n\nPermits deferral of such assessments under specified circumstances, including if the Secretary of Health and Human Services finds that the drug or biological product is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete. Permits full waiver of such assessments under certain conditions, including if: (1) studies are highly impractical or impossible; or (2) there is no meaningful therapeutic advantage or benefit in the pediatric population and the drug or biological product is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. Permits partial waivers at the request of an applicant for a specific pediatric subpopulation if any of the full waiver grounds apply to that subpopulation or reasonable attempts for a pediatric formulation for that subpopulation have failed.Requires labels to provide indication in cases in which a waiver has been granted due to evidence a product would be unsafe or ineffective in pediatric populations. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to specify a date for submission of pediatric assessments if: (1) the drug or biological product would represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit for pediatric patients for one or more claimed indications and the absence of adequate labeling could pose significant risks to pediatric patients; or (2) it is used for a substantial number of pediatric patients for the labeled indications and the absence of adequate labeling could pose significant risks to pediatric patients. Sets forth criteria for full waiver and partial waivers of such requirement. Requires labels to provide indication in cases in which a waiver has been granted due to evidence a product would be unsafe or ineffective in pediatric populations. Requires the Secretary to issue a written request for related pediatric studies under the Public Health Service Act or under this Act before requiring an assessment for a drug. Directs the Secretary, after determining that there is no agreement to such a written request, to certify whether the Secretary has sufficient funds to conduct the study under the Public Health Service Act, taking into account prioritization of drugs for which pediatric studies are needed. States that if a person fails to submit an assessment under this Act, or a request for approval of a pediatric formulation, the relevant drug or biological product may be considered misbranded solely because of that failure and subject to relevant enforcement action. Provides that the new authority under this Act to require pediatric studies shall only remain in effect so long as the pediatric exclusivity provisions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also remain in effect (until October 1, 2007). (Sec. 4) Declares that the provisions of this Act pertaining to research into pediatric uses for new drugs and biological products shall apply to license applications for such drugs and products submitted to the Secretary on or after April 1, 1999. Specifies procedures for the treatment of applications submitted between April 1, 1999, and the date of the enactment of this Act with respect to which waivers or deferrals were granted under previous regulations and with respect to which no waivers or deferrals were granted."
