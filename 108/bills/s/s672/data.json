    "text": "Mandatory Prison Work and Drug Testing Act of 2003 - Amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to require inmates confined in Federal prisons to engage in: (1) work for not less than 50 hours weekly; (2) job training; and (3) educational and life skills preparation study. Allows the services of inmates to be made available to nonprofit entities.Prescribes the portions of an inmate's earned wages to be allocated to offset the cost of incarceration, for victim restitution, to be held for the inmate until release in a non-interest bearing account, to be paid directly to the inmate for mandatory expenses and daily basic needs while incarcerated, and to be distributed to certain States and local jurisdictions.Requires: (1) the establishment of a zero tolerance policy for drug use in the Federal prison system, including random drug testing of inmates and prison employees, routine sweeps for contraband, and residential drug treatment programs for all inmates; and (2) the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that Federal prisoners do not use or possess tobacco, possess or view sexually explicit materials, possess televisions (unless provided by the prison for group viewing), listen to music containing violent or certain other types of lyrics, view cable television which is not educational, and engage in sexual activity.Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to direct the Attorney General to make incentive grants to eligible States and local governments to establish drug-free prisons and jails.Requires the Bureau of Prisons to place in a shock incarceration program any person who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment (current law permits program placement for a consenting person sentenced to imprisonment for 12 to 30 months)."
