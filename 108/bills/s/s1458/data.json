Replaces the opt-out requirements governing such a disclosure with a prohibition against denial of a financial service or product to any consumer based upon the consumer's refusal to grant consent to nonpublic personal information disclosure. Requires each financial institution to designate a privacy compliance officer to ensure compliance with privacy requirements. Sets forth civil penalties for noncompliance."
