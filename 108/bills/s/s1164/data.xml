  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Abrupt Climate Change Research Act of 2003 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish within the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and carry out a scientific research program on abrupt climate change. Lists as purposes of the program: (1) to develop a global array of terrestrial and oceanographic indicators of paleoclimate in order to sufficiently identify and describe past instances of abrupt climate change; (2) to improve understanding of thresholds and nonlinearities in geophysical systems related to the mechanisms of abrupt climate change; (3) to incorporate such mechanisms into advanced geophysical models of climate change; and (4) to test the output of such models against an improved global array of records of past abrupt climate changes.</summary>
