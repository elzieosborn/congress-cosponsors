The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nPublic Broadcasting Reauthorization Act of 2004 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize appropriations for: (1) FY 2007 through 2011 for the Public Broadcasting Fund, including funds for FY 2005 through 2009 specifically for transition from the use of analog to digital technology for the provision of public telecommunication services and for acquisition or production of digital programming of local, regional, and national interest; (2) FY 2005 for the Satellite Interconnection Fund, including for FY 2006 through 2008 up to the amount authorized for FY 2005 if the amount appropriated is less; and (3) FY 2005 through 2011 for public telecommunications facilities programs, including analog and digital broadcast facilities and equipment.\n\nProvides for recoupment by the Public Broadcasting Corporation of unexpended funds from a public broadcast station that ceases to provide public telecommunications services, or transfers its license or permit to an entity that will not provide such services.\n\nRedefines \"public broadcast services\" as \"public telecommunications services,\" namely noncommercial educational and cultural: (1) radio and television programming or other content; and (2) instructional or informational material (including data) transmitted electronically.\n\nRevises the authority of licensees and permittees of public radio stations to use funds distributed by the Corporation at their discretion for purposes related primarily to the production and acquisition of programming. Authorizes such recipients to use such funds primarily for the support of content, programming, and services, especially those that serve the needs and interests of the recipient's local community."
