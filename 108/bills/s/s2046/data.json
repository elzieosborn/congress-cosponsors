    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on July 7, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAmends the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire from one or more willing sellers not more than ten acres of land located outside the boundary of Everglades National Park and adjacent to or near the East Everglades area of the Park for the development of administrative, housing, maintenance, or other Park purposes. Requires such land, on acquisition, to be administered as part of the Park in accordance with the laws (including regulations) applicable to the Park.\n\nDirects the Administrator of General Services to convey to Miami-Dade County, Florida, fee title to approximately 595.28 acres of land designated as Site Alpha that is declared by the Department of the Navy to be excess land in exchange for conveyance by the County to the Secretary of fee title to two parcels of land owned by the County totaling approximately 152.93 acres that are designated as Tract 605-01 and Tract 605-03.\n\nDirects the Secretary, after the completion of such exchange, to convey to the South Florida Water Management District fee title to approximately 1,054 acres of land located in the Rocky Glades area of the Park in exchange for fee title to approximately 1,054 acres of District land located in the Southern Glades Wildlife and Environmental Area.\n\nRequires that the use of the conveyed land to the District be used by the District for the purposes of the C-111 project, including restoration of the Everglades natural system. (The C-111 Spreader Canal project modifies the existing water management system to restore historic freshwater flows to areas of the Everglades National Park and to maintain existing flood protection for surrounding areas.)\n\nAmends Federal law relating to the Big Cypress National Preserve and the Big Cypress National Preserve Addition to: (1) provide for the reduction in the amount of payment or reimbursement by the Secretary of total costs to the State of Florida of acquiring lands within Big Cypress National Preserve Addition by an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the total cost incurred by the Secretary in acquiring lands in the Addition other than from the State; and (2) remove the requirement for reducing the aggregate cost to the United States of acquiring lands within the Addition by an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the total cost incurred by the Secretary in acquiring lands in the Addition other than from the State."
