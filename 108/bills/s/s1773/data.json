(Thus not counting toward net operating loss and tax credit carryover limitations.)\n\nDefines: (1) \"biomedical research corporation\" as a domestic corporation not in bankruptcy which has a drug or biologic in certain clinical trials; and (2) \"qualified investment\" as a stock acquisition in a biomedical research corporation acquired in cash at its original issue.\n\nRequires a biomedical research corporation to meet a five-year expenditure test with respect to any qualified investment."
