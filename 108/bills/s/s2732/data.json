Requires the Administrator in providing such grants to give priority to rural LEAs that: (1) are transporting students in a bus manufactured before 1977; (2) have a grossly depleted fleet of school buses; or (3) serve a school that is required by law to provide transportation to students to enable them to transfer to another public school served by the rural LEA."
