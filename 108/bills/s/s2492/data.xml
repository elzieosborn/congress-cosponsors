  <summary date="2004-07-07T19:07:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Improving Access to Nurse-Midwife Care Act of 2004 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide for the coverage of and payment for certified midwife services (currently only certified nurse-midwife services are covered) under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance). Declares that nothing precludes certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives from teaching or supervising an intern or resident-in-training.

Authorizes payment for such services to a person or entity (or the agent of such person or entity) the certified nurse-midwife (CNM) or certified midwife (CM) may designate under an agreement between the CNM or CM and such person or entity (by implication, including a free-standing birth center).</summary>
