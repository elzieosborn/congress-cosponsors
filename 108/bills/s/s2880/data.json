    "text": "Medical Device Competition Act of 2004 - Amends title XI of the Social Security Act with respect to competition in the medical device and hospital supply industries.\n\nAdds a new requirement to the criteria for exemption from criminal penalties for illegal remunerations accorded to any amount paid by a vendor of goods or services to a person authorized to act as a purchasing agent for a group of individuals or entities who are furnishing services reimbursed under a Federal health care program. Requires, in addition to a written contract specifying the amount to be paid, and service provider disclosure of the amount received from a vendor, that: (1) the contracting, business, and ethical practices of the purchasing agent be not inconsistent with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (2) the purchasing agent be certified to be in compliance with such regulations; and (3) the amount to be paid the purchasing agent does not exceed a total of three percent of the purchase price of the goods or services provided by that vendor.\n\nDirects the Secretary to promulgate regulations specifying the contracting, business, and ethical practices of an authorized purchasing agent that are contrary to antitrust law and competitive principles, to ethical standards, or to the goal of ensuring that products necessary for proper patient care or worker safety are readily available to physicians, health care workers, and patients."
