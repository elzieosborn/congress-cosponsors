Requires an agency head to notify OPM of any categories of employees that would not be covered under such rates. Requires a pay rate conversion for employees moving to a different locality. Considers the locality pay rate as basic pay for purposes of Federal benefits. Determines the rates of pay for employees entitled to pay retention.Requires each agency head to evaluate its agency training with respect to success in accomplishing performance plans and strategic goals, appoint a training officer, and establish a comprehensive management succession program.Authorizes annual leave for qualified non-Federal service of newly hired Federal employees."
