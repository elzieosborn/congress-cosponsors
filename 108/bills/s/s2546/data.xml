  <summary date="2004-10-20T18:09:12Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Genetically Engineered Foods Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a producer to obtain pre-market approval before introducing any genetically engineered food into interstate commerce. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set forth regulations governing the approval process, including requirements for the approval of split use food (defined as genetically engineered food that could be used by both humans and animals, but is not marketed to humans).

Requires the Secretary to provide public notice, make the application and supporting material available to the public, and provide for public comment for genetically engineered foods and animals. Allows the Secretary to protect trade secrets under certain circumstances.

Requires the Secretary to establish: (1) programs to conduct testing to detect the presence of genetically engineered ingredients in foods; (2) programs to monitor the safety of approved genetically engineered foods; and (3) a public registry of such foods.

Requires genetically engineered animals and genetic engineering techniques intended to be used to produce animals to meet the same requirements for approval as new animal drugs.

Requires the Secretary to conduct environmental assessments to evaluate the potential effects of such genetically engineered animals.

Deems genetically engineered animals or foods that are not approved to be adulterated.

Sets forth provisions for the approval of any genetic engineering technique or any genetically engineered food or animal that entered into interstate commerce before enactment of this Act.</summary>
