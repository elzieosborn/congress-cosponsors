  <summary date="2004-07-12T19:32:19Z" status="Passed Senate amended">Recreational Fee Authority Act of 2004 - (Sec. 2) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, beginning on January 1, 2006, to establish, modify, charge, and collect fees for: (1) admission to a unit of the National Park System (NPS); and (2) the use of National Park Service administered areas, lands, sites, facilities, and services by individuals and/or groups.

 Requires fees to be based on an analysis of specified factors, including: (1) the benefits and services provided to the visitor; (2) the cumulative effect of fees; (3) the comparable fees charged elsewhere and by other public agencies and by nearby private sector operators; (4) the direct and indirect cost and benefit to the Government; (5) public policy or management objectives served; and (6) economic and administrative feasibility of fee collection.

 Directs the Secretary to establish the minimum number of fees and avoid the collection of multiple or layered fees. Requires: (1) the results of the analysis together with the Secretary's determination of appropriate fee levels to be transmitted to Congress at least three months prior to publication of such fees in the Federal Register; and (2) proposed new fees or changes to be published in the Federal Register and prohibits them from taking effect for 12 months after the date the notice is published.

Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into agreements, beginning on January 1, 2006, with public or private entities to provide visitor reservation services and fee collection and/or processing services; (2) provide discounted or free admission days or use, modify the National Park Passport, and provide information to the public about various fee programs and program costs and benefits; and (3) enter into revenue sharing agreements with State agencies, effective January 1, 2006, to accept their annual passes for NPs units within the State.

(Sec. 3) Requires, without further appropriation, all receipts collected pursuant to this Act or from sales of the Passport to be retained by the Secretary and permits expenditure of such sums as follows: (1) 80 percent of amounts collected at a specific area, site, or project (area) shall remain available for use at the specific area, except for those NPS units that participate in an active revenue sharing agreement with a State (in which case not less than 90 percent of amounts collected at a specific area shall remain available for use); (2) the balance of the amounts collected shall remain available for use by the National Park Service on a Service-wide basis; (3) monies generated as a result of revenue sharing agreements may provide for a fee-sharing arrangement (with the Service shares of fees being distributed equally to all NPS units in the specific States that are parties to the agreement); and (4) not less than 50 percent of the amounts collected from the sale of the Passport shall remain available for use at the specific area at which the fees were collected and the balance of the receipts shall be distribution as specified.

(Sec. 4) Provides that amounts available for expenditure at a specific area shall be accounted for separately and may be used for: (1) repair, maintenance, facility enhancement, media services and infrastructure including projects and expenses relating to visitor enjoyment, visitor access, environmental compliance, and health and safety; (2) interpretation, visitor information, visitor service, visitor needs assessments, monitoring, and signs; (3) habitat enhancement, resource assessment, preservation, protection, and restoration related to recreation use; and (4) law enforcement relating to public use and recreation.

Limits the Secretary to using 15 percent of total revenues to administer the recreation fee program including direct operating or capital costs, cost of fee collection, notification of fee requirements, direct infrastructure, fee program management costs, bonding of volunteers, startup costs, and analysis and reporting on program accomplishments and effects.

(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary, on January 1, 2009, and every three years thereafter, to submit to Congress a report detailing the status of the Recreation Fee Program conducted in NPS units, including: (1) an evaluation of the Program conducted at each unit; (2) a description of projects that were funded, work accomplished, and future projects and programs for funding with fees; and (3) any recommendations for changes in the overall fee system.</summary>
