Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, in developing such program, to: (1) in close cooperation with the Office for Domestic Preparedness, conduct research and development of new technologies, surveys and reviews of available appropriate technologies, and tests, evaluations, and demonstrations of new and available technologies that significantly improve the capability of law enforcement agencies in countering terrorist threats; (2) in support of such activities, consult with State and local law enforcement agencies and others, work with the National Institute for Standards and Technology and any other office or agency, and enter into agreements and coordinate with other Federal agencies to maximize the effectiveness of the technologies, equipment, and information; and (3) provide a comprehensive list of available technologies, equipment, and information to the Office of Domestic Preparedness, which shall administer the technology transfer program.\n\n Requires the Director of the Office for Domestic Preparedness, in coordination with the Under Secretary, to: (1) make counterterrorism technology, equipment, and information available to State and local law enforcement agencies based on the list of available technologies, equipment, and information and the needs identified by the technology transfer advisory committee established by this Act; (2) consult with State and local law enforcement agencies; (3) accept applications from State and local law enforcement agencies that wish to acquire such technologies, equipment, and information to improve their homeland security capabilities and review such applications with the advisory committee; and (4) transfer the approved technology, equipment, and information and provide training to the State or local law enforcement agencies to implement such technology equipment, and information.\n\n\n\nAllows the Director, upon approval of the Secretary, to expand the program to first responders other than law enforcement agencies and to revise the advisory committee accordingly.\n\nLimits expenditures for administrative costs to ten percent of the program budget.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations."
