    "text": "Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Energy Act of 2003 - George E. Brown, Jr. and Robert S. Walker Hydrogen Future Act of 2003 - Reauthorizes through FY 2010 and revises the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to emphasize fuel cell research, development, and demonstration activities.\n\n\n\nRenames the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Technical Advisory Panel.\n\nDirects the President shall establish an interagency task force to coordinate Federal hydrogen and fuel cell energy activities.\n\n\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy to conduct a public education program designed to increase public interest in and acceptance of hydrogen energy and fuel cell technologies.\n\nMandates implementation of pilot projects to demonstrate the viability of: (1) fuel cells and associated hydrogen fueling infrastructure; (2) hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen fueling infrastructure along major transportation routes or in entire regions; and (3) fuel cells and associated hydrogen fueling infrastructure in foreign countries. Requires a program of demonstration projects to test the technical and commercial viability of hydrogen production from renewable resources.\n\nAmends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to direct the Secretary to revise Federal building energy efficiency performance standards to require the use of fuel cells as a primary power source in new Federal buildings.\n\nAmends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to prescribe increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles in Federal fleets from ten percent in FY 2007 up to 75 percent in FY 2013.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide as a credit against tax for: (1) acquisition of fuel cell and hydrogen motor vehicles; (2) installation of qualified hydrogen-fuel vehicle refueling property; (3) retail sale of hydrogen fuel as motor vehicle fuel; and (4) expenditures for energy-efficient building property, both business and nonbusiness."
