The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow aliens eligible for diversity visas to remain eligible beyond the fiscal year in which they applied. Provides that such visas shall be counted against the worldwide diversity immigrant level for the fiscal year of selection, except for applications properly filed in FY 2003 for which visas shall be deemed available.\n\nMakes this amendment applicable to immigrant visas available for FY 2004 and subsequent years, and allows for retroactive application to FY 1998 in those cases where the alien applicant or the Government moves to reopen the alien's case."
