    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported in the Senate on February 11, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Noxious Weed Control Act of 2003 - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to provide financial assistance through States to eligible weed management entities to control or eradicate weeds. Requires the Secretary, in developing such Program, to consult with the National Invasive Species Council, the Invasive Species Advisory Committee, and representatives from certain States and Indian tribes and public and private entities.(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary to allocate funds to States, on the basis of specified criteria, to fund the carrying out by weed management entities of approved projects to control or eradicate weeds. Requires the provision of special consideration for States with approved weed management entities established by tribes, and allows an additional allocation to a State to meet the particular needs and projects that such a weed management entity will address.(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to prescribe requirements for applications by States for funding. Requires States to select projects for funding to a weed management entity on a competitive basis, considering various factors, including: (1) the seriousness of the noxious weed problem; (2) the likelihood that the project will prevent or resolve the problem or increase knowledge about resolving similar problems; (3) the extent to which the weed management entity has made progress in addressing noxious weed problems; and (4) whether the project will reduce the total population of a noxious weed within a State.Establishes reporting requirements for grant recipients and States. Limits the Federal share of any project or activity approved by a State or Indian tribe under this Act to 50 percent, with exceptions to meet the needs of underserved areas or to address critical needs.(Sec. 6) Requires the consent of the landowner for any activity carried out under this Act involving real property. Prohibits any project from being undertaken on property that is used for the cultivation of row crops, fruits, or vegetables.Permits a weed management entity to carry out a project to address the noxious weed problem of more than one State only if the entity meets the requirements of the State laws in all States in which the project will occur.Prohibits the use of funding under this Act to carry out projects to: (1) control or eradicate animal pests or submerged or floating noxious aquatic weeds; or (2) protect an agricultural commodity other than livestock or an animal- or insect-based product.(Sec. 7) States that the assistance authorized under this Act is meant to supplement, and not replace, other assistance available for control or eradication of harmful, invasive weeds on public and private lands.(Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 through 2007. Limits to five percent the amount of funding made available for a fiscal year for administrative costs of Federal agencies."
