    "text": "Universal Access to Affordable Health Insurance for all Americans Act of 2004 - Directs the Office of Personnel Management to: (1) administer a health insurance program for non-Federal employees; and (2) enter into contracts with carriers to make health benefits plans available to eligible individuals. Allows the Office to require carriers to offer such a plan to be eligible to enter into a contract for a Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) plan.\n\nProhibits individuals from joining the plan that are: (1) 65 years of age or older; (2) eligible to enroll for coverage under a public health insurance program; (3) eligible to enroll in a FEHB plan; or (4) members of the uniformed services.\n\nAllows rates charged and premiums paid for such a plan to differ among geographic regions.\n\nProhibits any Government contribution to such plans.\n\nRequires the Office to keep individuals under such plans in a separate risk pool from individuals covered under a FEHB plan.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for refundable credits for payments made to such plans. Provides for full credit for those below the poverty line, and gradually decreasing credit based on individual income. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make advance payments to such a plan on behalf of an enrollee equal to the Secretary's estimate of the amount of credit allowable for the enrollee."
