Directs the Secretary to also accept a relinquishment of irrevocable prioritized selections from Newtok for those validly selected lands not yet conveyed to Newtok.Requires the Secretary, in exchange for the lands from Newtok, to convey to Newtok the surface and subsurface estate of specified Federal lands. Directs the Secretary, after the interim conveyance, to survey the Federal lands at no cost to Newtok and to issue a patent to such lands subject to the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 and this Act.Declares that land conveyed to Newtok under this Act shall be deemed to have been conveyed under ANCSA, with specified provisions of ANCSA concerning patents not to apply to such lands. States that, consistent with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, such lands shall not be considered part of the Yukon National Wildlife Refuge.Includes the Newtok lands conveyed to the United States in the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, except that residents of the village of Newtok, Alaska, shall retain access rights guaranteed under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act for subsistence fishing, hunting, and gathering.Entitles the Calista Corporation to an equivalent acreage of in-lieu subsurface entitlement for the relinquished Newtok selections to the extent that Calista subsurface rights are affected by this Act.</summary>
