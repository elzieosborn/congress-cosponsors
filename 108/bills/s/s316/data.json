    "text": "Chance to Succeed Act of 2003 - Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to include as a work activity satisfactory participation in services to address barriers designed to improve future employment opportunities, including substance abuse treatment, occupational therapy, physical rehabilitation, and mental health, mental retardation and developmental disabilities services.Requires the assessment for each assistance recipient to determine whether the recipient has any barriers to employment or program compliance.Prohibits a State to which a TANF grant is made from imposing a sanction against an individual or family on the basis of noncompliance with a program requirement: (1) unless the State satisfies specified notice and review requirements; or (2) if the individual whose conduct is the basis of the sanction is in the uncompleted process of being screened or assessed for a mental health problem, disability, substance abuse problem, or sexual or domestic violence situation, or if the services outlined in the service plan developed for the individual or family were not offered, available, and accessible to the individual or family at the time of the noncompliance.Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting a State in compliance with the requirements of this Act from imposing a sanction for noncompliance with work requirements against an individual or family who opts to not take full advantage of the opportunity for assessment or the services and supports made available to ensure that the individual or family can comply with program requirements if such an individual or family is not complying with the State's work requirements.Requires each State receiving a State family assistance grant to establish an advisory panel to review the efficacy of each TANF-funded program."
