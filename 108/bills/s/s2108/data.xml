  <summary date="2004-07-13T17:33:54Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Menu Education and Labeling Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require restaurants that are a part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same trade name to disclose: (1) in a statement adjacent to each menu item or food listing, the number of calories, grams of saturated fat plus trans fat, and milligrams of sodium in a food serving; and (2) other information designed to enable the public to understand the significance of the nutrition information provided in the context of a total daily diet. Exempts condiments, items placed on a table or salad bar for general use, daily specials, temporary menu items, and irregular menu items from these requirements.

Requires restaurants that sell self-serve food, such as through salad bars or buffet lines, to place a sign that lists the number of calories per standard serving adjacent to the name of the food offered. Requires restaurants or vending machine operators to provide a conspicuous sign identifying, and disclosing the number of calories of, each item of food offered in vending machines.

Permits retail food establishments to voluntarily provide, and States to require, additional nutritional information.</summary>
