  <summary date="2004-08-25T17:54:54Z" status="Introduced in Senate">NIH Security Act - Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish a permanent police force, to be known as the National of Institutes of Health Police, to perform law enforcement, security, and investigative functions for property under the jurisdiction, custody, and control of, or occupied by, NIH. Permits officers in such force to be appointed without regard to the standard maximum age limits under Federal law, with officers appointed above a standard maximum age limit not counted as law enforcement officers for purposes of retirement benefits.

Authorizes NIH Police officers to: (1) carry firearms; (2) serve warrants and subpoenas; (3) make arrests; (4) conduct investigations within the United States; and (5) protect within the United States the Director and other NIH officials as authorized by the Director. Allows NIH Police officers to exercise such powers on all NIH properties and on other properties occupied by NIH, as determined by the Director. Confers upon NIH Police the same pay and benefits as provided to other Federal law enforcement officers.</summary>
