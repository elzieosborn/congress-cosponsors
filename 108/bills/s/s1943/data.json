Terminates individual payments for weeks beginning after December 31, 2004.\n\nIncreases to 26 weeks an eligible individual's TEUC payments. Provides for an additional seven weeks of payments, for a total of 33 weeks, for individuals in high-unemployment States (TEUC-X). (Current law provides 13 weeks of regular TEUC payments, with an additional 13 and total 26 in TEUC-X States.)\n\nRevises requirements for determining TEUC-X States, using certain triggers based on insured unemployment rates and on total unemployment rates.\n\nProvides for temporary State authority to waive application of certain look-back provisions under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.\n\nAmends the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to provide a temporary increase in extended unemployment benefits."
