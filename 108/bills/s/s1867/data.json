    "text": "National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act of 2003 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require beverage brand owners (manufacturers or importers of beverages sold in containers) to implement effective redemption, transportation, processing, marketing, and reporting systems for the reuse and recycling of their used beverage containers. Prohibits the sale of a beverage in a beverage container unless a clear refund value statement prominently appears on the container. Requires each brand owner to submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency a recycling management plan subject to the Administrator's approval and a fee to cover administrative costs. Requires sellers of beverages to collect from each purchaser at the time of sale a deposit no greater than a specified minimum refund value and pay the refund value upon container returns either in cash or in the form of a voucher. Establishes a redemption rate performance standard and penalties for failure to achieve such rate. Requires arbitration to settle disputes between a brand owner and a return site. Imposes penalties for violations of this Act."
