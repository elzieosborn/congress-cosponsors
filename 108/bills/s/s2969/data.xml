  <summary date="2004-11-18T15:47:34Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fair Gift Card Act - States it is unlawful for any person to impose a dormancy fee, inactivity charge or fee, or a service fee with respect to a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card.

Exempts from this prohibition any such charge or fee if: (1) the certificate or card has a remaining value of $5 or less at the time the charge or fee is assessed; (2) the charge or fee does not exceed $1; (3) there has been no activity with respect to the certificate or card for at least the last 24 months; (4) the holder of the certificate or the card may reload or add value to the certificate or the card; and (5) specified charge or fee disclosure requirements have been met.

Declares it is unlawful to sell or issue a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card that is subject to an expiration date unless the date is not less than five years from the date the card is purchased and the expiration terms are prominently disclosed in specified font size and in all capital letters.

States that a violation of this Act shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act.</summary>
