  <summary date="2004-12-02T21:06:14Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Clinical Research Act of 2004 - Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to award clinical research support grants to eligible academic health centers to: (1) defray the costs of unfunded Federal requirements for the protection of human research costs; and (2) support activities leading to innovative ways to meets such requirements in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Requires that health centers receive a proportionate share of the total grant money awarded based on the amount invested by the grantee in clinical research compared to the total clinical research investment of all grantees.

Allows the Director to award clinical research infrastructure grants to eligible academic health centers for: (1) necessary infrastructure to facilitate the transfer of new understandings of disease mechanisms gained in the laboratory into the development of new methodologies for diagnosis, therapy, and prevention; (2) the initial testing of human subjects; and (3) addressing obstacles impeding the expeditious application of new science, including a lack of up-to-date information technology systems and a shortage of willing participants.

Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make up to five grants to eligible academic health centers to form partnerships between the centers involved and health care providers for carrying out clinical human subject research to demonstrate how academic research centers may collaborate with the practicing health care community in such research.</summary>
