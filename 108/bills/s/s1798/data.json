Requires the registry to include: (1) a list of manufacturers producing fire-retardant chemicals for sale or use in or on Commission-regulated products sold or used in the United States; (2) a list of such chemicals for each manufacturer; (3) a ranking of sales of such chemicals by each manufacturer measured by volume of chemicals sold; and (4) a list of studies and reports on the human impact of such chemicals performed by those manufacturers.\n\nRequires the Commission to submit an annual report to Congress on the results of the registry.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations."
