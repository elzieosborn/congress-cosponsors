  <summary date="2004-01-20T20:03:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that the Taiwanese people, and not the Government of the People's Republic of China, should: (1) have exclusive responsibility for determining the future of Taiwan; and (2) be able to conduct referenda on issues that will have a direct effect on their quality of life, free from intimidation or threat of force.

Urges the United States to support Taiwan as a blossoming democracy, including its adoption of such democratic practices as the use of referenda votes.

Urges the United States to: (1) continue to be a strong supporter of Taiwanese membership in the World Health Organization (WHO); and (2) raise the issue of Taiwanese referenda votes, and membership in the WHO, at future meetings with Chinese officials.</summary>
