  <summary date="2003-09-08T21:29:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Keeping the Social Security Promise Initiative - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. Government promise of Social Security benefits under title II of the Social Security Act must be honored, and management and control of Social Security by the Federal Government must not be relinquished, and therefore Congress rejects any effort to privatize Social Security; and (2) the President and the Congress should join to develop legislation to strengthen Social Security as soon as possible, which should recognize the obstacles women face in securing financial stability at retirement or in cases of disability or death, the unique needs of minorities and the role Social Security plays in preventing poverty and providing financial security, and guarantee current law promised benefits without increasing taxes.</summary>
