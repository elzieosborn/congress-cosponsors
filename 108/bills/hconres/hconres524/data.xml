  <summary date="2004-11-23T20:54:48Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on November 19, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to make certain corrections in the enrollment of H.R. 1350 (Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004).

Continues provision of free educational materials, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), for visually impaired and print disabled students, not only in educational and secondary schools, but also in postsecondary and graduate schools.

Requires States eligible under IDEA to ensure that all special education teachers in elementary, middle, and secondary schools are highly qualified by the end of the 2005-6 schoolyear (which is the current deadline for all teachers teaching in core academic subjects in a State to be highly qualified, under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).</summary>
