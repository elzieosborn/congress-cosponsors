  <summary date="2004-04-08T19:53:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Urges oil-producing countries that are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase their oil production in order to offset OPEC's efforts to increase oil prices and revenue. Recognizes that the people of the United States need to address the issue of domestic oil consumption by considering: (1) the amount of money spent on foreign oil; (2) the purposes for which that money is used by its recipients; and (3) the nation's dependence on oil, specifically on oil from OPEC countries, and its effect on national security.</summary>
