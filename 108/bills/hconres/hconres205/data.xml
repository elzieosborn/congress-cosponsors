  <summary date="2003-09-26T21:16:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses gratitude and commends the Government of Kuwait for its magnanimity in receiving Ali Ismaeel Abbas (who suffered severe burns and lost both arms on March 29, 2003), for providing Ali life-saving medical care and undertaking to provide for his long-term recuperation and rehabilitation, and for providing medical assistance, water, and other humanitarian aid to its neighbors.

Expresses confidence that such humanitarian action will not only help heal the wounds of Ali, but will also restore comity between Kuwait and Iraq and within the region and deepen the friendship between the Kuwaiti peoples and the United States.</summary>
