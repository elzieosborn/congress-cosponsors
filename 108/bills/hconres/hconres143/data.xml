  <summary date="2003-09-08T20:19:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes the necessity to pursue justice and national reconciliation in Iraq through the establishment of a special court or other appropriate tribunal or commission which should adjudicate the cases of those accused of bearing greatest responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including prosecuting Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials, military leaders, and other citizens who may have committed crimes in contravention of the Hague and Geneva Conventions on the laws of war. Considers the International Criminal Court not to be the appropriate forum for the prosecution of such crimes since that court only has jurisdiction to hear cases relating to crimes committed after July 1, 2002.

Calls upon the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to notify Congress of the steps the United States and allied coalition nations are taking to seek justice for the violations of international law against the Iraqi people and others.</summary>
