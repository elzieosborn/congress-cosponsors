  <summary date="2003-09-08T20:14:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Urges the United States to support any proposal that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) play a greater role in fostering security throughout Afghanistan. Declares that Congress believes that NATO can and should participate more fully in increasing the security and stability in Afghanistan to ensure the successful transition, as outlined in the Bonn Agreement of December 5, 2001, to a peaceful and democratic national government, representative of all its peoples, safe and secure with its neighbors, respectful of human rights (particularly women's rights), and a model for other countries. Urges Congress to fully fund the authorization in the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 for the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) with the flexibility to utilize those funds for an expanded ISAF or to support a new NATO role in Afghanistan, or both.</summary>
