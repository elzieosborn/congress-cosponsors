Authorizes the presiding officer of the Senate to suspend any Senate proceeding, including a rollcall vote or a quorum call, and declare a recess or adjournment of the Senate (subject to existing authorities or the call of the Chair) within the limits of the Constitution whenever the presiding officer has been notified of an imminent threat.

Authorizes the majority and minority leaders or their designees, when the Senate is out of session, acting jointly and within the limits of the Constitution, to modify any order for the time or place of the convening of the Senate when, in their opinion, such action is warranted by intervening circumstances.</summary>
