The summary of that version is repeated here.)Amends rule XXII (Precedence of Motions) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to authorize a cloture motion on a nomination requiring the advice and consent of the Senate after such nomination has been pending before the Senate for at least 12 hours. Outlines procedures and limitations on the debate of the nomination after cloture is invoked.Provides that if the Senate fails to invoke cloture on a pending nomination, subsequent cloture motions may be made with respect to the same nomination. Makes it out of order to file subsequent cloture motions on any nomination, except by unanimous consent, until the previous motion has been disposed of. Reduces the affirmative vote (three-fifths, or 60 out of 100) required to invoke cloture on such nomination by three votes on the motion and by three additional votes on each succeeding motion, until the affirmative vote is reduced to a number equal or less than an affirmative vote of a majority of the Senators duly chosen and sworn and after that, a simple majority."
