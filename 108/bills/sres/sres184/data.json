(Sec. 2) Declares the sense of the Senate that the United States should: (1) work to secure the immediate humanitarian release of Dr. Yang Jianli by the Government of the PRC; (2) continue to make every effort to assist Dr. Yang Jianli and his family while discussions of his release are ongoing; (3) ensure that the Government of the PRC understands that the detention of U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens, and the infliction of human rights violations on these groups, will reduce the opportunities for cooperation between the United States and the Government of the PRC; (4) reiterate its deep concern regarding the continued imprisonment of Dr. Yang Jianli and other U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens; (5) engage in discussions with the Government of the PRC regarding the legal status and immediate humanitarian needs of these U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens; and (6) in the context of an ongoing human rights dialogue with the Government of the PRC, seek to develop initiatives in the area of the rule of law, with the goal of bringing the legal system of the PRC into full compliance with international standards."
