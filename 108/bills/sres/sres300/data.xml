  <summary date="2004-03-16T18:05:11Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2004 should not include project earmarks; (2) if earmarked projects are included, the projects should be included within the funding that a State would otherwise receive so as not to penalize other States; and (3) any earmarked projects should be included in the funding equity provisions of the next surface transportation Act so that the projects do not adversely affect the rate of return that a State receives from its contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.</summary>
