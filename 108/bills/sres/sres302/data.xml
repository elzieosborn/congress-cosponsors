  <summary date="2004-03-16T17:59:01Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States should not legitimize or support the elections in Iran scheduled to take place on February 20, 2004, as such elections stifle the growth of the genuine deomocratic forces in Iran and do not serve the national security interest of the United States; (2) the support provided by the United States to Iran should be provided to the people of Iran, and not to any political figure who supports the preservation of the current regime; and (3) the policy of the United States should be to seek a genuine democratic government in Iran that will restore freedom to the people of Iran, will abandon terrorism, will protect human rights, and will live in peace and security with the international community.</summary>
