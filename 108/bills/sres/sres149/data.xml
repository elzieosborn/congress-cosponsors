Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should take the following actions concerning U.S. food assistance programs: (1) review the programs to ensure that needs in Africa are met to the same degree as food needs elsewhere in the world; (2) shift available food assistance resources to meet needs in the Horn of Africa, including by drawdowns of reserve stocks in the Emerson Humanitarian Trust; (3) encourage other donors to commit increased resources; (4) direct the Secretaries of State and of Agriculture and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop with international organizations, other donor countries, and African governments a long-term comprehensive strategy for sustainable recovery in regions affected by food crisis.</summary>
