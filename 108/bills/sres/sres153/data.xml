  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) changes to athletics policies issued under Title IX (of the Education Amendments of 1972) would contradict the spirit and intent of the mandate to provide equal opportunities in athletics; (2) current Title IX athletics policies (as set forth in the regulations issued in 1975) and the Department of Education's 1979 Policy Interpretation (as clarified in the 1996 Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance) should remain unchanged and be enforced vigorously to eliminate the continuing discrimination against women and girls in athletics; and (3) if the Department of Education changes the current Title IX athletics policies, Congress will respond with legislation to restore such policies and preserve the right to equal opportunities in athletics.</summary>
