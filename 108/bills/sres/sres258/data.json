Khodorkovsky is accorded the full measure of his rights under the Russian Constitution to defend himself against any and all charges that may be brought against him; and (2) make every effort to dispel growing international concerns that the cases against Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and other business leaders are politically motivated and that the potential remains for misuse of the Federation's justice system."
