  <summary date="2004-12-23T21:25:15Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

States that the Senate: (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship formed between the United States and Ukraine since the restoration of Ukraine's independence in 1991; and (2) recognizes that a precondition for the full integration of Ukraine into the Western community of nations is its establishment of a genuinely democratic political system.

Urges the Government of Ukraine to: (1) guarantee freedom of association and assembly; (2) meet its Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) commitments on democratic elections; and (3) address issues previously identified by the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in its final reports on the 2002 parliamentary elections and the 1999 presidential elections, such as illegal interference by public authorities in the campaign and a high degree of bias in the media.

Urges the Ukrainian authorities to ensure, among other things, the full transparency of election procedures before, during, and after the second round of the 2004 presidential election and the free access for Ukrainian and international election observers.

Calls upon the Government of Ukraine to guarantee election monitors from the ODIHR, other participating OSCE states, Ukrainian political parties, representatives of candidates, nongovernmental organizations, and other private institutions and organizations, both foreign and domestic, unobstructed access to all aspects of the election process.

Urges the President to: (1) employ fully the diplomatic and other resources of the U.S. Government to encourage the Government of Ukraine to ensure that the election laws and procedures of Ukraine are faithfully adhered to by all local and national officials, by others acting at their behest, and by all candidates and parties, during and subsequent to the presidential campaign and election-day voting; (2) communicate clearly to the Government of Ukraine, and to all parties, candidates, and the people of Ukraine the high importance attached by the U.S. Government to this campaign as a central factor in determining the future relationship between the two countries; and (3) consider visa bans and other targeted sanctions on those responsible for encouraging or participating in any efforts to influence improperly the outcome of the election.

 Pledges the enduring support and assistance of the Senate to the people of Ukraine for establishment of a fully free and open democratic system, creation of a prosperous free market economy, and establishment of a secure independence and freedom from coercion and for Ukraine's assumption of its rightful place as a full and equal member of the Western community of democracies.</summary>
