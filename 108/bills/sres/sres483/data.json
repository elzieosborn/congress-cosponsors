The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nExpresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China is in violation of international human rights standards by detaining and mistreating Tibetans who engage in peaceful activities to protest China's occupation of Tibet or promote the preservation of a distinct Tibetan identity; (2) sustained international pressure on the Government of the People's Republic of China is essential to improve the human rights situation in Tibet and secure the release of Tibetan political prisoners; (3) the Government of the United States should raise the cases of Tenzin Delek and other political prisoners at every opportunity with officials from the People's Republic of China, and work with other governments concerned about human rights in China, including Tibetan areas, to encourage the release of political prisoners and promote systemic improvement of human rights in China; and (4) the Government of the People's Republic of China should release all political prisoners, including Tenzin Delek."
