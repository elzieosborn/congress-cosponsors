The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nExpresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the members of the armed forces and their families have performed courageously and have earned the deep gratitude of the people of the United States; (2) success in Iraq is a global priority and therefore demands cooperation and financial assistance from all states and international organizations; (3) the international community should establish additional police training academies inside and outside of Iraq, contribute additional trainers to those academies, and dedicate experienced police to train Iraq police officers in the field; (4) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is uniquely qualified to meet Iraq's needs for security and stability; (5) NATO member states should contribute additional military and security forces toward such effort; (6) countries unable to contribute security personnel should contribute in other ways as requested by the Iraqi government; (7) countries holding debt incurred under the Saddam Hussein regime should meaningfully reduce such debt; (8) the United States is committed to a free and peaceful Iraq; and (9) it is appropriate to thank coalition partners and other countries that have helped promote security, stability, reconstruction, and democracy in Iraq."
