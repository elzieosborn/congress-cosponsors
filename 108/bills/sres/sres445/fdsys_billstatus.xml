Declares that if one Committee votes to report such a nomination, the other must report within 30 calendar days session, or be automatically discharged.</p> <p><b>Title II: Intelligence Oversight Reform</b> - (Sec. 201) Amends Senate Resolution 400, 94th Congress (establishing the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence) to: (1) provide that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services (if not already a member of the Select Committee) shall be ex officio members of it but shall have no vote in the Committee and shall not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum; and (2) limit its membership to 15 and its membership to be appointed from the Senate at large to seven.</p> <p>Requires the Majority Leader to appoint the Majority Members at large and the Minority Leader to appoint the Minority Members at large, with the Majority having a one vote margin. (Currently, the President pro tempore appoints such Members at large with the recommendations of the Majority and Minority Leaders).</p> <p>Eliminates the: (1) limitation to eight of the number of years a Member may serve on such Committee; and (2) the requirement that one-third of Members appointed to such Committee at the beginning of a Congress be Members who did not serve on it during the preceding Congress. </p> <p>Requires the Majority Leader, at the beginning of each Congress, to select a chairman of the Select Committee and the Minority Leader to select a vice chairman for the Select Committee.</p> <p>Allows the Select Committee to be organized into subcommittees with each having a chairman and a vice chairman selected by the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Select Committee, respectively.</p> <p>Limits the reports to the Senate from the Select Committee to not less than quarterly.</p> <p>Requires the Select Committee, in addition to other committee staff, to hire or appoint: (1) one employee for each of its Members to serve as such Member's designated representative; but (2) only an employee chosen by that Member.

Reduces from 30 to ten days after referral, as well, the deadline and discharge date for the Select Committee to report to the Senate any proposed legislation of a standing committee whose referral it has requested because it contains matter within the Select Committee's jurisdiction. </p> <p>Allows the Majority or Minority Leader (currently, the Senate) to request, before the discharge date, an additional five days on behalf of the appropriate Committee. Provides for automatic discharge of referred proposed legislation from such Committee after the five-day extension.</p> <p>Prohibits committees to which legislation is referred from making changes or alterations to the text of the referred bill and its annexes; but allows them to propose changes or alterations in the form of amendments.</p> <p>Modifies procedures of the Select Committee for public disclosure of classified information submitted to it by the executive branch. Requires the Committee to notify and consult with the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate about a vote to disclose such information, before notifying the President (as under current rules).</p> <p>Authorizes the Select Committee to make public disclosure of such information after a five-day period following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted to the Majority and Minority Leaders and the President (currently, just the President).</p> <p>Authorizes the Majority and Minority Leaders jointly or the Select Committee, by majority vote, to refer the question of such disclosure to the Senate for consideration if the President, personally, in writing, notifies the Majority and Minority Leaders and the Select Committee of his objection to it.</p> <p><b>Title III: Committee Status</b> - (Sec. 301) Treats the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs as the Committee on Governmental Affairs listed under rule XXV (Standing Committees) of the Standing Rules of the Senate for purposes of such Rules.</p> <p><b>Title IV: Intelligence-Related Subcommittees</b> - (Sec. 401) Establishes in the Select Committee on Intelligence a Subcommittee on Oversight responsible for ongoing oversight of intelligence activities.</p> <p></p> <p>(Sec. 402) Establishes in the Committee on Appropriations a Subcommittee on Intelligence with jurisdiction over funding for intelligence matters. Requires the Committee on Appropriations to reorganize into 13 subcommittees as soon as possible after the convening of the 109th Congress.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Title V: Effective Date</b> - Makes this resolution effective on the convening of the 109th Congress.</p>]]></text>
