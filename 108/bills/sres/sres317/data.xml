  <summary date="2004-06-10T19:13:58Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Supports the establishment of April as National Autism Awareness Month.

Recognizes and commends the parents and relatives of children with autism for their sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special needs of such children.

Supports the goal of increasing Federal funding for aggressive research to: (1) learn the root causes of autism; (2) identify the best methods of early intervention and treatment; (3) expand programs for individuals with autism; and (4) promote understanding of the special needs of people with autism.

Commends the Department of Health and Human Services for swift implementation of the Children's Health Act of 2000, particularly for establishing Centers of Excellence for autism-related research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.

Stresses the need for early intervention services after a child has been diagnosed with autism.

Supports the Federal Government's commitment to provide States with 40 percent of the costs needed to educate children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

Recognizes the shortage of appropriately trained teachers to teach special needs students, including those with autism.

Recognizes the importance of worker training programs tailored to the needs of developmentally disabled persons, including those with autism. Notes that people with autism can be productive members of the workforce with appropriate support, training, and early intervention services.</summary>
