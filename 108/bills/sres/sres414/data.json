The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nExpresses support for: (1) bipartisan efforts of Congress, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and State and local law enforcement officers to combat human trafficking and slavery; and (2) efforts to educate and empower State and local law enforcement officers in the identification of victims of human trafficking. Encourages State legislatures to: (1) carefully examine DOJ's model State anti-trafficking criminal statute and the Federal benefits and protections for victims of human trafficking and slavery contained in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; and (2) seriously consider adopting laws that combat human trafficking and slavery, wherever such laws do not currently exist, and that offer such explicit protections to the victims."
