Urges the President to request the United States International Trade Commission, in addition to fulfilling certain monitoring and reporting requirements under the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the progress of workers in a domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition, to monitor and report on the impact that temporary tariff increases and tariff-rate quotas on certain steel imports proclaimed by the President on March 5, 2002, have had on steel-consuming industries and ports of entry in the United States.</summary>
