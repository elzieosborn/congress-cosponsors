(Sec. 102) Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority, outlays, and administrative expenses for Social Security and specified major functional categories for FY 2005 through 2009. Title II: Reconciliation - (Sec. 201) Directs the Senate Committee on Finance to report a reconciliation bill by September 30, 2004, that consists of changes in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to: (1) reduce revenues by no more than $12.311 billion for FY 2005 and $80.642 billion for FY 2005 through 2009; (2) increase outlays by not more than $2 billion for FY 2005 through 2009; and (3) increase the statutory debt limit by $664.028 billion. Title III: Reserve Funds and Adjustments - Subtitle A: Reserve Funds - (Sec. 301) Authorizes the chairman of the Committee on the Budget (Chairman), if the Senate Finance Committee or the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reports legislation that provides health insurance for the uninsured or expands access to care for the uninsured (including legislation to reallocate and maintain expiring State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds rather than allowing them to revert to the Treasury), increases access to health insurance through lowering costs, and does not increase the costs of current health insurance coverage, to revise allocations of new budget authority and outlays, as well as revenue aggregates and other appropriate aggregates to reflect such legislation to establish a reserve fund, provided that the legislation would not increase the deficit for FY 2005 and for FY 2005 through 2009. (Sec. 302) Allows the Chairman, if the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reports legislation that provides funding for reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, to revise committee allocations and other appropriate budgetary aggregates and allocations of new budget authority and outlays by the amount provided by such legislation to establish a reserve fund of up to $1 billion in new budget authority and $1 billion in outlays for FY 2005, and $5 billion in new budget authority and $5 billion in outlays for FY 2005 through 2009.

(Sec. 522) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the levels in this resolution assume that in making appropriations and revenue decisions in Function 600 (Income Security), the Senate supports the provision, to the Food and Nutrition Service and other appropriate agencies within the Department of Agriculture, of $15 million for FY 2005, and $127 million for FY 2005 through 2009, to enable those agencies to expand the summer food pilot projects (established under the Richard B.
