Declares that Congress: (1) recognizes that the enactment of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was an essential step in the development and use of a range of civilian nuclear technologies to the benefit of humanity; (2) commends and remembers the authors of the original Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for their foresight and leadership; and (3) commemorates the role played by President Dwight David Eisenhower in his historic Atoms for Peace speech and the leadership he demonstrated in recognizing 50 years ago that the benefits of nuclear technologies would be realized only through a careful national and international system of control, regulation, and use.</summary>
