The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nStates that Congress: (1) condemns the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and militia groups supported by it for attacks against innocent civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan and demands that the Government of Sudan immediately take actions to cease these attacks; (2) calls on the Government of Sudan to grant full and immediate access to Darfur to humanitarian aid organizations, the human rights investigation and humanitarian teams of the United Nations (UN), and an international monitoring team in compliance with the temporary cease-fire agreement that is based in Darfur and has the support of the United States and the European Union; (3) encourages the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to work with donors to develop a plan to pre-position and deliver humanitarian assistance to Darfur, including a plan for air delivery of food; (4) calls on the Secretary of State to develop a plan for further bilateral and multilateral action if the Government of Sudan fails to undertake the actions called for in clause (2), including a plan to seek a Security Council resolution addressing the Darfur situation; (5) deplores the inaction of some UN member states and the failure of the United Nations Human Rights Commission to take strong action with respect to Darfur; and (6) urges the President to direct the United States Representative to the United Nations to seek an official UN investigation to determine if crimes against humanity have been committed by the Government of Sudan in Darfur, and work with the international community to ensure that the individuals responsible for crimes against humanity in Darfur are accountable for their actions."
