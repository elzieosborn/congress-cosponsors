  <summary date="2003-12-05T15:32:05Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Deplores the development by Iran of a nuclear weapons program and the failure of the Government of Iran to report material, facilities, and activities to the International Atomic Energy Commission (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)) in contravention of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Concurs with the conclusion of the State Department that Iran is pursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons.

Calls on the President to use all appropriate means to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, with particular attention to the needs of the IAEA for information and access, including information concerning gas centrifuges and the conduct of uranium conversion experiments.

Calls on Russia to suspend all nuclear cooperation with Iran until Iran fully complies with a specified IAEA resolution.

Calls on the United Nations Security Council to consider immediately the passage of a Security Council resolution or the taking of other actions that may be necessary to impose diplomatic and economic sanctions against Iran if it fails to meet its obligations to the IAEA.

Calls on the Government of Iran to cease all efforts to acquire nuclear fuel cycle capabilities until it is able to provide specific assurances that it is not engaged in a clandestine nuclear weapons program.</summary>
