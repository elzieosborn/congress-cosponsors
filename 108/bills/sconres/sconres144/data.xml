Directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to make certain corrections in the enrollment of H.R. 4837 (Military Construction Appropriations and Emergency Hurricane Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2005).

Repeals the requirement that: (1) the Secretary of Agriculture shall use not more than $6.037 billion of the funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out the conservation security program for the period of FY 2005 through 2014; and (2) any savings from that requirement not be scored until FY 2008.

Replaces such requirement with the designation of agricultural disaster assistance under such Act as an emergency requirement.</summary>
