  <summary date="2004-08-05T20:37:56Z" status="Introduced in House">No Child Left Behind Reform Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to revise certain requirements which were added by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, including ones relating to: (1) adequate yearly progress (AYP); (2) academic assessment and local educational agency and school improvement; (3) school choice and supplemental services options; and (4) teacher qualifications.

Allows schools to be given credit for performing well on measures other than test scores when calculating student achievement.

Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to State educational agencies to: (1) develop or increase the capacity of data systems for accountability purposes; and (2) subgrants to increase the capacity of local educational agencies to upgrade, create, or manage information databases for the purpose of measuring AYP.

 Allows schools to target school choice and supplemental services to the students who are members of specified types of groups that fail to make AYP. Requires placement and service in the least restrictive environment for students who receive services under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act who use an option to transfer under ESEA.

Revises the definition of highly qualified teacher to authorize States to: (1) use a generalist exam for middle school teachers; and (2) issue certificates that qualify teachers to teach a number of subjects in social studies or in science.</summary>
