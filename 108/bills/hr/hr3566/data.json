Directs the Secretary to designate a facility in the Ochoco National Forest headquarters within Forest Service Region 6 to address such issues, with particular emphasis on coniferous forest stands in the Western United States.\n\n Directs the Secretary develop an early warning system for catastrophic environmental forest threats."
