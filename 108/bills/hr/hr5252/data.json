Requires the Director to assign to the National Library of Medicine the primary responsibility for operating such databank.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) identify false or misleading information in the databank, correct such information, and make appropriate public notifications; and (2) amend regulations to require institutional review boards to determine the safety or effectiveness of products registered under this Act and deny approval for trials that are not registered.\n\nSpecifies information required for registration of clinical trials, including information important to clinicians or researchers.\n\nSets forth provisions regarding periodic updates of databank information, submission of results of clinical trials, public disclosure of databank information, and violations of this Act.\n\nAmends the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to allow exemptions for clinical investigational use of drugs or devices only if such drugs are registered in accordance with this Act."
