Wichita Project Equus Beds Division Authorization Act of 2004 - Amends a statute providing for the construction of the Cheney division, Witchita Federal reclamation project, Kansas, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to assist in the funding and implementation of the Equus Beds Aquifer Recharge and Recovery Component which is a part of the Integrated Local Water Supply Plan, Wichita, Kansas (Equus Beds Division or EBD).

Makes the operation, maintenance, and replacement of EBD, including funding for those purposes, the sole responsibility of the City of Wichita (the City).

Directs the Secretary to work cooperatively with the City to use plans, designs, and engineering and environmental analyses that have already been prepared by the City for EBD.

Authorizes as the Federal share an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the total cost of EBD or $30 million (January 2003 prices), whichever is less, plus or minus any amounts justified by reason of ordinary fluctuations in construction costs as indicated by engineering cost indexes applicable to the type of construction involved. Makes such sums nonreimbursable.</summary>
