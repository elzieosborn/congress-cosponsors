F) to direct the Secretary of Transportation to maintain in full force and effect certain restrictions imposed under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Notices to Airmen FDC 3/2122, FDC 3/2123, and FDC 2/0199 (relating to restricted airspace). Prohibits the Secretary from granting any waivers or exemptions from such restrictions, except, among other things, to allow the operations of an aircraft participating in an air show in restricted airspace if the Administrator of the FAA determines that the security of an event, stadium, or other venue is not reduced."
