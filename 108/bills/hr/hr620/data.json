Prohibits payments under this Act from coming from: (1) fees under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965; (2) the recreational fee demonstration program; (3) the national park passport program; (4) emergency appropriations for Yosemite flood recovery; and (5) funds appropriated for the Operation of the National Park Service.Amends the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to allow certain facilities to be located outside the boundaries of Yosemite National Park."
