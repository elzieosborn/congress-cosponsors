  <summary date="2004-07-13T17:28:58Z" status="Introduced in House">Remember 9/11 Health Act - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to pay all health care expenses of eligible recipients, including emergency service personnel, cleanup workers, and residents of the declared disaster area, that result from exposure to the adverse conditions after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York City.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants or cooperative agreements to specified programs, including one established by the New York City Fire Department, to carry out screening and clinical examinations and long-term health monitoring and analysis for eligible recipients. Limits such monitoring to 20 years and 40,000 individuals. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a similar program for those affected by the September 11, 2001, Pentagon attack.

Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to conduct or support diagnostic or treatment research for adverse health conditions considered to be associated with the terrorist attacks.

 Requires the Secretary to convene a 9/11 Health Emergency Coordinating Council to examine and formulate recommendations on the adequacy of the: (1) responses by the Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector to the attacks; (2) care and compensation for the victims; (3) Federal tracking of the monitoring and treatment of individuals suffering health effects from the attacks; and (4) coordination among the Council members to the attacks. Allows the Council, upon request, to issue advisory opinions on the relative obligation of the Federal Government and any insurance company resulting from the attacks.</summary>
