  <summary date="2004-10-20T15:29:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Services for Ending Long-Term Homelessness Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the Center for Mental Health Services to: (1) administer the grant program established by this Act; (2) provide technical assistance to entities that provide permanent supportive housing to the chronically homeless; and (3) implement an approach to disseminate information about such housing that is targeted to individuals who have been homeless for long periods and have disabilities. Defines "chronically homeless" as an individual or family that is currently homeless, has been homeless continuously for at least one year or on at least four separate occasions in the last three years, and has an adult head of household with a disabling condition.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to: (1) design national strategies to provide services in supportive housing to end chronic homelessness; (2) collaborate with specified Federal departments and programs to implement programs that address chronic homelessness; (3) develop improved methods for serving individuals with mental or physical illnesses, disabilities, substance abuse problems, or co-occurring disorders; and (4) promote collaboration between Federal, State and local agencies that are responsible for systems of care to ensure that services for the chronically homeless are delivered in a coordinated manner that promotes housing stability.

Requires the Secretary to award matching grants for the provision of services to chronically homeless individuals in permanent supportive housing.</summary>
