Requires the Council for Environmental Quality, in conjunction with the National Invasive Species Council, to develop guidelines for such measures.Establishes within the executive branch the National Invasive Species Council to ensure that Federal agency efforts concerning invasive species are coordinated, effective, complementary, and cost-efficient.Requires the Council to develop a National Invasive Species Management Plan that details and recommends performance-oriented goals.Requires the Council to create the Invasive Species Advisory Committee to provide information and advice for consideration by the Council.Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prepare and submit to Congress and the Council a yearly budget analysis and summary of all Federal programs relating to invasive species."
