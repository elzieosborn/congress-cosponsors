    "text": "Health Security for All Americans Act - Amends the Social Security Act to provide participating States with funding to provide health insurance coverage through State-administered plans targeted at low-income residents.\n\nRequires States to implement systems to ensure universal health insurance coverage for their residents by 2009, including by requiring employers to contribute to health insurance premiums for their employees.\n\nRequires health plans to: (1) create entities to serve as employers for their home care providers; (2) ensure that enrollees will continue to receive health services if the plan's services are terminated; and (3) supply the State with information on their health care workers.\n\nIncorporates the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, as passed by the Senate on June 29, 2001, and the Patient Safety and Health Care Whistleblower Protection Act of 2001, as introduced on June 27, 2001.\n\nEstablishes the Health Care Quality, Patient Safety, and Workforce Standards Institute (and a related advisory committee) within the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality with a mission to demonstrate how patient safety issues and workplace conditions are linked to quality patient care, reduce medical errors, and improve patient safety and care.\n\nRequires that individuals entitled to Medicare benefits be provided full mental health and substance abuse treatment parity.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct research to identify model programs for the provision of long-term and home health care services.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that funds to implement this Act should be offset by: (1) general revenues available as a result of an on-budget surplus for a fiscal year; (2) direct saving in health care expenditures; and (3) reductions in unnecessary Federal tax benefits available to individuals and large corporations in the maximum tax brackets."
