Public school system.\n\nModifies the preference in leasing or purchasing former D.C. Public school property for a public charter school to require the Mayor and the District government to give a right of first offer (currently, first preference), to be annually reinstated with respect to any facility or property not previously disposed of, or under contract to be disposed of, to an eligible applicant or Board of Trustees. Repeals the proviso that the gift of the right of first preference will not result in a significant loss of revenue that might be obtained from other dispositions or uses of the facility or property.\n\nModifies the requirement of the Mayor's jurisdiction over such facility or property. Requires the Mayor to have jurisdiction on the effective date of this Act or the Mayor or any successor agency to gain jurisdiction after such date.\n\nRequires the purchase or lease to: (1) be negotiated by the Mayor; (2) include rent or an acquisition price, as applicable, that is at least 25 percent less than the appraised value of the property (based on use of the property for school purposes); and (3) include a lease period, if the property is to be leased, of not less than 25 years, renewable for additional 25-year periods as long as the eligible applicant or Board of Trustees maintains its charter.\n\nGrants a D.C.

Public school that converts to a public charter school of the option to remain at the charter school during the school's first year of operation after receiving an extended leave of absence, and thereafter at the charter school's sole discretion.\n\nModifies the requirement that the Mayor and the D.C. government give a right of first offer with respect to any facility or property not previously (or under contract to be) disposed of to an eligible applicant whose petition to establish a public charter school is conditionally approved. Repeals the mandatory annual reinstatement of such right. Extends the restriction on the exercise of such right with respect to certain facilities or properties to exclude any facility or property that is: (1) the subject of a previously proposed resolution submitted to the D.C. Council by the Mayor on or before December 1, 2004, seeking authority for disposition of such facility or property; or (2) under an Exclusive Rights Agreement executed on or before such date.\n\nModifies the terms of purchase or lease of such a facility or property to require the Mayor to negotiate in accordance with written rules or regulations as determined by the Mayor, and published in the District of Columbia Register. Repeals the requirement that the rent or acquisition price for such facility or property be at least 25 percent less than its appraised value. Requires, instead, that such rent or acquisition price, as applicable, be at the appraised value of the property, based on its use for school purposes. Grants a D.C. Public school approved to become a conversion public charter school the right to occupy the facilities exclusively under a minimum 25-year lease, renewable for additional 25-year periods as long as the school maintains its charter at the appraised value of the property based on its use for school purposes (in lieu of maintaining its charter at the nonprofit rate, or if there is no nonprofit rate, at 25 percent less than the fair market rate for school use).)\n\n(Sec. 343) Requires an eligible chartering authority to ensure that each public charter school complies with annual reporting requirements, including submission of the audited financial statement.\n\nRequires the annual report of each eligible chartering authority that issues a charter to include: (1) details of major Board actions; (2) major findings from school reviews of academic, financial, and compliance with health and safety standards and resulting Board action or recommendations; (3) details of the fifth year review process and outcomes; and (4) a summary of annual financial audits of all charter schools, including the number of schools that failed to timely submit the required audited financial statement, those whose audits revealed a failure to follow required accounting practices or other material deficiencies and steps taken by the authority to rectify such deficiencies, and the ones which have required intervention by an authorizing board to address any academic or operational issue, and what recommendations the board has made to correct identified deficiencies.\n\n(Sec. 344) Requires the Director of the National Park Service (NPS), acting on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, to transfer to the District government, without consideration, and for public recreational use only, jurisdiction of a portion of specified NPs land in Anacostia Park which includes the Kenilworth Parkside Community Center (currently occupied under permit by the District) and all of U.S. Reservation 523.\n\nProvides that nothing in the Act precludes the District from entering into a sublease for all or part of the property with a public not-for-profit entity for the management or maintenance of the property.\n\n(Sec. 345) Authorizes the project for the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier, Illinois, initiated in Public Law 99-662, at a total cost of $9.1 million, with a Federal cost of $6.825 million and a non-Federal cost of $2.275 million.\n\n(Sec. 346) Requires the Comptroller General to conduct biennial management evaluations of the District of Columbia Chartering Authorities for the District of Columbia Public Charter Schools. Specifies the contents of such evaluations.\n\nRequires the Government Accountability Office, by May 1, 2005, to submit to congressional appropriations committees a baseline report on the performance of each authorizer in meeting the requirements of the School Reform Act of 1995.\n\nApplies to the District of Columbia Board of Education Charter Schools Office's financial statements the same auditing requirements that apply to a District of Columbia Public Charter School Board's financial statements.\n\n(Sec. 347) Requires the Public Charter School Board to: (1) maintain its accounts according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for Not-for-Profit Organizations; and (2) forward the findings and recommendations of any audit to the Mayor, the D.C. Council, the appropriate congressional committees, and the CFO.\n\nGrants such Board the authority to solicit, award, and execute contracts independently of the Office of Contracting and Procurement and the Chief Procurement Officer. Provides that nothing in the District of Columbia Code regarding procurement shall affect the Board's authority under this Act.\n\n(The Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2005, Division J of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, superseded Sec. 347 in the following manner: Repeals the qualification \"for Not-for-Profit Organizations,\" to require the Public Charter School Board to maintain its accounts according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Repeals the proviso that nothing in the D.C. Code regarding procurement shall affect the Board's authority under this Act.)"
