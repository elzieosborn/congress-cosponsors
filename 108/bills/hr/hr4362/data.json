    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept, in trust for the Nisqually Tribe, all right, title, and interest of the United States in two specified parcels of real property, including any improvements thereon, consisting of approximately 168 acres at Fort Lewis, Washington, in lieu of the conveyance of the parcels directly to the tribe under the Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002. Directs the tribe to continue to comply with provisions of that Act specifying consideration for the transfer in the form of a land exchange. Requires such consideration to be free from all liens, encumbrances, or other interests except those, if any, acceptable to the recipient.\n\nRequires the acceptance of real property in trust for the Nisqually Tribe pursuant to this Act to recognize and preserve to the Bonneville Power Administration, in perpetuity and without the right of revocation, rights in existence at the time of conveyance under a specified permit between the Department of the Army and the Administration with regard to any portion of such property upon which the Administration retains transmission facilities. Provides that the rights recognized and preserved include the right to upgrade those facilities.\n\nTerminates such recognized and preserved permit rights only upon the Administration's relocation of such transmission facilities, and then only with regard to that portion of those facilities that are relocated.\n\nDirects the Secretary, as trustee for the tribe, to grant to the Administration, without consideration and subject to the same rights recognized and preserved, such additional easements across the property accepted in trust for the tribe under this Act as the Administration deems necessary to accommodate relocation or reconnection of transmission facilities from property owned by the tribe and held in trust by the Secretary."
