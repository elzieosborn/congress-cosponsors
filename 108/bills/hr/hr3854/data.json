Provides that such amendment shall not apply if, during the year in which the warning is made, legislation is enacted which eliminates excess general revenue Medicare funding for the period beginning with the fiscal year for which the determination is made and ending on September 30, 2013, as certified by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund not later than 30 days after the enactment of such legislation.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that legislation submitted pursuant to such amendment in a year should be designed to eliminate excess general revenue Medicare funding for the period that begins with the fiscal year for which the determination is made and ends on September 30, 2013.\n\nSets out the special procedures for House and Senate consideration of the President's legislative proposal in response to such warning."
