    "text": "Medicare Reform Act of 2003 - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new title XXII (Establishment of Medicare Premium Support System) to restructure the Medicare program under SSA title XVIII into a health care program similar to that for Federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (which includes prescription drug benefits). Provides for standard and high option Medicare plans, while allowing certain Medicare beneficiaries to elect to retain their current Medicare benefits. Bases premiums on the beneficiary's level of income. Pays the entire premium in cases involving qualified low-income Medicare beneficiaries with income that does not exceed 200 percent of the official poverty line, with partial premium payments for other low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Establishes in the Treasury the Medicare Trust Fund, consisting in part of an appropriation of hospital insurance taxes from under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance), for paying the expenses incurred by this Act."
