Makes this amendment effective as though it had been enacted on September 30, 2002.\n\nGrants authority to qualifying States, with respect to FY 1998 through 2001 SCHIP allotments, for fiscal years in which such allotments are available, to elect to use not more than 20 percent of them (instead of for expenditures under SCHIP) for Medicaid medical assistance payments with respect to certain children under SSA title XIX.\n\nAmends the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 to make a technical amendment with respect to State eligibility for an increase in its Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) or an increase in the cap on Medicaid payments to territories. Makes such amendment effective as if included in the enactment of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003."
