  <summary date="2003-10-24T21:27:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise the special rule for the redistribution and availability of unexpended FY1998 and 1999 SCHIP allotments, including to: (1) extend the availability of FY 1998 and 1999 reallocated funds through FY 2004; and (2) permit 50 percent of the total amount of unexpended FY 2000 and 2001 SCHIP allotments that remain available to a State through the end of FY 2002 and 2003 to remain available for expenditure by the State through the end of FY 2004 and 2005, respectively. Makes this amendment effective as though it had been enacted on September 30, 2002.

Grants authority to qualifying States, with respect to FY 1998 through 2001 SCHIP allotments, for fiscal years in which such allotments are available, to elect to use not more than 20 percent of them (instead of for expenditures under SCHIP) for Medicaid medical assistance payments with respect to certain children under SSA title XIX.

Amends the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 to make a technical amendment with respect to State eligibility for an increase in its Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) or an increase in the cap on Medicaid payments to territories. Makes such amendment effective as if included in the enactment of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.</summary>
