    "text": "Presidential Appointments Improvement Act of 2003 - Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to set forth separate, revised financial disclosure reporting requirements for executive branch personnel that eliminate, raise the thresholds for, or reduce the categories of value under specified current requirements.Requires a person to file a financial disclosure report within 30 days of taking the oath of office of President or Vice President, unless the person is the incumbent in such position.Requires disclosure of the source, description, and category of income from any source aggregating more than $500 in a year. Revises, for disclosure purposes, the categories of value for reporting income investment, assets, and liabilities and the thresholds for reporting interests in property or in a trade or business. Raises from: (1) $10,000 to $20,000 the threshold for the reporting of liabilities; and (2) $5,000 to $25,000 the threshold for the reporting by non-elected individuals of compensation received for personal services. Requires reports to include the sources of income earned by the spouse which exceeds $500 (currently $1,000).Requires the Executive Clerk of the White House, within 15 days after a major party nominates its candidate for President, to transmit to that candidate an electronic record on presidentially appointed positions.Requires each Federal agency to submit to the President and specified congressional committees a plan providing for the reduction of the number of positions and the levels of positions within that agency that require an appointment by the President.Requires the Director of the Office of Government Ethics to review the conflict of interest laws relating to Federal employment and to report recommendations for legislation to improve coordination, uniformity, and efficiency in their administration."
