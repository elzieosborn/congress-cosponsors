    "text": "Classroom Safety Act of 2003 - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to authorize school personnel to discipline (including expel or suspend), in the same manner in which such personnel may discipline a child without a disability, any child with a disability who commits specified school-related weapon or drug offenses. (Thus provides an exception to current IDEA procedural safeguards that require placement in an alternative educational setting.)Authorizes such personnel to modify the disciplinary action on a case-by-case basis. Permits assertion of a defense that the offense was committed unintentionally or innocently.Allows the local educational agency (LEA) responsible for providing educational services to a child with a disability who is expelled or suspended under this Act to choose to continue to provide educational services to such child; but specifies that an LEA that so chooses to continue to provide services: (1) is not required by IDEA to provide such child with a free appropriate public education, or any particular level of service; and (2) has discretion as to the location where it provides the services."
