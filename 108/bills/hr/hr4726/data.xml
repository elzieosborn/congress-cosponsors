  <summary date="2004-09-14T15:24:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Describes the following as acts that unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce, and prohibits States, political subdivisions, and any other taxing authority from: (1) assessing natural gas pipeline property at a value that has a higher ratio to its true market value than the ratio used to assess other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction; (2) levying or collecting a tax on such an assessment; (3) levying or collecting an ad valorem property tax on natural gas pipeline property at a rate that exceeds the rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction; or (4) imposing any other tax that discriminates against a natural gas pipeline providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

 Grants jurisdiction to U.S. District Courts over cases involving violations of such prohibitions.</summary>
