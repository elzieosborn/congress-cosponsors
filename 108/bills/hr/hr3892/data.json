Includes in taxpayer gross income any amount distributed from the Reserve and any penalties for self dealing or failure to distribute funds for Reserve purposes. Imposes a penalty of ten percent additional tax for any amount distributed from a Reserve that is not used exclusively to pay qualified hazardous waste costs."
