Cowlitz Indian Tribe Distribution of Judgment Funds Act - Creates a plan under which the Secretary of the Interior shall distribute the judgment funds and certain accrued interest awarded to the Cowlitz Indian Tribe of Washington by the Indian Claims Commission Docket No. 218 (ICCD).

 Prohibits the distribution of principal (funds awarded by ICCD and all accrued interest as of one year before enactment of this Act) under this Act, except as provided by this Act.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) maintain undistributed current judgment funds (funds awarded by ICCD and all accrued interest as of the enactment of this Act) in an interest bearing account in trust for the tribe; and (2) disburse principal or interest in accordance with this Act within 30 days after receipt by the Northwest Regional Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, or a request by the tribe's governing body for such disbursement.

Requires the Secretary to set aside 20 percent of the current judgment fund for a tribal elderly assistance program to provide one elderly assistance payment to each enrolled tribal elder within 30 days after: (1) the tribe's governing body has compiled and reviewed for accuracy a list of all enrolled tribal members that are both a minimum of one-sixteenth Cowlitz blood and 62 years of age or older as of February 14, 2000; (2) the Secretary has verified the blood quantum and age of the tribal member; and (3) the tribe's governing body has made a request for such disbursement.

Provides that if a tribal elder eligible for the payment dies before receiving it, the payment shall be added to and distributed in accordance with the emergency assistance program under this Act.

 Requires the Secretary to set aside specified percentages of the principal and after a two year period in some circumstances, disburse the interest earned on it for tribal: (1) emergency assistance; (2) education, vocation, and cultural training; (3) housing assistance; (4) economic development and construction and maintenance of tribal and cultural centers; (5) natural resources; (6) cultural resources; (7) health; and (8) administration.

Prescribes general conditions for the management and use of all available funds by the tribe's governing body.</summary>
