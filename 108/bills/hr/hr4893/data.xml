Amends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 to increase funding levels for projects to preserve the structural safety of Bureau of Reclamation dams and related facilities.

Directs the Secretary of the Interior: (1) during the construction of a Bureau facility modification, to consider cost containment measures recommended by a project beneficiary (beneficiary) that has elected to consult with the Bureau; and (2) to provide to project beneficiaries periodic notice regarding the costs and status of the modification.

Directs the Secretary: (1) upon identifying a Bureau facility for modification, to provide to the beneficiaries written notice describing the need and the identifying and implementing process for the modification and summarizing the administrative and legal requirements; (2) to provide beneficiaries an opportunity to consult with the Bureau on the planning, design, and construction of the proposed modification and to develop and provide time frames for the consultation; (3) prior to submitting required reports, to consider any alternative submitted in writing by a beneficiary that has elected to consult with the Bureau; and (4) to provide to the beneficiary a timely written response describing any proposed actions to address the recommendation. Requires the Secretary's response to be included in the required reports. Authorizes the Secretary to waive a requirement upon determining that its implementation could have an adverse impact on dam safety or security.</summary>
