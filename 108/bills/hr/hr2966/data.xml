  <summary date="2004-12-29T21:35:06Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 20, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Right-to-Ride Livestock on Federal Lands Act of 2004 - Amends Public Law 91-383 to direct the Secretary of the Interior to preserve and facilitate the continued use and access of pack and saddle stock animals on parts of National Park System lands where there is a historical tradition of such use. Directs that as a general rule, all trails, routes, and areas used by such animals shall remain open and accessible for such use. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to implement a proposed reduction in the use and access of pack and saddle stock animals on such lands only after complying with the full review process required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Makes the same amendments to other laws regarding other public lands as follows: (1) the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, with respect to Bureau of Land Management lands; (2) the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, with respect to National Wildlife Refuge System lands; and (3) the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, with respect to National Forest System lands (with the Secretary directed to act in this case being the Secretary of Agriculture).

Prohibits: (1) the Secretary from refusing to issue a permit for a new use of pack and saddle stock animals, including use by a commercial outfitter or guide, without complying with applicable resource management plans and planning processes required under each such law regarding public lands described above or any other provision of law; (2) limiting the Secretary's authority to impose a temporary emergency closure of a trail, route, or area to pack and saddle stock animals or issue special permits; or (3) creating a preference for one recreational use for any unit of the National Park System, without consideration of the unit's stated purpose.

Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to issue final rules to define the meaning of a historical tradition of use of pack and saddle stock animals on Federal lands for purposes of this Act.</summary>
