Establishes as an affirmative defense the accused's reasonable belief that the person was at least 16.\n\nDefines sexual abuse of a prisoner as knowingly engaging in a sexual act with a person who is: (1) in official detention or confinement; (2) under the custodial, supervisory, or disciplinary authority of the accused; and (3) is not the accused's spouse.\n\nMakes the above crimes punishable by court-martial and sets forth interim maximum punishments for each."
