  <summary date="2003-10-22T19:30:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Pilot Project, Good Samaritan Provision for Abandoned and Inactive Mined Land Remediation Act - Declares that the purpose of this Act is to initiate a ten-year pilot program to facilitate the cleanup of abandoned and inactive mine sites in the Animas River Basin that negatively impact water quality by limiting certain liability under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for third parties not responsible for the degradation but who take steps to improve water quality.

Limits the scope of this Act to abandoned or inactive hardrock mines located in the Animas River watershed above Elk Creek in San Juan County, Colorado.

Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, with the concurrence of the State of Colorado, to issue, modify, enforce, or terminate a remediation permit that modifies requirements for discharges associated with remediation activity at an abandoned or inactive mined land.

Sets forth procedural guidelines for a remediation permit application for activities at an abandoned or inactive mined land from which there is, or may be, a discharge of pollutants into waters.</summary>
