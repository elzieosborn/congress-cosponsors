Authorizes the Authority to increase the Federal share to up to 90 percent of a project's total cost (to aid communities that could not otherwise meet matching funds requirements). Requires the Authority to make grants to local development districts for administrative expenses.Directs the Authority, for purposes of grant assistance, to designate within the region distressed counties, economically strong counties, attainment counties, competitive counties, and isolated areas of distress.Requires each affected State to submit to the Authority an annual development plan for the appropriate State area within the region."
