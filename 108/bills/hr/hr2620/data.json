(2) the number of persons granted continued presence in the United States; (3) the number of persons who have applied for, been granted, or been denied a \"T\" visa or otherwise provided status under the Immigration and Nationality Act; (4) the number of persons charged or convicted of trafficking related criminal offenses; (5) the amount, recipient, and purpose of each grant issued under this Act (and related provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961); (6) the nature of training conducted for appropriate Department of State and the Department of Justice personnel in identifying and protecting victims of severe forms of trafficking; and (7) activities undertaken by the Senior Policy Operating Group to carry out its responsibilities.\n\nDeclares that the Director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking (OMCT) of the Department of State, shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, with the rank of Ambassador-at-Large.\n\nEstablishes within the executive branch a Senior Policy Operating Group to coordinate activities of Federal departments and agencies regarding policies (including grants and grant policies) involving the international trafficking in persons and the implementation of this division.\n\nRequires that evidence of convictions and sentences for acts of trafficking and official complicity in acts of trafficking (as well as evidence of investigations and prosecutions) be considered in the evaluation of a foreign country's efforts to eliminate trafficking.\n\nDeclares that, after reasonable requests from the Department of State for data regarding investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and sentences, a government which does not provide such data consistent with its resources shall be presumed not to have vigorously investigated, prosecuted, convicted or sentenced acts of trafficking.\n\nAmends the TVPA to require the Secretary of State to report annually to specified comgressional committees a watch list of countries that require special scrutiny during the following year.\n\nAmends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize assistance for foreign police training.\n\nAmends the VTVPA to direct the President, acting through the Council of Economic Advisors, the National Research Council of the National Academies, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and the Director of Central Intelligence, to carry out research, including by grants to NGOs, that addresses among other things: (1) the economic causes and consequences of domestic and international trafficking in persons; (2) the effectiveness of programs and initiatives funded or administered by Federal agencies to prevent trafficking in persons and to protect and assist victims of trafficking; and (3) the interrelationship between trafficking in persons and global health risks.\n\nAuthorizes the President, at any time after refusing under the TVPA certain nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance to a country, including participation in educational and cultural exchange programs, to waive such sanctions.\n\n(Sec. 7) Amends the TVPA to authorize appropriations for FY 2004 and 2005 to: (1) the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking, especially the operations and staffing requirements of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking and the Senior Policy Operating Group;
