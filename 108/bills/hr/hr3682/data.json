Prohibits the Secretary from granting a waiver from Buy America provisions for microcomputer equipment.\n\nAllows any party adversely affected by an agency action related to Buy America provisions to seek administrative review under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nProvides that the amendments made by this Act shall not modify the scope or terms of an existing waiver granted to microprocessors or microcomputers, including software, incorporated in certain train control or communication equipment."
