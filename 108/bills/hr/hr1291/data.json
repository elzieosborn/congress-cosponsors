    "text": "State High Risk Pool Drug Assistance Program Act of 2003 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to add to the definition of a covered entity for purposes of the limitation on prices of drugs purchased by such entities. Includes as a covered entity a State-operated qualified high risk pool that provides for premium rates and covered benefits for such coverage consistent with standards included in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Model Health Plan for Uninsurable Individuals. Directs the Secretary to include certain conditions in regulations implementing this Act, including that: (1) pharmacies that fill prescriptions for eligible individuals may bill the administrator or pharmacy benefit manager of the pool; (2) the pool shall maintain records of an eligible individual's health care claims; and (3) individuals shall receive health care services from contracted network providers. States that the pool shall serve individuals who would be eligible as a covered entity but for level of income, though that it shall not be limited to such individuals."
