    "text": "Amends specified Federal laws to authorize appropriations for: (1) the U.S. contribution to the thirteenth replenishment of the International Development Association; (2) the U.S. contribution to the seventh replenishment of the Asian Development Fund; and (3) the U.S. contribution to the ninth replenishment of the African Development Fund.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at each multilateral development institution to inform such institution of specified U.S. policy goals (and to work toward achieving such goals at the institution before June 30, 2005). Requires each institution to: (1) post on its website an electronic version of Board of Directors meeting minutes within 60 days after any such meeting, with material deemed too sensitive for public distribution redacted; (2) keep a written transcript or electronic recording of each Board meeting and preserve it for at least ten years; (3) make available to the public 15 days before Board consideration (or if not then available, when the documents are distributed to the Board) all public sector loan documents, country assistance strategies, sector strategies, and sector policies prepared by the institution and presented for Board endorsement or approval; (4) post on its website an annual report of statistical summaries and case studies of fraud and corruption cases pursued by its investigations unit; and (5) require any health, education, or poverty-focused loan, credit, grant, document, policy, or strategy prepared by it to include specific outcome and output indicators to measure results, and that such indicators and results be published periodically during execution, and at the completion, of the project or program. Urges the Secretary no later than 60 days after a meeting of the Board of a multilateral development institution to provide for publication on the Department of the Treasury's website of the institution's written statements regarding inspection mechanism claims and cases."
