(Requires petition filing within two years of such death.)\n\nStates that an application for status adjustment by the alien wife, child, or parent of an alien member of the armed forces who was granted service-related posthumous citizenship based upon service in such zone may be adjudicated as if the death had not occurred. (Requires application filing prior to such death.)\n\nTreats the spouse, child, or parent of a lawful permanent resident who was granted service-related posthumous citizenship based upon service in such zone as a valid petitioner for immediate relative status. (Requires self-petitions within two years of such death.)\n\nPermits such aliens to apply for permanent resident status adjustment.\n\nWaives specified grounds of inadmissibility.\n\nGives priority to naturalization applications as set forth in this Act."
