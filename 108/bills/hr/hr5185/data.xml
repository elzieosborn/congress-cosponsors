Higher Education Extension Act of 2004 - Provides for a temporary extension of programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA).

Extends through FY 2005 the authorization of appropriations for, and the duration of, each program authorized under HEA. Requires the extended FY 2005 funding for any HEA program to be at a level that is the greater of: (1) the amount authorized to be appropriated for FY 2004; or (2) the amount appropriated for FY 2004.

Provides for continued performance through FY 2005 of any FY 2004 HEA functions by the Secretary of Education, a State, an institution of higher education, a guaranty agency, a lender, or another person or entity. Continues advisory committees, interagency organizations, or other entities and their required or authorized HEA functions.

 Prohibits applying certain contingent and automatic extensions under the General Education Provisions Act to further extend the authorization of appropriations for any program on the basis of its extension under this Act.</summary>
