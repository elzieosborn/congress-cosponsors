  <summary date="2004-09-02T16:19:17Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 20, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (with respect to land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management) or the Secretary of Agriculture (with respect to land under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service), within 120 days after the request of an Indian tribe to enter into an agreement or contract to carry out a project to protect Indian forest land or rangeland (including a project to restore Federal land that borders on or is adjacent to such land) that meets specified criteria, to issue public notice of initiation of any necessary environmental review or of the potential of entering into such an agreement or contract under which the Indian tribe would carry out activities to achieve land management goals for Federal land under the Secretary's jurisdiction and bordering or adjacent to the Indian forest land or rangeland under the Indian tribe's jurisdiction.

States as criteria for the selection of Indian land that, among other things, the bordering or adjacent Federal land: (1) pose a fire, disease, or other threat to Indian land or a tribal community, or be in need of land restoration activities; and (2) present or involve a feature or circumstance unique to the particular tribe (including treaty rights or biological, archaeological, historical, or cultural circumstances).

Authorizes the appropriate Secretary to enter into such an agreement or contract following completion of any necessary environmental analysis. Specifies proposal evaluation and determination factors.

Requires, within four years after enactment of this Act, the Secretary to report to Congress on the Indian tribal requests received and agreements or contracts that have been entered into.</summary>
