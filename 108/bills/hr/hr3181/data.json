The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nPredisaster Mitigation Program Reauthorization Act of 2003 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to reauthorize through FY 2006 the program of technical and financial assistance to States and local governments for cost-effective predisaster hazard mitigation measures.\n\nIncreases from 7.5 to 15 percent of the estimated aggregate amount of disaster assistance grants for a particular major disaster the total contributions the President may make to the cost of hazard mitigation measures with respect to such disaster (applicable to any major disaster declared after September 30, 2002).\n\nAuthorizes the President to provide additional repair assistance to an individual or household that is unable, using insurance proceeds, loans, or other financial assistance, including Small Business Administration assistance, to complete repairs of an owner-occupied private residence, utilities, or residential infrastructure (such as a private access route) damaged by a major disaster declared after enactment of this Act.\n\nAmends the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 to extend until September 30, 2005, the deadline for completion by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office of a study estimating the reduction in Federal disaster assistance that has resulted and is likely to result from enactment of such Act."
