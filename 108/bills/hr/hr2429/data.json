    "text": "Surveillance Oversight Act and Disclosure Act of 2003 - Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to authorize courts established to hear applications, grant orders, and review denials regarding electronic surveillance to establish rules and procedures and take actions necessary to administer their responsibilities under FISA. Directs that such rules and procedures be transmitted to the judges on such courts, the Chief Justice of the United States, and specified congressional committees. Requires the Attorney General to issue a public report annually on the aggregate number of U.S. persons targeted for FISA orders, the aggregate number of applications for orders for U.S. persons and for all persons without regard to nationality, and the number of times that the Attorney General has authorized that such information be used in a criminal proceeding. Amends: (1) the Federal criminal code to require that the semiannual report of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to the intelligence and judiciary committees concerning requests for access to telephone and transactional records include a separate statement of requests made of institutions operating as public libraries or serving as libraries of secondary schools or institutions of higher education; (2) the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 to require that the Attorney General's semiannual report regarding requests for financial records go to the judiciary committees; and (3) the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require that the Attorney General's semiannual report regarding disclosures by credit reporting agencies to the FBI be made to the judiciary committees."
