Boren National Security Education Act of 1991 to require students receiving training under the Initiative to enter into service agreements with the intelligence community element providing such training or reimburse the United States.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Defense to take steps to increase the number of qualified educational institutions receiving Initiative grants.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Defense to award scholarships to U.S. citizens who are native speakers of languages designated as critical and not proficient at a professional level in English to enable them to pursue English studies. Requires recipients to enter into service agreements. Requires the DCI to transfer ICM funds to carry out such program."
