  <summary date="2003-11-18T21:30:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Requires the head of a U.S. executive agency that enters into a contract for the repair, maintenance, or construction of infrastructure in Iraq without full and open competition to publish in the Federal Register or Commerce Business Daily and otherwise make available to the public within 30 days after the contract is entered into: (1) the amount of the contract; (2) a brief description of its scope; (3) a discussion of how the agency identified, and solicited offers from, potential contractors to perform the contract, together with a list of the potential contractors that were issued solicitations for the offers; and (4) the justification and approval documents on which was based the determination to use procedures other than procedures that provide for full and open competition.

Authorizes an agency head to: (1) withhold from such publication and disclosure any document classified for restricted access in accordance with an Executive order in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; and (2) redact any part so classified in a document not so classified before publication and disclosure of the document. Requires the agency head to make available an unredacted version of such a document to the chairman and ranking member of specified congressional committees.</summary>
