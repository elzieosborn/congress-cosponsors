    "text": "Amends Federal transportation law to direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration (TSA)) to issue guidance for the use of biometrics or other technology that positively verifies the identity of each airport employee and law enforcement officer who enters a secure area of an airport. (Currently, the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is authorized to provide for such use).\n\nAuthorizes appropriations.\n\nDirects the Assistant Secretary to establish a program to enter into multi-year contracts with airport operators or other non-Federal entities to provide electronic explosive detection system images of checked baggage for screening purposes.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare a transportation sector specific plan and transportation modal security plans that at a minimum: (1) set risk-based priorities for defending aviation assets; (2) assign roles and missions to Federal, State, regional, and local authorities and to stakeholders; (3) establish a damage mitigation and recovery plan for the aviation system in the event of a terrorist attack; and (4) include a threat matrix document that outlines each threat to the U.S. aviation system and corresponding layers of security in place to address such threat.\n\nDirects the Assistant Secretary to commence testing of a next generation passenger prescreening system that will allow the DHS to assume the performance of comparing passenger name records (including airport employees) to the automatic selectee and no fly lists, utilizing the Federal Government's terrorist watchlist.\n\nSets forth requirements for: (1) the deployment and use of explosive and nonmetallic weapon detection equipment at airport screening checkpoints; (2) a pilot program to evaluate the use of blast-resistant containers for cargo and baggage on passenger aircraft; (3) the establishment in the DHS of a Checkpoint Screening Security Fund; (4) a pilot program to test and deploy next generation security checkpoint screening technology at a certain number of U.S. airports; (5) civil penalties for failure to secure a cockpit door; (6) appropriate in-flight counterterrorism procedures and tactic training to Federal law enforcement officers; (7) a pilot program to allow pilots participating in the Federal flight deck officer program to transport their firearms on their persons; (8) implementation of the registered traveler program; (9) the establishment of an Under Secretary for Local Government and Tourism; (10) the Federal Air Marshal Service to provide air marshal training to foreign law enforcement personnel; and (11) international efforts to limit the availability, transfer, and proliferation of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS)."
