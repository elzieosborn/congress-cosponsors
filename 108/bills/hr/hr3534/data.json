Enhances civil and criminal penalties for document fraud and false statements of citizenship.\n\nAmends Federal law concerning passports to require fingerprinting and background checks of applicants for U.S. passports.\n\nEstablishes a visa term compliance bond.\n\nRequires the development and use of more secure Social Security cards and birth certificates.\n\nAmends the INA to permit employers who seek work eligibility verification for new hires within three days after the date of hire to claim an affirmative defense to employer sanctions. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to create an electronic employment verification system. Exempts from liability those who rely on the verification system in good faith.\n\nEstablishes a new guest worker program that replaces the current H nonimmigrant visa category with a single H visa covering all aliens coming to the United States temporarily to perform skilled or unskilled work, where U.S. workers are not available. Requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency make specified certifications to Congress as a prerequisite to implementation of the program."
