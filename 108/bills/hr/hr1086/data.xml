  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Passed House amended">Standards Development Organization Advancement Act of 2003 - Amends the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 to provide that the conduct of a standards development organization (SDO) while engaged in a standards development activity shall be subject to a rule of reason standard in any action under the antitrust laws.Defines "standards development activity" as an action for the purpose of developing, promulgating, revising, interpreting, or maintaining a voluntary consensus standard, or using such standard in conformity assessment activities, including actions related to the intellectual property policies of the SDO. Excludes as such an activity: (1) exchanging information among competitors relating to cost, sales, profitability, prices, marketing, or distribution of any product, process, or service that is not reasonably required for the purpose of developing or promulgating a voluntary consensus standard; (2) entering into any agreement or engaging in any other conduct that would allocate a market with a competitor; and (3) entering into any agreement or conspiracy that would set or restrain prices of any good or service.Limits the amount of damages and attorney's fees recoverable with respect to standards development activity engaged in by an SDO if advance notice of such joint venture activity has been filed.Authorizes an SDO, by the later of 90 days after the commencement of voluntary consensus standards activity or the enactment of this Act, to file simultaneously with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission a written notification disclosing: (1) the name and principal place of business of the SDO; and (2) documents showing the nature and scope of such activity. Allows an SDO to file additional disclosure notifications as appropriate to extend protections under this Act to activities that are not covered by, or that have changed significantly since, the initial filing.</summary>
