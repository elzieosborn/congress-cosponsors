    "text": "Long-Term Care Hospital Moratorium Act of 2004 - Prohibits payment under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act for inpatient hospital services provided in a long-term care hospital unless they were provided for services furnished for a patient in a bed which was either in operation or in development as of the date of the introduction of this Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to terminate such moratorium if the Secretary determines that: (1) there is a clinical need for a growth in the number of beds in long-term care hospitals; (2) an appropriate reimbursement system and rate are in place for Medicare payment for inpatient hospital services in such hospitals; and (3) a clinical admission policy for such hospitals exists that minimizes the acceptance of patients into these settings that can be appropriately treated in alternative, less costly post acute settings. Requires the Secretary also to determine that appropriate interventions are implemented to ensure that beneficiaries within long-term care hospitals are receiving the treatment they require and that Medicare funds allocated to these hospitals are being prudently spent."
