Permits only the President, or a person designated by the President, to appoint such a commission. Requires a commission to consist of not less than three members and not more than seven members.\n\nStates that trial and defense counsel shall be detailed for a military commission on the same basis as such counsel are detailed for a general court-martial.\n\nRequires members of a military commission to deliberate and vote in closed conference.\n\nProhibits: (1) a military commission from finding a person guilty of an offense, and determining a sentence, except by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken; and (2) from sentencing a person to suffer death except by the concurrence of all the members as to the findings and as to the sentence.\n\nSets forth other requirements relating to a commission, including requiring the accused in a military commission to be given specified minimum rights and protections.\n\nOutlines procedures for, and courts of, appeal."
