  <summary date="2004-09-22T21:38:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Parental Responsibility Obligations Met through Immigration System Enforcement Act - PROMISE Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) make an alien excludable from U.S. admission for nonpayment of child support (permits admission upon satisfaction of payments or in compliance with a payment schedule); (2) authorize an immigration officer to serve an alien with legal process in child support cases; and (3) include nonpayment of child support among the considerations for failure of an alien to establish good moral character.

Amends the Social Security Act to authorize the disclosure of an alien's child support-related information to the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary of State.</summary>
