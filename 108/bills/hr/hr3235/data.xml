  <summary date="2003-12-19T15:20:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Responsible and Secure ID Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 25 percent of the apportionment of specified Federal highway funds to any State that does not have in effect laws that require: (1) as a condition of issuing or renewing a driver's license, proof that the individual is a citizen or national of, or an alien lawfully present in, the United States; and (2) that a driver's license issued to an alien must expire not later than the last day of the period during which the alien is authorized to be present in the United States, unless the alien is lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence or the alien's lawful presence is not subject to termination on a date certain.

Directs the Secretary to waive application of this Act to a State if the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the State's noncompliance does not pose a security risk to the United States.

Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the period of availability of withheld funds; (2) the apportionment of withheld funds after compliance; and (3) the availability of lapsed funds to the Secretary of Homeland Security for programs and activities to secure the borders of the United States and to enhance immigration enforcement activities.</summary>
