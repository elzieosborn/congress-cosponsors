Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey to S.C.D.P. Management, Inc. (doing business as Father Joe's Villages), without consideration and subject to valid existing rights, specified Federal lands in Riverside County, California, to provide a homeless shelter, a training center, and affordable housing.

Provides that if the Villages or any subsequent owner of the land transferred under this Act uses that land for purposes other than those specified above, all right, title, and interest to such land (and any improvements thereon) shall revert to the United States to be administered by the Bureau of Land Management, if the Secretary determines that such a reversion is in the best interests of the United States.</summary>
