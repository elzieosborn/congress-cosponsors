The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nTitle I: Castillo De San Marcos National Monument Preservation Act - Castillo de San Marcos National Monument Preservation and Education Act - (Sec. 102) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to design and construct a Visitor Center for the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, subject to such project being prioritized in the National Park Service's five-year, line-item construction program. Requires the Visitor Center to be located and constructed in accordance with the Preferred Alternative identified in the Record of Decision for the General Management Plan for the Monument, expected to be signed in 2005.\n\n(Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the city of St. Augustine, Florida, the Colonial St. Augustine Preservation Foundation, other Federal, State, and local departments or agencies, academic institutions, and non-profit entities for the planning and design, construction, management, and operation of the Visitor Center.\n\n(Sec. 104) Provides that, if the Preferred Alternative for the Visitor Center is located outside the boundary of the Monument, the Secretary is authorized to acquire the site for the Visitor Center from willing sellers, by donation, purchase, or exchange. Requires, after completion of the acquisition, the boundary to be modified to reflect the acquisition of such land.\n\n(Sec. 105) Mandates that, prior to initiating any planning, design, or construction on the Visitor Center, such project must be reviewed and approved by the National Park Service consistent with partnership construction guidelines established by that agency.\n\nTitle II: Castillo De San Marcos National Monument Boundary Modification - Castillo de San Marcos National Monument Boundary Adjustment Act of 2004 - Directs the Secretary to: (1) convey, without consideration, to the City all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the lands known as Orange Street, a portion of the Monument; and (2) upon completion of the conveyance, revise the Monument's boundary to exclude the land conveyed.\n\nRevises such boundary to include specified land."
