  <summary date="2004-09-23T20:12:25Z" status="Reported to House with amendment(s)">Utah Test and Training Range Protection Act - States that nothing in this Act or the Wilderness Act shall: (1) preclude low-level overflights and operations of military aircraft, missiles, or unmanned aerial vehicles over the Utah Test and Training Range (Range), including the Dugway Proving Ground; (2) preclude the designation of new or expansion of existing units of special use airspace or the use or establishment of military training routes over such Range; (3) prevent any required maintenance of existing communications, instrumentation, or electronic tracking systems in the Range or the addition of communications, instrumentation, or equipment necessary for effective testing and training to meet military requirements in wilderness study areas located beneath special use airspace of the Range, upon specified determinations by the Secretary of the Interior; (4) preclude the continuation of a current memorandum of understanding between the Departments of the Interior and Air Force with respect to emergency access and response within the Range; or (5) permit ground military operations in covered wilderness of the Range, unless such operations are otherwise permissible under Federal law and consistent with the Wilderness Act.

Directs the Secretary to develop, maintain, and revise land use plans for Federal lands located in the Range, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense. Limits the issuance of rights-of-way in the Range.

Designates certain Federal lands in Tooele County, Utah, as the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area. Withdraws such lands from all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws, including mining and mineral and geothermal leasing. Authorizes fish and wildlife management and livestock grazing within such areas, as appropriate. Releases the Browns Springs Cherrystem area from its status as a wilderness study area.

Directs the Secretary to identify approximately 640 additional acres of Bureau of Land Management lands in Utah to be administered in trust for the benefit of the Skull Valley Band of Goshutes.</summary>
