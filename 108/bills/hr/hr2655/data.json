    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAmends the Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Program Act of 1998 (IPPCTPA) to limit the number of participants in the Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Program who have a degree from an institution of higher education to no more than 20 percent.\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise the nonimmigrant alien eligibility qualifications for program participants. Sets a minimum age of 21 (retaining the current age 35 maximum), and requires that the individual has: (1) been unemployed for at least six months; and (2) has resided for at least six months in Northern Ireland or one of designated border counties of the Republic of Ireland. Reduces from 36 to 24 months the temporary period of the visit to the United States for participation in the program.\n\nDenies any such person eligibility to apply for an immigrant visa, or for permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under such Act until he or she has resided and been physically present in the country of nationality or last residence for an aggregate of a least one year following departure from the United States. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive this requirement if: (1) departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien's spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a U.S. citizen or a lawfully resident alien); (2) the alien cannot return to the country of his or her nationality or last residence because he or she would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion; or (3) the admission of the alien is in the U.S. public or national interest.\n\nExtends the authority of the IPPCTPA through FY 2008. Requires the Secretary to report each program year to Congress (currently, the third program year and the three subsequent years) on the number of aliens admitted who have overstayed their visas."
