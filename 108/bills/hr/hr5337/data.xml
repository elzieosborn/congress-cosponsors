  <summary date="2004-12-03T21:20:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to redefine agent of a foreign principal to include Members of Congress who enter into written agreements with any foreign person to modify any Federal law or regulation that would result in easing any restriction imposed on any country the government of which has been determined by the Secretary of State, for purposes of specified Federal law, to be a government that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.

Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to deem any agreement or action on behalf of a foreign person or a business concern which is prohibited under the Federal criminal code to be U.S. export assistance prohibited under such Act. (Currently, U.S. assistance and financing is prohibited for exports to Cuba or for commercial exports to Iran, Libya, North Korea, or Sudan.)

Expresses the sense of Congress that any Member of Congress who violates the Federal criminal code should be sanctioned under the appropriate congressional rule.</summary>
