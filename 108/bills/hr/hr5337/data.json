(Currently, U.S. assistance and financing is prohibited for exports to Cuba or for commercial exports to Iran, Libya, North Korea, or Sudan.)\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that any Member of Congress who violates the Federal criminal code should be sanctioned under the appropriate congressional rule."
