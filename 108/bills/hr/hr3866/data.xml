  <summary date="2004-06-25T22:10:41Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on April 27, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 - Amends: (1) the Controlled Substances Act to subject an offense of manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute an anabolic steroid within 1,000 feet of a sports facility to twice the maximum penalty otherwise imposed for a controlled substance violation; and (2) the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 to modify the definition of "anabolic steroid" to include certain steroid precursors (including tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) and androstenedione) and to exclude dehydroepiandrosterone.

Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to offenses involving anabolic steroids and consider amending such guidelines to provide for increased penalties.

Authorizes the Attorney General, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to exempt from regulation under the Controlled Substances Act any compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any anabolic steroid that is intended for administration to a human being or an animal and that does not present any significant potential for abuse because of its concentration, preparation, formulation, or delivery system.

Directs the Secretary to prepare and submit a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce evaluating the health risks associated with dietary supplements not scheduled under this Act which contain substances similar to those added to the list of controlled substances under this Act, including recommendations on whether such substances should be regulated as anabolic steroids.</summary>
