  <summary date="2005-01-03T16:23:48Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 22, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2004 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue a temporary renewal certificate for not more than 45 days to a mammography facility seeking reaccreditation if the accreditation body has issued an accreditation extension because the facility: (1) has submitted the required materials but the accreditation body is unable to complete the reaccreditation process before the certificate expires; or (2) has acquired additional or replacement equipment or has had significant personnel changes or other unforeseen situations that have caused it to be unable to meet reaccreditation time frames but that have not compromised mammography quality.

Authorizes the Secretary, upon the request of an accreditation body, to issue a limited provisional certificate for not more than 72 hours to an entity to conduct examinations for educational purposes during an on-site visit by an accreditation body.

Requires the Secretary to appoint at least two industry representatives with expertise in mammography equipment to the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee. Provides that the Advisory Committee shall meet at least annually. (Current law requires biannual meetings.)

Authorizes appropriations through FY 2007 for breast cancer screening surveillance research grants and for mammography facilities certification activities not supported by fees.</summary>
