Permits the USTR to enter into such an agreement only if the agreement provides for: (1) regulatory standards for drugs that are consistent with the requirements of this Act; (2) a seal, to be placed only by a registered pharmacy, certifying that a given drug meets the standards of the harmonization agreement and may be imported; (3) a unique system of tracking numbers identifying certain entities, including the drug manufacturer and the NAFTA county of origin; (4) the reimbursement by drug manufacturers of the Secretary of Health and Human Services for benefits derived from National Institutes of Health research.\n\nSets a sunset of one year after the passage of this Act for the authority of the USTR to enter into harmonization agreements under this Act."
