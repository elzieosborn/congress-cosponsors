  <summary date="2004-09-22T20:38:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Act of 2004 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance to the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority to assist in planning, designing, conducting pre-construction activities for, and constructing, the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System (a water delivery project designed to deliver approximately 24,000 acre-feet of water per year from the Ute Reservoir to communities located in Quay, Roosevelt, and Curry Counties in eastern New Mexico).

Prohibits assistance from being used: (1) for any activity that is inconsistent with developing the facilities described in the Conceptual Design Report (the System's final report dated August, 2003, as supplemented by the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Conceptual Design Peer Review Final Report dated December 2003), including development of the Logan sewer project described in the Village of Logan Wastewater System Preliminary Engineering Report dated November 2003; and (2) to plan or construct facilities used to supply water to supply irrigation for agricultural purposes.

Sets the Federal cost share at 80 percent. Makes the Authority responsible for the System's annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs. Directs the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Authority to provide specified financial or other assistance requested by the Authority.</summary>
