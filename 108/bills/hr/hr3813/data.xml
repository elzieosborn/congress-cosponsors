Brown Near-Earth Object Survey Act - Requires the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth asteroids and comets at least 100 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects striking the Earth. Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act to declare that the general welfare and security of the United States requires that the unique competence of NASA in science and engineering systems be directed to provide warning and mitigation of the potential hazard of near-Earth objects impacting the Earth.</summary>
