Amends the PHSA to require the Secretary to: (1) designate health centers that receive Federal assistance as Faircare Health Centers if they meet such criteria; and (2) make designated health centers eligible for annual bonuses.\n\nRequires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award grants and carry out activities to expand the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Program (REACH 2010).\n\nSets forth provisions for allowing tax credits and awarding grants for qualified medical malpractice insurance expenditures for eligible health care providers and eligible entities."
