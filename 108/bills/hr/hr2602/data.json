Requires the use of sound science in the preparation of a recovery plan for an endangered or threatened species.\n\nSets forth requirements for: (1) peer review before certain action can become final with respect to endangered or threatened species; and (2) use of information provided by States affected by such species or their habitat for recovery plans."
