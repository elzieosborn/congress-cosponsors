  <summary date="2003-08-06T18:35:33Z" status="Introduced in House">National Resilience Development Act of 2003 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene and lead an interagency task force for the purposes of mitigating distress reactions and maladaptive behaviors in Americans and increasing their psychological resilience in preparation for, and in response to, a conventional, biological, chemical, or radiological attack on the United States. Directs the task force to coordinate and facilitate the efforts of various public bodies to develop programs and protocols to achieve such purposes.

Amends the Act and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA Patriot Act) of 2001 to permit certain grants to go to activities aimed at enabling State mental health authorities, in coordination with State public health authorities and the interagency task force, to better understand and manage human emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses to disasters. States that such efforts shall include increasing the psychological resilience of the public and mitigating distress reactions and maladaptive behaviors that could occur in response to an attack.

Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to integrate into each of its functions of mitigation, planning, response, and recovery, efforts to increase communities' psychological resilience and decrease distress reactions and maladaptive behaviors in individuals. Directs that FEMA take such measures in coordination with the interagency task force and other efforts by the Department of Homeland Security.</summary>
