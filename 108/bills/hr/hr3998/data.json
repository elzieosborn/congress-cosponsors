    "text": "Au Pair Program Extension Act - Directs the Secretary of State to establish a pilot program under which current Department of State-designated au pair program sponsors may place foreign nationals in positions that require in-home independent living services to an adult with disabilities rather than child care services. (Terminates such pilot program not earlier than five years after the date it begins.)\n\nDirects the Secretary of State to: (1) define in-home independent living services to include only home support services such as personal care, homemaker services, and performance of routine household chores, and to exclude medical care or other services to be delivered by licensed health professionals or under the direction of a physical or occupational therapist; (2) ensure that all cultural exchange and educational aspects of the existing au pair exchange programs are unimpaired; and (3) establish standards to ensure that pilot program participants receive appropriate training. Authorizes the Secretary to expand the age range of pilot program candidates."
