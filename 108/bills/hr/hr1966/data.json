Defines \"eligible country\" in terms of poverty, commitment to democracy, economic freedom, and investment in its people (including educational opportunity and access to health care).\n\nEstablishes a Millennium Challenge Account for the receipt of funds authorized under this Act.\n\nEstablishes in the executive branch the Millennium Challenge Corporation to implement the assistance provided under this Act."
