    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAmtrak Reauthorization Act of 2003 - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize appropriations for Amtrak for FY 2004 through 2006 for: (1) capital expenditures; (2) certain mandatory payments; and (3) Amtrak's contractual obligations for commuter and State-supported passenger rail service.\n\nIncludes among mandatory Amtrak payments to the Treasury: (1) an amount equal to the tax Amtrak must pay as an employer under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act that is more than the amount needed for anticipated benefits for retirees and their beneficiaries; (2) amounts necessary to pay the contribution for employee unemployment benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act that are more than its obligations calculated on an experience-related basis; and (3) amounts necessary to pay railroad unemployment repayment taxes.\n\nRequires Amtrak to transmit to the Secretary of Transportation annually a comprehensive business plan, including targets for ridership and for each intercity train route (including Autotrain), revenues, and capital and operating expenses, and supplemental reports describing the work completed to date, any changes to the business plan, and the reasons for such changes.\n\nProhibits the use of amounts appropriated under this Act to subsidize operating losses of commuter rail passenger or rail freight transportation."
