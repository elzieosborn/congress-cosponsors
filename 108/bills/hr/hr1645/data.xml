  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a research, development, and demonstration program in genetics, protein science, and computational biology of microbes and plants to support the energy and environmental mission of the Department. Provides that the program shall support individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams of investigators through competitive, merit-reviewed grants.Establishes as the program goal developing technologies and methods, based on the biological functions of microbes and plants, that: (1) can facilitate the production of fuels; (2) convert carbon dioxide to organic carbon; and (3) detoxify soils and water at DOE facilities contaminated with heavy metals and radiological materials. Requires the Secretary to: (1) transmit to Congress a research plan describing how the program will accomplish that goal; (2) contract with the National Academy of Sciences to review the plan; and (3) transmit the review to Congress along with the Secretary's response to recommendations.Prohibits the Secretary from conducting biomedical research in carrying out such program.</summary>
