    "text": "American Wetland Restoration Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize the Secretary of the Army to issue mitigation bank (specified wetland resource restoration, creation, or enhancement projects or projects consisting solely of preservation of wetlands chartered by the Secretary for purposes of providing mitigation credits to offset wetland losses authorized by permits allowing activities in U.S. waters) charters.Authorizes a mitigation bank, upon receipt of its charter, to offer mitigation credits for sale and to provide compensatory mitigation for activities requiring authorization under the Act or provide required injunctive relief in an enforcement action by the Secretary or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to establish standards and criteria applicable to the use of on-site mitigation, in lieu fees, and other off-site mitigation as compensatory mitigation that are similar to those applicable to a mitigation bank.Allows a State that operates an approved program regulating the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters to administer a wetland mitigation banking program in accordance with State procedures if such banking program is approved by the Administrator as part of the State's dredged or fill material program."
