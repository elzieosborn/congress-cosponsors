Federal Employees Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 - Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish and administer programs through which current and retired Federal employees and their family members and dependents may obtain enhanced dental and vision benefits to supplement those available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB).

Authorizes OPM to prescribe reasonable minimum standards for enhanced dental and vision benefits. Allows a full range of dental benefits, including diagnostic, preventive, emergency care, restorative, oral and maxillofacial surgery, endodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, and orthodontics. Allows for diagnostic and preventive vision benefits, including eyewear.

Requires Federal employees to be responsible for 100 percent of the premiums for dental and vision coverage offered under this Act. Imposes requirements for studies, reports, and audits relating to the dental and vision benefit programs established under this Act.

Extends the enhanced dental and vision benefits provided by this Act to employees of the U.S. Postal Service.

Expresses the sense of Congress that Federal employee health insurance benefits should be sufficient to promote the health and productivity of such employees and to support the recruitment and retention of a highly qualified workforce. Urges Congress to evaluate such supplemental dental and vision plans to determine the options for, and feasibility of, providing an employer contribution.

Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to report to Congress on options: (1) for extending health insurance coverage under FEHB to unmarried dependent college students under age 25; and (2) for extending hearing benefits to Federal employees and annuitants, their relatives, and other appropriate classes of individuals.</summary>
