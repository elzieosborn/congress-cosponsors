  <summary date="2004-10-22T18:57:52Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Amends the Department of Agriculture Organic Act of 1944 to make Forest Service appropriations available to cover the cost of primary and secondary schooling (which may include transportation costs) of dependents of Forest Service personnel who are stationed in Puerto Rico and are subject to transfer to other U.S. locations if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the area schools are unable to provide adequately for such dependents' education.

States that such coverage shall not exceed costs authorized by the Department of Defense for the same area for armed forces' dependents.</summary>
