Permits a person who meets applicable legal requirements to be an importer of drugs to import (without regard to whether the person is a manufacturer of the drug) certain Food and Drug Administration-approved new drugs, which are neither adulterated nor misbranded, and which require a prescription, if the person submits an drug import application and the Secretary approves the application.Prohibits the Secretary from taking any action under the FDCA with respect to the interstate sale of a prescription drug through an Internet site, if the sale was made in compliance with the FDCA and with applicable State laws, and accurate information regarding compliance with the FDCA and such State laws is posted on the site."
