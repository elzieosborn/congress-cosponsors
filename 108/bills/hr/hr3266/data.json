Directs the Secretary, in awarding covered grants, to assist States and local governments in achieving the essential capabilities for first responders. Directs that for purposes of awarding covered grants, credibility of the threat shall be weighted more than population concentration, critical infrastructure, or any other consideration.\n\nDirects the Secretary to require that any State applying for a covered grant submit a three-year State homeland security plan that: (1) demonstrates the extent to which the State has achieved, and what is still needed for the State to achieve, the applicable essential capabilities; (2) describes the extent to which the State used a specified methodology to evaluate the level of its essential capabilities; (3) includes a prioritization of such additional needs based on threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessment factors; (4) describes how the State intends to address such additional needs at the city, county, regional, State, and interstate level (and with respect to any Indian tribes within its boundaries), with particular emphasis on regional planning and cooperation within its jurisdictional borders and with neighboring States; and (5) is developed in consultation with and subject to appropriate comment by local governments.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from awarding any covered grant to a State unless the Secretary has approved its homeland security plan. Directs the Secretary to ensure that each covered grant is used to supplement and support the applicable State's homeland security plan.\n\nSets forth application requirements and deadlines and requirements regarding equipment standards. Limits the Secretary to making covered grants directly to not more than 20 directly eligible tribes per fiscal year.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a First Responder Grants Board, consisting of: (1) the Secretary; (2) the Under Secretaries for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Border and Transportation Security, Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, and Science and Technology; and (6) the Director of the Office for Preparedness. Designates the Secretary as Chairman of the Board. Directs the Board to evaluate and annually prioritize all pending applications for covered grants based upon the degree to which they would lessen the threat to, vulnerability of, and consequences for persons and critical infrastructure, and to ensure that, for each fiscal year: (1) the States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico each receive no less than .25 percent of the funds available for covered grants for implementing its homeland security plan in accordance with the prioritization of additional needs; (2) the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands each receive no less than .08 percent of the funds available for covered grants for such purposes; and (3) directly eligible tribes collectively receive no less than .25 percent of the funds available for covered grants for purposes of addressing needs identified in their applications, consistent with the homeland security plan of each State within which any part of any such tribe is located.\n\nSpecified used of covered grants, including: (1) equipment and exercises to strengthen terrorism preparedness and response; (2) training for prevention of, preparedness for, or response to attacks involving weapons of mass destruction; (3) response plans; (4) mechanisms for sharing terrorism threat information; (5) strategy formulation and strategic planning and prototype development for terrorism preparedness and response purposes; (6) additional personnel costs resulting from elevations in the Homeland Security Advisory System threat alert level; (7) enhancing facilities to serve as operations centers or hardening critical infrastructure against potential attack; (8) commercially available equipment that facilitates coordination and integration between emergency communications systems; (9) educational curricula development for first responders; and (10) training and exercises to assist public elementary and secondary schools in developing and implementing terrorism response programs. Prohibits funds from being used: (1) to supplant State or local funds for traditional missions of State and local law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical services, or public health agencies; (2) to construct buildings or other physical physical facilities; (3) to acquire land; or (4) for any State or local government cost-sharing contribution.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from requesting that equipment paid for with covered grant funds be made available for responding to emergencies in surrounding States, regions, and localities, unless the Secretary pays the costs of transporting and operating such equipment.\n\nAllows the Secretary to authorize a covered grant recipient, upon request, transfer grant funds from uses specified in the grant agreement to other uses authorized in this Act if such transfer is in the interests of homeland security.\n\nDirects the Secretary to require a recipient that is a State to make available to local governments, first responders, and other local groups, to the extent required under the State homeland security plan, not less than 80 percent of the grant funds, equivalent resources purchased with the grant funds, or a combination thereof within 45 days after receiving the grant funds.\n\nLimits the Federal share of the cost of an activity carried out with a covered grant to a State or region to 100 percent with respect to grants awarded within two years after this Act's enactment or 75 percent with respect to grants awarded thereafter. Allows each recipient to meet the matching requirement by making in-kind contributions of goods or services that are directly linked with the grant's purpose. Requires any State recipient to certify to the Secretary, within 30 days, that it has made the required amount of grant funds available to local governments, groups, and first responders.\n\nSets forth annual reporting requirements by recipients on homeland security spending, including restricted annexes (for sensitive but unclassified information). Requires: (1) each recipient of a covered grant that is a directly eligible tribe to simultaneously submit its report to each State within which any part of such tribe is located; and (2) the Secretary to ensure that each report is provided to the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response and the Director of the Office for Domestic Preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary, if a State recipient fails to pass through funds or resources to local governments, groups, or first responders within 45 days after receiving grant funds, to: (1) reduce grant payments; (2) transfer payment of funds directly to local first responders; or (3) impose additional restrictions on the State's use of grant funds. Authorizes the Governor of a State to request and the Secretary to grant a 15-day extension of such 45-day period if the resulting delay will not have a significant detrimental impact on terrorism preparedness efforts. Authorizes the Secretary to pay a local government, upon request, a portion of the amount awarded to a State for such government to use to expedite planned terrorism preparedness enhancements if the State has failed to pass through funds or resources.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit an annual report to Congress by December 31 of each year on the amount of Federal funds provided as covered grants to each State and region, the use of such grant funds, and the extent to which essential capabilities were created or enhanced or remain unmet, and an estimate of Federal, State, and local expenditures required to attain such capabilities across the United States.\n\nDirects the Secretary to support the development of, promulgate, and update national voluntary consensus standards for: (1) the performance, use, and validation of first responder equipment, which shall be consistent with existing standards, take into account new types of terrorism threats, and focus on maximizing interoperability, interchangeability, durability, flexibility, efficiency, efficacy, portability, sustainability, and safety; and (2) first responder training under covered grant programs that will enable State and local government first responders to achieve optimal levels of terrorism preparedness as quickly as practicable.
