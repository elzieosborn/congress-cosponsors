  <summary date="2005-01-05T20:36:37Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on September 13, 2004. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make available to the University of Miami real property under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Virginia Key, Florida, for development by the University for a Marine Life Science Center. Allows the Secretary to make that property available by easement, lease, license, or long-term agreement with the University.

Authorizes the use of the property to develop and operate facilities for multidisciplinary environmental and fisheries research, assessment, management, and educational activities. Prohibits the property from being used by the University (including any affiliate of the University) except in accordance with an agreement with the Secretary as described in this Act. Terminates the availability of such property immediately upon use of it by the University for any other purpose or in violation of the agreement.

Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement to occupy facilities constructed by the University on such property, and to participate with the University in collaborative research at, or administered through, such facilities.

Prohibits this Act from being construed to convey or authorize conveyance of any interest of the United States in title to property made available under this Act.</summary>
