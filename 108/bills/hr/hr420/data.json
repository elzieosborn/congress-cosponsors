Provides for annual land use fee adjustments.Reduces the land-use fee, but not below a minimum amount to be determined by the Secretary, for: (1) use by persons with disabilities and at-risk children; and (2) youth programs through organized social, citizenship, character-building, or faith-based activities oriented to outdoor recreation. Prohibits facility use fee reductions.Provides for an additional fee if an organizational camp derives revenue from such lands' or facilities' use for purposes other than to introduce young people or people with disabilities to natural resource education or other appropriate experiences."
