Makes basic grants available to States that provide for at least one of five enumerated programs aimed at enforcing laws against drug impaired driving.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to use certain funds for research and development in drug detection and testing technology.\n\nSpecifies certain training goals to enhance the State's ability to detect, enforce, and prosecute drug impaired driving laws."
