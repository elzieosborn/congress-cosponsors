    "text": "Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2004 - (Sec. 3) Directs the President to establish a Green Chemistry Research and Development Program to promote and coordinate Federal research, development, demonstration, education, and technology transfer activities related to green chemistry. Defines green chemistry as chemistry and and chemical engineering to design chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances.\n\nRequires that program activities be designed to: (1) provide, as specified, sustained support for green chemistry research, development, demonstration, education, and technology transfer; (2) examine methods by which the Federal Government can create incentives for use of green chemistry processes and products; (3) facilitate the adoption of green chemistry innovations; (4) expand education and training of undergraduate and graduate students and professional chemists and chemical engineers in green chemistry science and engineering; (5) collect and disseminate information on green chemistry research, development, and technology transfer, including incentives and impediments to development and commercialization; (6) support economic, legal, and other appropriate social science research to identify barriers to commercialization and methods to advance commercialization of green chemistry; and (7) provide for public input and outreach to be integrated into the Program by the convening of public discussions.\n\nRequires the President to establish an Interagency Working Group, which shall include representatives from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and any other agency that the President may designate, to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program. Assigns the Director of the NSF and the Assistant Administrator for R&D of the EPA to serve as co-chairs of the Working Group. Directs the Working Group to: (1) establish goals and priorities for the Program in consultation with green chemistry researchers and potential end-users of green chemistry products and processes; and (2) provide for interagency coordination of activities under the Program. Directs each Federal agency and department participating in the Program, as part of its annual request for appropriations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to submit a report to OMB which identifies its activities that contribute directly to the Program and states the portion of its request that is allocated to those activities. Requires the President to include in his annual budget request to Congress a statement of the portion of each agency's or department's annual budget request allocated to its activities undertaken pursuant to the Program. Requires the Working Group to transmit a report to specified congressional committees which includes: (1) a summary of federally funded green chemistry research, development, demonstration, education, and technology transfer activities; and (2) an analysis of the progress made toward achieving the Program's goals and priorities, and recommendations for future Program activities.\n\n(Sec. 4) Amends the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to revise the date for the transmission of the biennial report assessing the participation of women and minorities in scientific and engineering positions and in scientific and engineering education.\n\n(Sec. 5) Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to provide for the Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology to enhance productivity and technological performance in U.S. manufacturing through the enabling of supply chain manufacturers to continuously improve products and processes, increase energy efficiency, identify cost-saving opportunities, and optimize resources and technologies with the aim of reducing or eliminating the use or generation of hazardous substances.\n\n(Sec. 6) Requires the Director of the NSF to carry out a program to award grants to institutions of higher education to support their efforts to revise their undergraduate curriculum in chemistry and chemical engineering to incorporate green chemistry concepts and strategies. Requires: (1) such grants to be awarded on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis; and (2) cost-sharing in cash from non-Federal sources, to match the Federal funding. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2007 for carrying out such grant program.\n\n(Sec. 7) Requires the Director of the NSF to enter into an arrangement with the National Research Council to conduct a study of the factors that constitute barriers to the successful commercial application of promising results from green chemistry R&D. Requires such study to: (1) examine successful and unsuccessful attempts at commercialization of green chemistry in the United States and abroad; and (2) recommend research areas and priorities and public policy options that would help to overcome identified barriers to commercialization. Requires such Director to submit a report to specified congressional committees on the findings and recommendations of such study.\n\n(Sec 8) Authorizes appropriations through FY 2007 for the: (1) NSF; (2) FIST; (3) DOE; and (4) EPA."
