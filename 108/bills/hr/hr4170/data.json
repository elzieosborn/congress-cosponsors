Authorizes the Secretary to accept the services of individuals in hazardous duty only upon a determination by the Secretary that such individuals are skilled in performing hazardous activities. Directs the Secretary to ensure that an appropriate U.S. officer or employee provides adequate and appropriate supervision of each volunteer whose services the Secretary accepts.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to provide for services and costs incidental to the utilization of volunteers. Provides that a volunteer shall not be deemed a Federal employee and shall not be subject to Federal employment law including those provisions relating to hours of work, rates of compensation, leave, unemployment compensation, and Federal employee benefits. Provides for volunteers under this Act to be subject to the provisions of Federal criminal law concerning bribery, graft, and conflicts of interest, except under certain conditions."
