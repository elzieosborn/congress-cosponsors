  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Access and Openness in Small Business Lending Act of 2003 - Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to require a depository institution, in the case of an application for credit made by a small business, to: (1) inquire whether the business is a women- or minority-owned business; and (2) maintain a record of the responses to such inquiry separate from the application and accompanying information. Allows any applicant to refuse to provide such information. Prohibits: (1) access to such information by any loan underwriter, officer, employee, or affiliate of the depository institution; and (2) the depository institution from including personally identifiable information in such record of responses. Requires such information to be made available to Federal enforcement agencies. Exempts from such requirements institutions having total assets equal to or less than the exemption amount determined under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975.</summary>
