    "text": "Veterans Entrepreneurship and Benefits Improvement Act of 2003 - Authorizes a State agency to approve entrepreneurship (business education) courses for attendance by veterans using veterans' basic educational assistance provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from treating a business owner as already qualified for such purposes. Includes entrepreneurship courses within authorized programs of veterans' education assistance.Amends the Small Business Act to authorize a Federal contracting officer to award a sole source contract to any small business owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans if: (1) the business is determined to be responsible with respect to the performance of the contract opportunity and the contracting officer does not expect two or more such businesses to submit offers for such contract; (2) the anticipated award price of the contract will not exceed a specified amount; and (3) the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. Allows a contracting officer to restrict contract competition to such businesses if the officer can reasonably expect two or more such businesses to submit offers. Allows for the appeal by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration of a contracting officer's decision not to award a contract opportunity to such a business.Authorizes the Secretary to provide adapted housing assistance to certain categories of disabled military personnel (having suffered loss of limbs, organs, partial blindness or deafness, etc.) serving on active duty if the disability is the result of an injury or disease contracted or aggravated during such duty.Increases from 65 to 85 the percentage of the number of purchases during a fiscal year of real property acquired by the Secretary as a result of default on guaranteed loans for the purchase or construction of homes for veterans that may be financed by a loan made by the Secretary.Requires the payment of all accrued monetary benefits (currently limited to two years' worth) of a deceased veteran's beneficiary to the veteran or any other surviving dependent."
