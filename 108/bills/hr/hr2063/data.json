Requires the Secretary to submit a justification within 72 hours after any such immediate expenditure.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report to Congress on the advisability of establishing new cooperative threat reduction programs to account for projects or activities funded under this Act if the Secretary uses such funds for two consecutive years."
