Allows sanctions to be lifted only if the Belarusian Government meets specific democratic conditions. Affirms solidarity with the democratic forces in Belarus and calls upon the Government of Belarus to permit basic freedoms and allow free, fair and transparent presidential and parliamentary elections. Calls upon the Russian Government to use its influence to encourage democratic development in Belarus so that it can become an independent state that is integrated into Europe."
