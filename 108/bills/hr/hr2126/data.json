Designates such grants as \"Teague Grants\" in honor of Olin E. Teague, the most decorated veteran ever to have served in Congress.\n\nReauthorizes and extends the grant program for FY 2005 through 2009. Includes within criteria for grant approval a determination that proposed projects and programs will increase the number of medical and nursing students attending the affiliated school. Directs the Secretary to give a priority in grant awards to medical schools established under the Act."
