  <summary date="2004-03-12T17:57:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Atlantic Striped Bass Protection Act of 2003 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study and report to Congress on data gathered by observers on fishing vessels to: (1) map migratory patterns, wintering areas, and feeding grounds of Atlantic Striped Bass in the waters of the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone; and (2) identify and map locations in which deployed gear caught or discarded Atlantic Striped Bass in excess of ten percent of the target species landed on the same trip.

Requires the Secretary, based on study findings, to promulgate regulations under the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act that establish conservation and management measures to minimize the bycatch and mortality of bycatch of Atlantic Striped Bass caught in non-directed commercial fishing in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone. Requires such regulations to include temporary closure of any identified location in which there is a particularly high level of Atlantic Striped Bass in non-directed commercial fishing, under which the deployment of net, finfish trap, or longline gear by any vessel fishing under a Federal fishing permit shall be prohibited.</summary>
