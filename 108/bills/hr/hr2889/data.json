Requires such regulations to include temporary closure of any identified location in which there is a particularly high level of Atlantic Striped Bass in non-directed commercial fishing, under which the deployment of net, finfish trap, or longline gear by any vessel fishing under a Federal fishing permit shall be prohibited."
