Prescribes notification procedures.\n\nAuthorizes a customer injured by a violation of this Act to institute a civil action to recover damages.\n\nAmends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require a consumer reporting agency to include a fraud alert in a consumer file: (1) upon notification by financial institution; and (2) upon consumer request.\n\nRequires a consumer reporting agency to ensure that each person procuring credit information with respect to a consumer is made aware of the existence of a fraud alert in the consumer's file, regardless of whether a full credit report, credit score, or summary report is requested.\n\nMandates no-cost consumer access to credit reports and scores once during each calendar year and once every three months during the one-year period beginning on the date on which a fraud alert is included in the consumer file.\n\nDirects the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate implementing regulations."
