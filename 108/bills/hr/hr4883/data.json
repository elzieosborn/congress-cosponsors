(Current law covers physical disruption but not economic disruption.)\n\nIncreases penalties for economic damage. Sets penalties for economic damage or disruption exceeding $100,000. Provides for imposition of the death penalty where a person causes the death of an individual in the course of a violation of code provisions regarding animal enterprise terrorism.\n\nIncludes animal enterprise terrorism within the scope of offenses for which interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications is authorized."
