Requires the President to terminate the designation of any beneficiary country determined no longer to meet such requirements.\n\nAuthorizes the President to designate the Palestinian Authority or its successor political entity as a beneficiary political entity accorded benefits under this Act as if it were a beneficiary country, if the Authority; (1) meets the first two requirements of this Act; (2) does not participate in acts of terrorism, and takes active measures to combat terrorism; (3) cooperates fully in international efforts to combat terrorism; (4) does not engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, and is making continuing and verifiable progress on the protection of internationally recognized human rights; and (5) accepts Israel's right to exist in peace within secure borders.\n\nPrescribes the rule of origin for tents imported directly from beneficiary countries. Requires that the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in one or more beneficiary countries, plus the direct cost of processing operations performed in such beneficiary country or countries, be at least 35 percent of the appraised value of such article at the time it is entered into the U.S. customs territory."
