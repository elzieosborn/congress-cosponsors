Declares that the purposes of the program shall be to: (1) facilitate and support multimodal freight transportation initiatives at the State, regional, and local levels to improve freight transportation gateways and mitigate congestion in the area of such gateways; (2) provide capital funding to address infrastructure and freight operational needs at freight transportation corridors and gateways; (3) encourage adoption of new financing strategies to leverage State, local, and private investment in freight transportation gateways; and (4) support military mobilization and readiness.

Qualifies for funding under this Act intermodal freight transportation projects that provide community and highway benefits by addressing economic, congestion, security, safety, and environmental issues associated with freight transportation corridors and gateways, subject to specified limitations. Sets forth project selection and grant approval criteria. Requires a recipient of Federal financial assistance for a project with an estimated total cost of $100 million or more to submit to the Secretary an annual financial plan for the project.
