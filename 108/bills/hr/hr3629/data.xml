  <summary date="2003-12-30T16:49:30Z" status="Introduced in House">Arsenic-Treated Wood Prohibition Act - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations prohibiting the use of arsenic-treated wood (wood treated with a pesticide that is a chromated copper arsenical or another arsenical pesticide) in the manufacture of any product that may be used for or by children or for mulch, compost, a soil amendment, certain other construction and utility uses, and additional uses as determined to be appropriate.

Requires the Administrator to conduct an assessment of the risks posed by the production, processing, and use of CCA-treated wood (wood treated with a pesticide that is a chromated copper arsenical).

 Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to: (1) list arsenic-treated wood as a hazardous waste; and (2) require disposal of discarded arsenic-treated wood in a lined landfill with a leachate system and groundwater monitoring system.

Requires the Administrator to: (1) develop and conduct an educational program to assist consumers, State and local governments, school systems, and other institutions in testing arsenic levels and making decisions concerning arsenic-treated wood containment, removal, and decontamination; and (2) establish a pilot program of grants and technical assistance to assist school systems in removal of playground and other equipment containing arsenic-treated wood and remediation activities.

 Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to report to Congress on its efforts to identify measures (including stains and sealants) for reducing children's exposure to arsenic from products or structures constructed with arsenic-treated wood that will remain in use after the prohibition established by this Act.</summary>
