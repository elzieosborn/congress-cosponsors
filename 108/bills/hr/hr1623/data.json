    "text": "Presidential Gifts Accountability Act - Directs the Archivist of the United States to maintain a current inventory of all presidential gifts.Requires the head of a Federal office or agency to report to the Archivist any information regarding a presidential gift.Requires the Archivist to: (1) make inventory information available to the public; (2) disclose to the public additional information regarding each gift from any person who makes presidential gifts in a year having a cumulative value of $100 or more; and (3) report to specified congressional committees on each disposition of a gift other than a gift from a relative or a gift having a value of less than $100.Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to prohibit the President and any spouse from: (1) accepting any gift of stock in a corporation or any gift certificate; (2) accepting gifts from a single source in a year having a cumulative value greater than $1,000, except a personalized, honorific award; (3) accepting any gift beginning on the date of a presidential election occurring during the President's term and ending on the date of the beginning of the next presidential term, unless the President is reelected for that next term; or (4) soliciting or coordinating, or seeking another to solicit or coordinate, the making of any gift to the President or spouse. Requires any gift wrongfully accepted to be returned or to become property of the United States and not deposited in a presidential archival depository. Makes this section inapplicable with respect to gifts from a foreign government or a relative."
