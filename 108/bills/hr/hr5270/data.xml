  <summary date="2004-12-23T21:52:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Education for Public Service Act of 2004 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise certain student loan income contingent repayment plan requirements with respect to public service employees and married borrowers.

Provides public service employees with a shortened maximum student loan repayment period before receiving debt forgiveness under an income contingent repayment plan. Prohibits the Secretary of Education from prescribing such a repayment period exceeding 15 years (instead of the usual 25 years) in the case of those borrowers who, after electing such a plan, have been full-time public service employees for at least eight years, whether or not continuously.

Revises income contingent student loan repayment schedules for married borrowers to attribute to the borrower one-half (rather than all) of the combined adjusted gross income of the borrower and the borrower's spouse.</summary>
