    "text": "Federal Death Care Disclosure Act - Classifies as deceptive trade practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act funeral provider practices that: (1) fail to make timely price disclosures regarding funeral goods and services; (2) fail to give an itemized written statement to a purchaser of funeral goods or services at the conclusion of the discussion related to such goods or services and prior to providing any services beyond taking possession of a deceased human body for embalming; (3) make specified misrepresentations concerning funeral goods and services; (4) condition the furnishing of goods and services upon the purchase of other goods and services; (5) provide embalming services without prior approval (except in specified circumstances); (6) involve unsolicited telephone offers or door-to-door direct offers to sell funeral goods or services, crematory services, interment rights, or other cemetery and memorialization goods or services; (7) fail to comply with specified requirements governing cash advance items; and (8) fail to comply with specified prepaid contract requirements. Directs the Commission to establish minimum standards concerning State mandated consumer disclosures in prepaid contracts for the purchase of funeral, cemetery, or crematory goods or services. Establishes a private right of action for persons injured by a violation of this Act. Exempts States with a comparable or greater level of consumer protection from application of this Act or related regulations."
