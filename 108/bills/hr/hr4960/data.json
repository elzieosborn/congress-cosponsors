Provides that: (1) any resultant CCC losses shall not be charged to the No Net Cost Tobacco Account, and shall not affect the amount of certain Flue-cured or Burley tobacco assessments; and (2) forfeited tobacco shall not be counted for the Flue-cured or Burley tobacco quota, nor sold for use in the United States, except that the CCC may market directly or through the use of U.S. leaf dealers such tobacco outside the United States."
