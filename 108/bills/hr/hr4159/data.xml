  <summary date="2004-05-19T21:30:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Drug Impaired Driving Research and Prevention Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to develop and provide to the States a model statute relating to drug impaired driving which incorporates certain mandatory and discretionary provisions, including, at a minimum, a provision that the crime of drug impaired driving is committed when a person operates a motor vehicle: (1) while any detectable amount of a controlled substance is present in the person's body; or (2) due to the presence of a controlled substance or a controlled substance in combination with alcohol or an inhalant, or both, the person's mental or physical faculties are affected to a noticeable degree.

Specifies discretionary provisions, including: (1) sanctions for refusing to submit to a drug test which are equivalent to sanctions for a positive test result; (2) a graduated system of penalties for repeat offenses; (3) authorization for States to suspend or revoke the license of a driver convicted of driving while under the influence of a controlled substance; and (4) a system of evaluation, counseling, treatment, and supervision for persons convicted of drug impaired driving.

Authorizes the Secretary to use certain funds for research and development in drug detection and testing technology.

Specifies certain training goals to enhance the State's ability to detect, enforce, and prosecute drug impaired driving laws.

Requires the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to advise and coordinate with other Federal agencies on how to address the problem of driving under the influence of an illegal drug, and to conduct research on the prevention, detection, and prosecution of driving under the influence of an illegal drug.</summary>
