    "text": "Clean Coal Power Act of 2003 - Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) perform an assessment that identifies cost and performance goals of technologies permitting continued cost-competitive use of coal for electricity generation, as chemical feedstocks, and as transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and the years after 2020; and (2) implement a technology research, development, and demonstration program to facilitate production and generation of coal-based power through methods and equipment under designated statutes.Prescribes conditions and criteria for the authorization of appropriations for a clean coal power initiative program.Instructs the Secretary to: (1) fund coal energy generation projects that advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness well beyond the level of technologies in operation as of the date of enactment of this Act; and (2) award competitive, merit-based grants to universities for the establishment of Centers of Excellence for Energy Systems of the Future.Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish income tax credits for investment in and for production from a qualifying advanced clean coal technology facility.Prescribes guidelines for the treatment of persons not able to use the entire credit relating to clean coal technology."
