Removes the cap on such projects (currently, limited to 20 pilot projects nationwide).\n\nRequires the Secretary, after the enactment of this Act and every three years thereafter, to evaluate and make recommendations regarding the projects.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for each fiscal year through FY 2009.\n\nAmends the Act to authorize the Secretary to negotiate and enter into a cooperative agreement with a partner organization, academic institution, State or local government agency, or other person to implement one or more projects or programs for a refuge or complex of geographically related refuges in accordance with the purposes of the Act and in compliance with the policies of other relevant authorities, regulations, and policy guidance."
