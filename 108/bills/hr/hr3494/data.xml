Directs the Commission to consider: (1) the ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet anticipated long term surface transportation financing needs; (2) the roles of the various levels of government and the private sector; (3) administrative costs; (4) potential taxpayer privacy concerns; (5) likely technological advances; (6) alternative transportation vehicles, including alternative-fueled vehicles; (7) the equity and economic efficiency of each option; (8) the flexibility of different options to allow various pricing alternatives to be implemented; and (9) potential compatibility issues with States' tax mechanisms.</summary>
