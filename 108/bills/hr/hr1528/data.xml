  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Passed House amended">Taxpayer Protection and IRS Accountability Act of 2003 - Title I: Penalty And Interest Reforms - (Sec. 101) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to raise the figure of adjusted income below which no penalty is incurred for underpayment of estimated taxes. Includes equally-paid estimated tax in calculus of adjusted income as well as tax withheld, thus including in the "safe harbor" individuals who pay throughout the year only through estimated tax.Establishes that the underpayment interest rate in effect on the first day of the quarter in which a pertinent estimated payment due date arises is the interest rate that will apply during the entire underpayment period. Determines that a 365-day year will be used for calculation of all individual, estate, and trust estimated tax interest calculations.(Sec. 102) Excludes from gross income for tax purposes interest paid on overpayments of income tax. Disqualifies a taxpayer from benefitting if the Secretary of the Treasury determines the taxpayer purposely overpaid to earn interest.(Sec. 103) Eliminates the $50,000 threshold for abatement of interest on erroneous refunds. Requires the Secretary to abate interest on underpayments in which the reason for the underpayment is erroneous information supplied in written form by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).(Sec. 104) Creates a system whereby a taxpayer can deposit sums with the IRS that may subsequently be used to pay an underpayment of income or other specified taxes. Establishes that no underpayment interest will be charged on the portion of an underpayment paid in this manner for the period the funds are on deposit. Allows withdrawals unless the amount has been used to pay tax or the Secretary believes that withdrawal will jeopardize tax payment. Specifies that interest will only be paid on withdrawals from deposits attributable to a disputable tax.(Sec. 105) Applies, for individual taxpayers, interest netting rules without regard to the 45-day period in which the Secretary may refund an overpayment of tax without the payment of interest.(Sec. 106) Permits the IRS to waive certain penalties for unintentional minor errors that are committed by a taxpayer with a history of tax compliance and the penalty for which would be grossly disproportionate to the action.(Sec. 107) Increases from $500 to $5,000 the penalty the IRS will impose for filing a frivolous income tax return, unless the Secretary deems it appropriate to lessen the penalty. Applies the penalty to all taxpayers and to all types of Federal taxes.(Sec. 108) Establishes that the 10 percent penalty on required Federal tax deposits applies only to cases where an individual has failed to deposit for more than 15 days.Title II: Fairness of Collection Procedures - (sec. 201) Stipulates that the IRS may enter into installment agreements with taxpayers that do not provide for full payment of liabilities.

Requires the contribution to be to the same type of IRA from which the amounts were withdrawn. Stipulates that in such a scenario any tax on the withdrawal from the IRA is abated. Interest paid by the IRS to the taxpayer is considered part of the original payment and is not counted as gross income.(Sec. 204) Modifies the suspension date of the statute of limitations for taxpayers suffering significant hardship by applying it only if the date of the decision by the National Taxpayer Advocate is at least seven days after the date of the taxpayer's application.(Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary to study IRS practices concerning liens and levies.Title III: Tax Administration Reforms - (Sec. 301) Requires the Commissioner of the IRS to issue guidelines for discipline, including for firing employees, and to take action for certain violations.

Terminates this provision December 31, 2005.(Sec. 306) Permits the National Taxpayer Advocate to appoint a counsel in the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate to report solely to the National Taxpayer Advocate.(Sec. 307) Requires payment of motor fuel excise tax refunds by electronic fund transfers if the payee makes an election and satisfies certain other requirements.(Sec. 308) Provides that in the case of a qualified joint venture conducted by a husband and wife who file a joint return: (1) such joint venture shall not be treated as a partnership; (2) all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit shall be divided between the spouses in accordance with their respective interests in the venture; (3) each spouse shall take into account such spouse's respective share of such items as if they were attributable to a trade or business conducted by such spouse as a sole proprietor.(Sec. 309) Permits, through 2004, State-based coverage to meet the definition of qualified health insurance eligible for the refundable health insurance tax credit for certain eligible individuals electing to waive the guaranteed issue and preexisting condition requirements for State-based coverage.(Sec. 310) Suspends the tax-exempt status of a designated terrorist organization (as defined by this Act). Denies: (1) deductions for contributions made to such an organization; and (2) administrative or judicial challenge to such suspension or denial. Provides for refund or credit in a case of erroneous designation.(Sec. 311) Extends, for five years, the review of the strategic plans and budget by the Joint Committee on Taxation.Title IV: Confidentiality and Disclosure - (Sec. 401) Eliminates the requirement for former spouses to make a written request for disclosure of collection activities with respect to a joint tax return.(Sec. 402) Forbids an IRS employee conducting an examination of a taxpayer from conducting an examination of the taxpayer representative's return solely on the basis of the representative's relationship to the taxpayer.(Sec. 403) Prohibits return or return information of a person not a party to a judicial or administrative proceeding from being disclosed until after the Secretary makes a reasonable effort to inform the person of the intended disclosure and of what parts of the return the person can withhold. Lists exceptions to the new procedure.(Sec. 404) Prohibits the disclosure of the taxpayer's address and taxpayer identification number as part of the publicly available summaries of accepted offers in compromise.(Sec. 405) Requires a State or Federal agency to conduct annual on-site reviews of all of its contractors receiving Federal returns and return information to assess their performance in safeguarding the confidentiality of such information. Requires the State or Federal agency to certify annually that its contractors are in compliance with requirements to safeguard such information.(Sec. 406) Invalidates a taxpayer's consent to supply return information to a third party if the form turned in to the IRS does not designate a recipient or is not dated at the time of execution. Requires taxpayers, under penalty of perjury, to verify when submitting a request to the IRS that the form contains the above information.(Sec. 407) Requires the IRS to notify a taxpayer upon the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration's determination that a taxpayer's return or return information has been disclosed or inspected without authorization.(Sec. 408) Permits the IRS to disclose return information to local law enforcement authorities in response to imminent danger of death or physical injury (previously the IRS was allowed to disclose information only to Federal and State law enforcement).(Sec. 409) Permits the IRS to disclose taxpayer identity information through any means of mass communication to notify persons entitled to tax refunds.(Sec. 410) Permits the Secretary to disclose to an appropriate State officer information related to 501(c)(3) organizations, including: (1) a notice of proposed refusal to recognize an applicant as a 501(c)(3) organization; (2) a notice of proposed revocation of 501(c)(3) status; and (3) names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of organizations applying for 501(c)(3) status.
