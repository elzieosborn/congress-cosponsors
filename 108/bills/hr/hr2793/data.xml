Declares that the alternative lands shall become part of the Tribe's reservation immediately upon attaining trust status and to be taken into trust as part of the settlement and extinguishment of the Tribe's claims to Charlotte Beach lands in Michigan. Deems such alternative lands to be lands obtained in settlement of a land claim under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (thus exempt from a certain prohibition against gaming).</summary>
