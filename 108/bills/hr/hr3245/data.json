    "text": "Commercial Space Act of 2003 - Amends the Commercial Space Launch Act (CSLA) to prohibit CSLA license holders from launching or reentering a spaceflight participant unless: (1) the participant has received training and met medical or other standards specified in the license; (2) the participant is informed of the safety record of the launch or reentry vehicle type; and (3) the launch or reentry vehicle is marked to distinguish it from an aircraft in a manner specified by the Secretary of Transportation.\n\nRequires the Secretary to create, and report to Congress on progress in implementing, a streamlined, cost-effective, and enabling regulatory framework for the U.S. commercial human spaceflight industry.\n\nExtends current indemnification provisions for commercial space transportation through calendar 2007.\n\nRequires the Secretary to arrange with the National Academy of Public Administration to study and report to Congress on the liability risk-sharing regime for U.S. commercial space transportation.\n\nRedesignates the Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commercialization as the Office of Space Commerce (OSC).\n\nRequires the Secretary of Commerce to delegate to the Director of OSC the Secretary's licensing authority for private remote sensing space systems (satellite photo systems). Amends the Technology Administration Act of 1998 to reflect this delegation of authority and to give the Director of OSC responsibility for serving as Executive Secretary for the Interagency Global Positioning System Executive Board."
