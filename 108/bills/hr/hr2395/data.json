States that such guidelines shall not apply in 2003 for grazing activities for which the Secretary is unable to provide alternative arrangements in specified allotments on the Humboldt-Toiyabe, Lassen, Plumas, Tahoe, Stanislaus, and Sierra National Forests.Authorizes the Secretary to provide certain environmental exclusions for such alternative grazing arrangements without first administratively establishing an applicable category of excluded actions."
