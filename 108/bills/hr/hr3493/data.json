(Current law requires a country to recognize both types of inspections.)\n\nAllows the Secretary to withdraw eligibility for third party inspections from a company if the Secretary obtains information indicating significant deviations from compliance with the Act or implementing regulations.\n\nAllows electronic labeling for prescription devices intended for use by health care professionals and for in vitro diagnostic devices intended for use by health care professionals or in blood establishments.\n\nDelays by 18 additional months the effective date of the provision deeming a device misbranded if the identification of the manufacturer is not conspicuously displayed.\n\nDirects the Secretary to submit a report to the relevant committees on the barriers to the availability of devices intended for treatment or diagnosis of diseases or conditions that affect children."
