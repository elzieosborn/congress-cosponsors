    "text": "Hawaii Agriculture/Livestock Shipping Open Market Act of 2003 - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, to make the requirement that all cargo shipping between U.S. ports occur exclusively on U.S. flagged vessels inapplicable with respect to transportation in Hawaii noncontiguous trade of merchandise that is a forest product, agricultural product, or livestock on a foreign qualified freight vessel for which the Secretary of Transportation has issued a certificate of documentation.\n\nAmends the Shipping Act, 1916, to repeal certain requirements regarding: (1) the percentage of ownership of a corporation operating in coastwise trade owned by U.S. citizens; and (2) seizure and forfeiture of documented vessels.\n\nRequires jurisdiction for an action brought for recovery for injury to or death of a seaman against a defendant employer that does not reside or maintain an office in the United States and that engages in any enterprise that makes use of one or more ports in the United States to be under the district court most proximate to the place of the occurrence of the personal injury or death that is the subject of the action. Authorizes the employer of a master or member of the crew of a vessel, at the employer's election, to participate in an authorized compensation plan under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.\n\nSubjects all vessels operating in the U.S. coastwise trade to minimum international labor and environmental standards. Sets requirements for non-citizens irregularly engaging in the U.S. domestic coastwise trade."
