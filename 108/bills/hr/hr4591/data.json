Requires disclosure of such materials to comport with the Classified Information Procedures Act.\n\nRequires Federal agencies to report data-mining activities to Congress.\n\nProhibits orders requiring the production of certain business records in the course of foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigations absent a finding that specific and articulable facts support the belief that the person to whom the records pertain is a foreign power."
