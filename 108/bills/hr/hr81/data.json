Requires an equitable distribution of grant funds, including Native American communities. Outlines program priorities. Requires non-Federal matching funds of $2 for every $3 of Federal funding. Limits grant duration to five years. Requires the Secretary to ensure that entities receiving funds carry out a project evaluation which includes the effectiveness of program strategies in strengthening families with young children. Requires local educational agencies receiving such grants to ensure that schools receiving such funds maintain a certain ratio of students per counselor, nurse, psychologist, and social worker.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2006."
