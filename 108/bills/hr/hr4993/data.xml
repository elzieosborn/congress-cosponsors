Authorizes the award of attorney's fees and costs in actions in which a party's liability or such damages are contested.

Requires the court, in actions in which liability or noneconomic or punitive damages described in this Act are contested, to instruct the jury that it must take into account the effect of the amount to be awarded in damages on the price and availability of health care liability insurance.</summary>
