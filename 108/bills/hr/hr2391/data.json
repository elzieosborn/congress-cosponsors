    "text": "Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2004 - Title I: Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement - Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) Act of 2004 - (Sec. 102) Amends Federal patent law to provide that patentability is not precluded on the basis of obviousness where subject matter which qualifies as prior art is developed by a person different from the person claiming the invention if: (1) the claimed invention was made by or on behalf of parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the date the claimed invention was made; (2) the claimed invention was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of the agreement; and (3) the application for patent for the claimed invention discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to the agreement. Defines \"joint research agreement\" to mean a written contract, grant, or cooperative agreement entered into by two or more persons or entities for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work in the field of the claimed invention.\n\nTitle II: Piracy Deterrence and Education - Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2004 - (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Attorney General (AG) to establish an 18-month program under which the Department of Justice (DOJ) would send warning letters to the Internet service providers of subscribers who appear to be engaging in copyright infringing conduct. Allows providers to forward the warning letters to such subscribers. Prohibits providers from disclosing any identifying information about such subscribers to DOJ except pursuant to court order or other applicable legal process that requires such disclosure.\n\n(Sec. 204) Directs the AG to ensure that any DOJ unit responsible for investigating computer hacking or investigating intellectual property crimes is assigned at least one agent trained in the investigation and enforcement of such crimes.\n\n(Sec. 205) Establishes an Internet Use Education Program within the Office of the Associate Attorney General of the United States to educate the public concerning: (1) the value of copyrighted works and the effects of their theft on their creators; and (2) the privacy, security, and other risks of using the Internet to obtain illegal copies of copyrighted works. Prohibits the use of DOJ funds allocated for criminal investigations or prosecutions or for the Civil Rights Division for such program.\n\n(Sec. 206) Authorizes the U.S. Government to bring actions for infringement of copyright before registration of the copyright claim.\n\n(Sec. 207) Authorizes appropriations for investigation and prosecution of copyright infringement.\n\n(Sec. 208) Prohibits the unauthorized, knowing use or attempted use of a video camera or similar device to transmit or make a copy of a motion picture or other copyrighted audiovisual work from a performance of such work in a movie theater. Sets forth penalties for such violations, which may include imprisonment for not more than three years for a first offense. Considers the possession of a recording device in a movie theater as evidence in any proceeding to determine whether that person committed such an offense, but shall not, by itself, be sufficient to support a conviction for such offense.\n\nRequires the court to order the forfeiture and destruction or other disposition of all unauthorized copies of motion pictures or other copyrighted audiovisual works and any video camera or other equipment used in connection with the offense in addition to any other penalty.\n\nAuthorizes, with reasonable cause, the owner, lessee, authorized agent, or employee of a movie theater to detain, in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable time, any person suspected of committing such an offense for the purpose of questioning that person or summoning a law enforcement officer.\n\nAllows the victim of such an offense to submit a victim impact statement to the probation officer during the preparation of a presentence report.\n\n(Sec. 209) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) responsible software developers should be commended; (2) the level of ongoing illegal and dangerous activity on publicly accessible peer-to-peer file sharing services is harmful to consumers, minors and the economy; and (3) Congress and the executive branch should consider all appropriate measures to protect consumers and children, and prevent such illegal activity.\n\n(Sec. 210) Revises copyright infringement criminal provisions to prohibit any person who infringes a copyright by the knowing distribution, including by electronic means, with reckless disregard of the risk of further infringement, during any 180-day period, of: (1) 1,000 or more copies or phonorecords of any copyrighted work; (2) any copies or phonorecords of any copyrighted work with a total retail value of more than $10,000; or (3) any copies or phonorecords of any copyrighted prerelease work. Provides that evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work is not, by itself, sufficient to establish the necessary level of intent. Sets forth penalties for such violations.\n\nDirects the Register of Copyrights to issue regulations to establish procedures for preregistration of a work that is being prepared for commercial distribution and has not been published. Requires such regulations to permit preregistration for any work that is in a class of works that the Register determines has had a history of infringement prior to authorized commercial distribution. Requires the applicant to submit, within three months after the work's first publication, an application for registration, a deposit, and the applicable fee.
