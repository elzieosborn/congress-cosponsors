    "text": "Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to designate one or more university-based centers for homeland security. (Currently, the Secretary is required to establish one or more centers within one year after enactment of the Act.) Includes diagnostic medical services and information engineering as criteria for such designation. Authorizes the Secretary to except certain criteria and to consider additional criteria with respect to such designation in order to further homeland security interests.Repeals provisions of the Act which amend the Public Health Service Act to revise definitions of vaccine, vaccine manufacturer, and vaccine-related injury or death.Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Committee on Energy and Commerce should report a bill addressing: (1) revitalizing immunization efforts by ensuring an adequate supply of vaccines and encouraging the development of new vaccines; and (2) ensuring that patients who have suffered vaccine-related injuries have an opportunity for fair redress and that vaccine manufacturers, physicians, and other administrators have adequate protections.Removes the authority of the Secretary to waive a prohibition on contracts with corporate expatriates when the Secretary determines that the waiver will prevent either the loss of jobs in the United States or costs that the Government otherwise would not occur."
