    "text": "Parents' Empowerment Act - Authorizes a minor, through a person acting on the minor's behalf, to obtain relief in a civil action in U.S. district court against anyone who knowingly sells or distributes in interstate or foreign commerce an entertainment product containing material that is harmful to minors if: (1) a reasonable person would expect a substantial number of minors to be exposed to the material; and (2) the minor, as a result of exposure to that material, is likely to suffer personal or emotional injury or injury to mental or moral welfare. Provides for recovery of compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nDeclares it to be an affirmative defense to such action that an act of a parent or guardian who owned the entertainment product was the proximate cause of the minor's exposure to the harmful material.\n\nDefines \"material that is harmful to minors\" as any pornographic communication, picture, image, graphic image file, article, recording, writing, or other pornographic matter of any kind that: (1) is obscene; or (2) violates specified community standards with respect to suitability for minors and lacks sufficient literary, artistic, political, or scientific value to overcome its pernicious effects."
