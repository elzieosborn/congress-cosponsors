Prescribes formulae for tax credits for other employers, including the self-employed, who provide qualified health insurance after such date. Allows a tax credit to certain low-wage workers for 25 percent of amounts paid for coverage under any subsidized health plan maintained by any employer of the taxpayer or of the taxpayer's spouse.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program for payments to qualified nontaxpayer employers who provide qualified health care under this Act.\n\nAmends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, to provide for access to Medicare benefits for individuals 55 to 65 years of age.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a refundable tax credit for employee costs of COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) coverage.\n\nAmends title XXI of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) rename the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) the FamilyCare Program; (2) provide for automatic enrollment of children born to title XXI parents; and (3) allow optional family care coverage of parents of targeted low income children and low-income pregnant women under Medicaid (SSA title XIX).\n\n\n\nRevises the transitional medical assistance (TMA) program, allowing States to extend eligibility for low-income individuals for up to 12 additional months, and eliminating the sunset for TMA.\n\n\n\nIncreases the SCHIP allotment for each of FY 2002 through 2004.\n\nDirects the Secretry to award demonstration grants to up to seven States (or other qualified entities) to conduct innovative programs designed to improve outreach to homeless individuals and families under specified programs, including Medicaid.\n\nLimits cost-sharing under the FamilyCare program to 2.5 percent for families with income below 150 percent of poverty.\n\n\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act to establish the National Center for Evidence-Based Healthcare Practices."
