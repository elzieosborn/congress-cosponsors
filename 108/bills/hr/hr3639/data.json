    "text": "American Workers Assistance Act - Amends the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 (TEUC Act) to extend the TEUC program through weeks of unemployment ending before July 1, 2004. Provides a phase-out period for individual payments up to weeks beginning after December 31, 2004.\n\nIncreases to 26 weeks an eligible individual's TEUC payments. Provides for an additional seven weeks of payments, for a total of 33 weeks, for individuals in high-unemployment States (TEUC-X). (Current law provides 13 weeks of regular TEUC payments, with an additional 13 and total 26 in TEUC-X States.)\n\nRevises requirements for determining TEUC-X States, using certain triggers based on insured unemployment rates and on total unemployment rates."
