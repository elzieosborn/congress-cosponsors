Provides a phase-out period for individual payments up to weeks beginning after December 31, 2004.

Increases to 26 weeks an eligible individual's TEUC payments. Provides for an additional seven weeks of payments, for a total of 33 weeks, for individuals in high-unemployment States (TEUC-X).

Revises requirements for determining TEUC-X States, using certain triggers based on insured unemployment rates and on total unemployment rates.</summary>
