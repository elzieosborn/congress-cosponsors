    "text": "Local Participation in Railroad Operations Act - Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit rail carriers from constructing, developing, or expanding railroad maintenance facilities, intermodal rail transfer facilities, railroad sidings, railroad bridges, railroad yards, or other railroad facilities unless the Surface Transportation Board determines that the carrier has: (1) provided affected local communities with notice and an opportunity to be heard with respect to such activities; and (2) conducted an assessment of negative environmental impacts and appropriate mitigation actions pursuant to State or local law.\n\nProhibits a rail carrier from constructing an at-grade crossing over a public road without first obtaining approval from the local governmental entity with jurisdiction over the location of the proposed grade crossing. Prohibits the Board from approving the consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control of a rail carrier by one or more rail carriers unless it has received assurances that the rail carriers have addressed adequately and will continue to address adequately problems identified with respect to the quality of life and safety of persons who live, work, or are for any other reason near railroad tracks. Repeals a section of the Noise Control Act of 1972 regarding railroad noise emission standards upon the issuance of the final regulations under this Act."
