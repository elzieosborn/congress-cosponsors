    "text": "Veterans Cold Weather Injury Compensation Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish and maintain a registry of veterans who, while in active military service, were exposed for a significant period of time to sustained periods of extremely cold weather (seven days or more of average temperatures of 32 degrees or lower). Requires such registry to be used to determine the association, if any, between the disabilities of such veterans and the exposure to such weather.Presumes cold-weather injuries in such veterans to be service-connected and therefore compensable through veterans' disability compensation.Directs the Secretary, within 90 days, to prescribe initial regulations on injuries determined to have a positive association with sustained exposure to cold weather."
