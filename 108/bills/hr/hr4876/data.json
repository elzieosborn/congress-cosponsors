States that nothing in this Act requires private property owners located within the Region to participate in the Initiative.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to reauthorize appropriations for the Office of Management Conference of the Long Island Sound Study and implementation of the Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan through FY 2009."
