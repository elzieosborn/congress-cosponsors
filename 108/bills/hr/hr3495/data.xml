  <summary date="2004-04-16T14:45:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to change the eligibility standard for assistance under the emergency preparedness demonstration program established by such Act from "minority communities" to "disadvantaged communities."

Defines "disadvantaged communities" as a communities predominantly populated by socially or economically disadvantaged individuals who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities, and whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities.</summary>
