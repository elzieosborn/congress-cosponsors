  <summary date="2004-04-15T19:35:05Z" status="Introduced in House">State Veterans Home Nurse Recruitment Act of 2004 - Amends Federal veterans' benefits provisions to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make payments to States for assisting State veterans' homes in the hiring and retention of nurses and the reduction of nursing shortages at such homes. Makes eligible for such assistance State homes that: (1) currently receive per diem payments from the Secretary for the care of veterans; and (2) have in effect an employee incentive scholarship or other program designed to promote the hiring and retention of nursing staff and reduce nursing shortages. Limits such assistance to no more than 50 percent of the fiscal year costs of such a program.

Requires the assistance program to be implemented as expeditiously as possible, so that payments are made to eligible States commencing no later than January 1, 2005.</summary>
