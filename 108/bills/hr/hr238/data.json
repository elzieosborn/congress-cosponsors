    "text": "Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application Act of 2003 - Sets forth a funding program for the Secretary of Energy ( Secretary) to implement the programs outlined below, including energy efficiency and conservation research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities that target: (1) lighting systems; (2) buildings; (3) vehicles; (4) an energy efficiency science initiative; (5) distributed energy and electric energy systems; (6) hybrid distributed power systems; (7) electrical transmission systems; (8) renewable energy; and (9) bioenergy.George E. Brown, Jr. and Robert S. Walker Hydrogen Future Act of 2003 - Amends the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to instruct the Secretary to conduct a research and development program regarding production, storage, transportation, and use of hydrogen as an energy source in order to enable the private sector to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using hydrogen for industrial, commercial, residential, transportation, and utility applications.Amends the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996 to prescribe guidelines under which the Secretary shall solicit proposals for projects demonstrating hydrogen technologies needed to use fuel cells in Federal, State, and local government stationary and transportation applications.Instructs the Secretary to: (1) implement nuclear energy research programs through a Nuclear Energy Research Initiative; (2) conduct an advanced fuel recycling technology research and development program; (3) establish a university nuclear science and engineering support program; (4) conduct fossil energy research programs; (5) implement a program targeting ultra-deepwater and unconventional natural gas and other petroleum resource exploration and production; (6) implement a fusion energy sciences experimental program for fusion plasmas; (7) maintain facility and infrastructure support for nonmilitary energy laboratories; and (8) establish a program of United States-Mexico energy technology cooperation.Authorizes the Secretary to provide loan guarantees to private firms for: (1) coal gasification; and (2) petroleum coke gasification polygeneration. Authorizes appropriations for a loan to the owner of a specified experimental plant on such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, including interest rates and upfront payments.Mandates establishment of a Technology Infrastructure Program to improve the ability of National Laboratories and single-purpose research facilities to support Department of Energy missions.Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to replace the position of Director of the Office of Science with the position of Assistant Secretary of Science responsible for fundamental science and engineering research functions of the Department, and for research policy and management.Instructs the Secretary to establish a pilot grant program for: (1) the demonstration and commercial application of alternative fuel school buses and ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses; and (2) acquisition by governmental entities and metropolitan transportation authorities of alternative fueled and advanced vehicles.Prescribes project criteria under which the Secretary is authorized to fund a Clean Coal Power Initiative that targets primarily coal-based gasification technologies and Clean Coal Centers of Excellence."
