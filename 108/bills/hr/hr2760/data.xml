  <summary date="2004-10-26T15:32:09Z" status="Passed House amended">Resolution of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Border Dispute Act of 2004 - (Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that both Ethiopia and Eritrea should: (1) take all appropriate actions to implement the Algiers Agreements, including by accepting the "Delimitation Decision" issued by the neutral Boundary Commission on April 13, 2002, with respect to the boundary between the two countries; and (2) fully cooperate with the United Nations (UN) Special Envoy for Ethiopia-Eritrea.

(Sec. 5) Declares that: (1) Congress expresses its support for the Boundary Commission established by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and calls on the international community to continue to support the UN trust fund to facilitate the demarcation process between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the economic and social transition of affected communities to new borders; (2) it shall be U.S. policy to limit U.S. assistance for Ethiopia or Eritrea if either country is not in compliance with, or is not taking significant steps to comply with the Algiers Agreements; and (3) Congress strongly condemns statements by senior Ethiopian officials criticizing the Boundary Commission's decision and calls on the Government of Ethiopia to accept the Commission's decision.

(Sec. 6) States that economic and military assistance for Ethiopia or Eritrea may only be provided for any period of time for which the President determines that either Ethiopia or Eritrea is in compliance with, or is taking significant steps to comply with, the Algiers Agreements. Authorizes presidential waiver of such provision for national security purposes. Exempts from such provision assistance for humanitarian or human rights purposes, or for HIV/AIDS control.

(Sec. 7) Directs the President to establish, after finalization of the Ethiopian-Eritrean border demarcation, an integration and border development initiative, including projects to: (1) increase basic services; (2) develop free trade and community development; and (3) reinforce peace and reconciliation.

(Sec. 8) Sets forth presidential reporting requirements.</summary>
