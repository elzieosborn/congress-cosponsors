Requires the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) establish a Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities Program at the Department of Commerce; (2) provide for a coordinated Federal response to economic dislocation in communities negatively impacted by trade; and (3) make a determination if a community is negatively impacted by a trade and certify such community for assistance.\n\nAllows communities negatively impacted by trade to develop strategic plans for community economic adjustment and diversification. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to communities that devise such strategic plans and to give preference to rural communities.\n\nDirects the Secretary to certify certain communities that were negatively impacted by trade on or after January 1, 1998, for adjustment assistance."
