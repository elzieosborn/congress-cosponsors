    "text": "National Monument Fairness Act - Revises Federal law with respect to a presidential proclamation that, during one calendar year, either creates a national monument that is more than 50,000 acres or that adds more than 50,000 acres to an existing national monument. Prohibits the issuance of such a proclamation until 30 days after the President has transmitted the proposed proclamation to the Governor of the State or States in which such acreage is located, soliciting written comment. Makes any such proclamation ineffective two years after its issuance unless Congress has approved it by law. Provides that land subject to a proclamation issued after the enactment of this Act that ceases to be effective shall revert to the land use status it had before the proclamation was issued.\n\nRequires the President: (1) to solicit public participation and comment in the development of a monument proclamation; (2) to consult with the Governor and entire congressional delegation of the State or territory in which such lands are located at least 60 days before any national monument proclamation; and (3) before issuing it, to consider any information, including public comments, made available in the development of existing plans and programs for the management of the lands under consideration.\n\nRequires any management plan for a national monument developed subsequent to a proclamation made under this Act to comply with the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
