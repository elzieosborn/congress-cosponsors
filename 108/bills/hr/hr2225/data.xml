  <summary date="2003-08-29T18:57:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Authorizes the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for: (1) LEA purchase or lease of qualified vending machines to place in schools for student use; and (2) offsetting of any loss of LEA revenue resulting from using qualified vending machines which offer only healthy foods and beverages for sale.

Requires an LEA, as a condition for receiving such a grant, to agree to: (1) remove any vending machines that sell foods and beverages of minimal nutritional value from each elementary or secondary school where qualified vending machines will be placed using the grant funds; and (2) use only qualified vending machines in such school for a period prescribed by the Director.

Limits maximum portion sizes of food and beverages offered for sale in qualified vending machines.</summary>
