(Sec. 5) Authorizes the Commission to grant a continuance of up to 14 days beyond the current allowed recess of five days for the counsel of persons alleged to be mentally ill to prepare a case. Requires extension of the emergency observation and detention period for the subject of the hearing for the duration of the continuance.
