    "text": "Mutual Funds Integrity and Fee Transparency Act of 2003 - Title I: Integrity and Fee Transparency - (Sec.101) Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require an open-end management investment company (mutual fund) to disclose costs in its periodic reports to shareholders, including: (1) the estimated amount, in dollars for each $1,000 of investment in the company, of the operating expenses of the company that are borne by shareholders; (2) the structure of, or the method used to determine, the compensation of individuals employed by the investment adviser to manage the company portfolio, and their ownership interest in the securities of the company; (3) the portfolio turnover rate of the company, so as to facilitate comparison among investment companies, and a description of the implications of a high turnover rate for portfolio transaction costs and performance; (4) information concerning the company's policies and practices regarding payment of commissions for effecting securities transactions to a member of an exchange, broker, or dealer who furnishes investment advice, including analyses and reports, and facilitates sale and distribution of the company's shares; (5) information concerning payments by any person other than the company that are intended to facilitate the sale and distribution of the company's shares; and (6) information concerning discounts on front-end sales loads for which investors may be eligible, including the minimum purchase amounts required for such discounts.\n\nStates that a disclosure made exclusively in a prospectus or statement of additional information shall not be deemed to be made in an appropriate disclosure document, unless it is a disclosure required under (2) or (4) above.\n\nRequires the SEC to report to certain congressional committees on a \"concept release\" examining portfolio transaction costs incurred by investment companies, including commission, spread, opportunity, and market impact costs, with respect to trading portfolio securities, and how such costs may be disclosed in a manner that enables mutual fund investors to compare costs among funds.\n\nInstructs the SEC to promulgate a rule requiring an open-end management investment company to inform shareholders in its quarterly statement or other periodic report that fees paid on their investments have been deducted from the amounts shown on the statements, and where they may find additional information regarding fee amounts.\n\n(Sec. 102) Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to require each investment adviser to a registered investment company to report at least annually to such company's board of directors regarding: (1) revenue sharing arrangements (payments by the adviser (or an affiliated person) that were directly or indirectly made for the purpose of promoting the sale of the investment company's shares); (2) directed brokerage arrangements (services to the company provided or paid for by a broker or dealer (or an affiliated person) (other than brokerage and research services) in exchange for the direction of brokerage to the broker or dealer); and (3) soft dollar arrangements (research services obtained by the adviser (or an affiliated person) from a broker or dealer the receipt of which may reasonably be attributed to securities transactions effected on behalf of the company or any other company that is a member of the same group of investment companies).\n\nRequires inclusion of such reports in the annual report to shareholders.\n\nImposes a fiduciary duty upon the board of directors of a registered investment company to: (1) review the investment adviser's direction of the company's brokerage transactions, and determine that such direction serves the best interests of company shareholders; and (2) review any revenue sharing arrangements to ensure compliance with such Act, and determine that such arrangements serve the best interests of company shareholders.\n\nDirects the SEC by rule to require that: (1) if any research services are provided by a member of an exchange, broker, or dealer who effects securities transactions in an account, and are prepared or provided by a party unaffiliated with such member, broker, or dealer, any person exercising investment discretion with respect to such account shall maintain a copy of the written contract between the person preparing such research and the member of an exchange, broker, or dealer; and (2) such contract shall describe the nature and value of the services provided.\n\n (Sec. 103) Reduces from 60 percent to one-third the number of \"interested persons\" who may serve as board members of a registered company.\n\nRedefines \"interested person\" as any natural person who is a member of a class of persons who the Commission, by rule or regulation, determines are unlikely to exercise an appropriate degree of independence as a result of: (1) a material business or professional relationship with the company or any affiliated person of the company;
