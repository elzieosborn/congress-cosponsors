    "text": "Consumer Protection for On-Line Games Act - Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prescribe rules to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the labeling and advertising of games of chance and games of skill offered by means of the communications networks by network game operators. Requires that such rules prohibit: (1) making false, unsubstantiated, non-verifiable, or misleading claims regarding the fairness of the game; (2) displaying or advertising any seal or insignia attesting to the fairness of any game of chance or skill unless such seal or insignia has been awarded by a self-regulatory organization that complies with this Act; and (3) unfair or deceptive acts or practices that evade such rules or undermine customer rights.Requires a self-regulatory organization, to be in compliance, to: (1) be able to enforce compliance by its members; and (2) have rules designed to prevent fraudulent and deceptive acts and practices, to protect consumers and the public interest, and to discipline violating members.Authorizes State attorneys general to bring civil actions on behalf of residents in U.S. district court to enjoin a pattern or practice which violates such FTC rules."
