  <summary date="2004-09-15T18:29:52Z" status="Introduced in House">Requires the President to take such actions as are necessary, in accordance with specified laws and treaties, to ensure the videotaping of interrogations and other intelligence-related interactions between detainees or prisoners under the effective control of the U.S. Armed Forces, and members of the U.S. Armed Forces, U.S. intelligence operatives, or contractors of the United States. Directs the President to provide for the appropriate classification of such videotapes. Requires such videotapes to be made available, under seal if appropriate, to both the prosecution and defense if material to any military or civilian criminal proceeding.

Requires the President to take necessary actions to ensure immediate and unfettered access to detainees or prisoners in the custody or effective control of the U.S. Armed Forces by the following organizations: (1) International Federation of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent; (2) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and (3) United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture.

Directs the Judge Advocate General to develop guidelines to ensure that the videotaping required by this Act is sufficiently expansive to prevent any abuse of detainees and prisoners and violations of specified laws and treaties.</summary>
