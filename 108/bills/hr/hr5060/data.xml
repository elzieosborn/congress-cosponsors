  <summary date="2004-10-06T15:52:22Z" status="Introduced in House">College Student Credit Card Protection Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to limit by a specified formula the total credit extended under a credit card account to a full time, traditional-aged college student (unless the student's parent or guardian assumes joint liability).

 Prohibits increasing the credit limit on an account for which a parent or guardian has assumed joint liability without the parent's or guardian's approval.

Prohibits a creditor from opening a credit card account for any such college student who: (1) has no annual gross income; and (2) already has a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan.</summary>
