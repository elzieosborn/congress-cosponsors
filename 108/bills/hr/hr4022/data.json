Requires an employer to ensure that information received under this Act is maintained confidentially, not misused, and destroyed within a specified time. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security properly uses the results.\n\nSets penalties for knowingly and intentionally using any information obtained pursuant to this Act for a purpose other than that of determining suitability for employment."
