    "text": "Local Voices on TV Act of 2003 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a cable television operator (operator) from carrying the signal of a qualified class A television station (a station that provides local and specialized service and meets certain other requirements) in lieu of a full power analog or digital local commercial station. Requires that, if there are not sufficient signals of full power local commercial stations to fill the channels set aside for local programming, an operator with a system capacity of 35 or fewer channels must carry one qualified low power station (current law) or one qualified class A station. Requires: (1) an operator with a system capacity of more than 35 but less than 72 channels to carry two stations that are either class A or low power stations; and (2) an operator with a system capacity of more than 72 channels to carry three that are either type of stations. Grants carriage rights to all qualified class A stations in a designated market area if there are three or fewer commercial full power stations serving that area that do not substantially retransmit the signal of another broadcast station.Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe regulations to implement provisions for the application and granting of new class A television licenses in accordance with the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999. Directs the FCC to consider whether the treatment of a low-power station as a class A station would meet the public interest, convenience, and necessity.Requires prompt FCC review and determination with respect to applications of advanced television services."
