Prohibits the Supreme Court and the Federal courts from issuing any ruling that appropriates or expends money, imposes taxes, or otherwise interferes with the legislative functions or administrative discretion of the States.\n\nAuthorizes any party or intervener in matters before any Federal court, including the Supreme Court, to challenge the jurisdiction of the court under this Act.\n\nProvides that the violation of this Act by any justice or judge is an impeachable offense and a material breach of good behavior subject to removal.\n\nNegates as binding precedent on the State courts any Federal court decision that relates to an issue removed from Federal jurisdiction by this Act."
