Requires all documents to presented in English.

Prohibits Federal agencies from accepting for any identification-related purpose any State-issued driver's license or other comparable identification document unless the State requires such licenses or documents issued to nonimmigrant aliens to expire on a date that is not later than: (1) the expiration of the alien's authorized U.S. stay; or (2) five years after such document's issuance in any case in which the alien's lawful stay is modified after U.S. admission, or does not expire on a fixed date.
