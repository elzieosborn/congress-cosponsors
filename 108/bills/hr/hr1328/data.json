Provides a basic pay reduction for entitlement to such assistance.Provides an opportunity for certain active-duty military personnel who first became a member of the armed forces before July 1, 1985, to enroll for such assistance during an open period under eligibility requirements very similar to those above, and requires a similar basic pay reduction for such assistance."
