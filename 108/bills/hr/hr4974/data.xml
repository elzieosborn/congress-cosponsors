  <summary date="2004-10-25T15:10:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Post 9/11 Health Protection Act of 2004 - Establishes in the Treasury the September 11 Emergency Personnel Trust Fund. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase by one percent the tax imposed on adjusted gross income that exceeds $1,000,000 for married individuals filing jointly or that exceeds $500,000 in any other case. Appropriates amounts equal to the taxes received because of such increase to the Fund.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to award from such Fund grants or cooperative agreements to specified programs, including one established by the New York City Fire Department, to carry out screening and clinical examinations and long-term health monitoring for covered individuals, including emergency service personnel, clean up workers, and residents affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York City. Limits such monitoring to 20 years and 40,000 individuals. Allows the Secretary to establish a similar program for those affected by the September 11, 2001, Pentagon attack.

Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to conduct or support diagnostic or treatment research for certain adverse health conditions considered to be associated with the terrorist attacks.</summary>
