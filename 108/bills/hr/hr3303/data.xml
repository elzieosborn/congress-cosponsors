  <summary date="2003-12-09T22:28:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Rocky Flats Minerals Acquisition Act - Amends Federal law to permit the Secretary of the Interior to acquire mineral interests, including interests in sand and gravel, within Rocky Flats, Colorado, by purchase, exchange, issuance of credits, or any combination. Defines credits as legal instruments or other written documentation, or an entry in an account managed by the Secretary, that can be used in lieu of any other monetary payment for: (1) bonus bids for lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf; or (2) royalty due on any oil or gas production under any lease of an area located in a specified part of the Outer Continental Shelf.

Declares that the requirement under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 that lands or interests exchanged must be located in the same State shall not apply to land or an interest in land in Rocky Flats that is acquired by the United States in an exchange.

States that any interests acquired by the United States under this Act shall be managed by the Secretary under the standards that apply to the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. Declares that no minerals acquired under this Act shall be subject to development or disposal by the United States or any other party under any law related to minerals owned by the United States.</summary>
