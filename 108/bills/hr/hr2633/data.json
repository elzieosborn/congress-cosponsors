Amends Federal criminal law to: (1) restrict the display, sale, or purchase of social security numbers without the individual's affirmative, express consent; and (2) authorize the Federal court to order the violator of such restrictions to pay restitution to the Social Security Administration, which shall be considered the victim.\n\nDeems refusal to do business without receipt of social security account number to be an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n\nAmends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to: (1) mandate confidential treatment by a consumer reporting agency with respect to the social security account number of a consumer; (2) prohibit such agency from furnishing reports containing medical information for employment purposes, or in connection with a credit or insurance transaction unless the consumer specifically grants written consent on a separate document that describes in clear and concise language the use for which the information will be furnished; and (3) proscribe the procurement or use of medical information in connection with any offer to provide any financial product or service, other than insurance."
