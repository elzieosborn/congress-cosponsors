    "text": "Lead-Free Drinking Water Act of 2004 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to revise the national primary drinking water regulation for lead to provide adequate protection for individuals affected by lead contamination, particularly vulnerable populations.\n\nRequires the revised regulation to establish a maximum contaminant level or a drinking water treatment technique that meets specified criteria.\n\nDirects community water systems or nontransient noncommunity water systems to: (1) annually replace a percentage of non-lead free service lines until all such lines are replaced; (2) provide notice to individuals and entities that may be exposed to lead contamination; (3) provide water lead test results to tested residences; (4) establish a public education program on lead in drinking water; and (5) provide water filters to each residence, school, and day care facility in the service area that reasonably could experience lead contamination.\n\nRequires the General Services Administration to conduct water supply testing in Federal buildings and to take related action.\n\nDirects each water system to test drinking water for lead contamination within one year.\n\nRequires the Administrator to revise monitoring requirements under the national primary drinking water regulation to incorporate specified criteria.\n\nRedefines \"lead free\" to reduce acceptable lead levels in specified drinking water hardware. Requires new plumbing parts and components to be lead free by January 1, 2005.\n\nRequires the Administrator to establish a grant program to address lead contamination in school drinking water."
