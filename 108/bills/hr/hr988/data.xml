States that such assistance shall not be construed as a waiver of rights under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Authorizes such payments to be made from the Department of Agriculture's and the Department of the Interior's Wildfire Management Accounts.States that any action or decision taken respecting a prescribed fire shall not be considered to be the exercise of a discretionary function.Allows an individual with a claim before a Federal agency to amend it before final action is taken on it by the agency, or before the individual brings a civil action under FTCA against the United States, whichever may be later.Requires an agency to: (1) notify an individual whose claim fails to state a claim upon which the agency may take action under FTCA; and (2) attach to any claim form it distributes notice that the claim may be amended.</summary>
