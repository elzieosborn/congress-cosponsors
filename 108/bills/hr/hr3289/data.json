    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since the conference report was filed in the House on October 30, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 - Makes emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2004 for military and foreign affairs operations concerning Iraq and Afghanistan, including for Iraqi relief and reconstruction.\n\nTitle I: National Security - Chapter 1: Department of Defense-Military - Makes appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for: (1) military personnel; (2) operation and maintenance (O&M); (3) overseas humanitarian, disaster, and civic aid; (4) the Iraq Freedom Fund; (5) procurement; (6) research, development, test and evaluation; (7) Defense Working Capital Funds and the National Defense Sealift Fund; (8) the Defense Health Program; (9) drug interdiction and counter-drug activities related to Afghanistan; and (10) the Intelligence Community Management Account.\n\n(Sec. 1104) Continues during FY 2004 the increased monthly rates of pay, currently authorized for FY 2003, for imminent danger special pay and the family separation allowance.\n\n(Sec. 1106) Allows DOD O&M funds to be used to: (1) provide logistical support to coalition forces supporting military and stability operations in Iraq; and (2) enhance the capability of the New Iraqi Army and the Afghan National Army to combat terrorism and support U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n(Sec. 1109) Appropriates funds to DOD to be used only for recovery and repair of damage due to natural disasters, including Hurricane Isabel.\n\n(Sec. 1110) Earmarks specified O&M funds for the Commander's Emergency Response Program (urgent Iraqi humanitarian and reconstruction relief and assistance for the people of Afghanistan). Requires quarterly reports from the Secretary of Defense to the congressional defense committees regarding the use of such funds.\n\n(Sec. 1111) Requires a report from the Secretary to the defense committees describing an Analysis of Alternatives for replacing the capabilities of the existing Air Force fleet of KC-135 tanker aircraft.\n\n(Sec. 1112) Makes permanent (currently, applies only during FY 2004) the exemption from the requirement of payment of subsistence charges while hospitalized in a military facility for an enlisted member, former enlisted member, officer, or former officer who is hospitalized in a military facility because of an injury incurred: (1) as a direct result of armed conflict; (2) while engaged in hazardous service; (3) in the performance of duty under conditions simulating war; or (4) through an instrumentality of war. Amends the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004 to make such exemption retroactive with respect to any period of hospitalization on or after September 11, 2001. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to refund any amount paid, or waive recovery of unpaid amounts, for such charges since that date.\n\n(Sec. 1114) Allows the administering Secretaries to provide to members of the Ready Reserve called to active duty any medical and dental screening and care necessary to meet applicable standards for deployment. Requires the Secretary concerned to notify such members of their eligibility for such screening and care. Terminates such authority on September 30, 2004.\n\n(Sec. 1115) Makes each member of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve who is placed in a mobilization category (subject to being ordered to active duty involuntarily) eligible to enroll in TRICARE for self or family coverage and to receive benefits for any period that such member: (1) is an eligible unemployment compensation recipient; or (2) is not eligible for health-care benefits under an employer-sponsored health benefits plan. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for at least one open enrollment period each year; and (2) charge appropriate premiums for such coverage. Prohibits a member from enrolling in the TRICARE program while entitled to DOD transitional health care.\n\n(Sec. 1116) Sets forth conditions under which a member of the reserves who is issued a delayed-effective-date active duty order shall be treated as being on active duty for more than 30 days and therefore eligible for medical and dental care for active-duty personnel.
