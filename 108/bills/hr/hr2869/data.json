Directs the Secretary to accept from the Claimant a conveyance of any of certain specified private lands in northern Nevada, with the Claimant to receive a credit equal to the market value of each such transferred property.\n\nSubjects all lands conveyed under this Act to valid existing rights.\n\nDirects that the proceeds from the sales of the lands be used: (1) to support the State's general education program; (2) to support a trust fund for the California Trail Interpretative Center in Elko County; (3) for the rehabilitation of lands in Nevada that were subject to historic mining activities; and (4) for the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Nevada State Office and relevant Field Offices of the Bureau of Land Management in conducting the sales."
