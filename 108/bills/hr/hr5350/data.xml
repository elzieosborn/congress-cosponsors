Requires grantees to: (1) develop innovative curricula; (2) integrate such curricula into the medical education at the school; (3) evaluate the results achieved with the curricula; (4) establish a multidisciplinary planning committee to develop the curricula; and (5) report to the Secretary on the developed curricula and results achieved.
