  <summary date="2004-07-26T18:45:52Z" status="Passed House amended">Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2004 - Title I: Conditions on Increased Nonhumanitarian Assistance to the Government of Vietnam - (Sec. 101) Prohibits FY 2005 U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to the Government of Vietnam in excess of FY 2004 levels unless the President certifies to Congress that the Government of Vietnam: (1) has made substantial progress toward releasing all political and religious prisoners from imprisonment and other forms of detention; (2) has made substantial progress toward respecting the right to freedom of religion, and has made substantial progress toward returning estates and properties confiscated from the churches; (3) has made substantial progress toward allowing Vietnamese nationals access to U.S. refugee programs; and (4) has made substantial progress toward respecting the human rights of members of ethnic minority groups in the Central Highlands and elsewhere in Vietnam.

Prohibits U.S. post-FY 2005 nonhumanitarian assistance to the Government of Vietnam in excess of FY 2004 levels unless the President certifies to Congress that the Government of Vietnam: (1) has made substantial progress toward releasing all political and religious prisoners from imprisonment and other forms of detention; (2) has made substantial progress toward respecting the right to freedom of religion, and has made substantial progress toward returning estates and properties confiscated from the churches; (3) has made substantial progress toward allowing Vietnamese nationals access to U.S. refugee programs; (4) has made substantial progress toward respecting the human rights of members of ethnic minority groups in the Central Highlands and elsewhere in Vietnam; and (5) neither any official of the Government of Vietnam nor any of its agencies was complicit in a severe form of trafficking in persons, or the Government of Vietnam took all appropriate steps to end any such complicity and hold any such official, agency, or entity fully accountable for its conduct.

 Authorizes the President to waive such requirements if increased U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance would promote the purposes of this Act or is otherwise in the U.S. national interest.

Title II: Assistance to Support Human Rights and Democracy in Vietnam - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the President to provide U.S. assistance, through appropriate nongovernmental organizations, for the support of individuals and organizations to promote human rights and nonviolent democratic change in Vietnam. Authorizes FY 2005 and 2006 appropriations. Title III: United States Public Diplomacy - (Sec. 301) Declares it is U.S. policy: (1) to take necessary measures to overcome the jamming of Radio Free Asia by the Government of Vietnam; and (2) that educational and cultural exchange programs with Vietnam should promote progress toward freedom and democracy. Title IV: Annual Report on Progress Toward Freedom and Democracy in Vietnam - (Sec. 401) Directs the Secretary of State to report annually to Congress on: (1) whether requirements in the President's certification have been met, or on the President's waiver of such requirements; (2) U.S. efforts to secure transmission sites for Radio Free Asia in countries close to Vietnam; (3) efforts to ensure that educational and cultural exchange programs with Vietnam promote certain participation policies; (4) U.S. steps to offer refugee resettlement to certain Vietnamese nationals; (5) actions of the Government of Vietnam reflecting compliance with or violation of human rights; (6) lists of persons believed to be persecuted by the Government of Vietnam for their pursuit of human rights; and (7) the development of the rule of law in Vietnam.</summary>
