  <summary date="2006-10-26T14:36:56Z" status="Reported to House without amendment, Part I">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

2004 District of Columbia Omnibus Authorization Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to require the Board of Education, by March 1 of each year or the date on which the Mayor of the District of Columbia makes the proposed annual budget for a year available (whichever occurs later), to submit to the District Council a plan for the allocation of the Mayor's proposed budget among various object classes and responsibility centers. Specifies the content of such plan.

(Sec. 3) Amends the District of Columbia Code to authorize the District's Executive Officer, under certain conditions, to enter into: (1) a contract for procurement of severable services in the same manner and to the same extent as the head of an executive agency may enter into such a contract under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949; (2) a lease agreement for the accommodation of the District of Columbia courts in a building which is in existence or being erected by the lessor to accommodate them; and (3) a multiyear contract for the acquisition of property or services in the same manner and to the same extent as an executive agency may enter into such a contract under the Act.

Provides for cancellation or termination of a multiyear contract for services in the event that funds are not made available for its continuation into a subsequent fiscal year.

(Sec. 4) Requires: (1) the fiscal year for the Armory Board to begin on January 1 and end on December 31 of each calendar year; and (2) the fiscal year for the DC Public Schools (including public charter schools) and the University of the District of Columbia, starting FY 2007, to begin on July 1 and to end on June 30 of each calendar year.

(Sec. 5) Extends from 50 to 56 calendar days the deadline by which the Council, after receipt of the budget proposal from the Mayor, and after public hearing, shall by act adopt the annual budget for the District government.

(Sec. 6) Makes overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act inapplicable to the hours of a District government employee which constitute a compressed schedule.

(Sec. 7) Amends the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 to subject a Legal Service Attorney, other than a Senior Executive Attorney, to additional disciplinary action such as placing of the attorney on enforced annual leave or enforced leave without pay for unacceptable performance or for any reason that is not arbitrary or capricious.

(Sec. 8) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, National Housing Act, Bank Holding Company Act, Bank Protection Act of 1968, Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Federal Reserve Act, and the National Bank Receivership Act to provide for regulation of District of Columbia-chartered banks by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in lieu of the Office of the Comptroller.</summary>
