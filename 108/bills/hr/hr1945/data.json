    "text": "Pacific Salmon Recovery Act - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide financial assistance for salmon conservation and habitat restoration activities to qualified States and tribal governments.Requires qualified States to: (1) submit a Salmon Conservation and Salmon Habitat Restoration Plan to the Secretary; (2) use allocated funds for local and regional projects; (3) match, in the aggregate, financial assistance provided; and (4) establish citizens advisory committees or other similar fora for public participation.Permits the use of assistance outside the jurisdiction of the recipient if the assisted activity will provide conservation benefits to naturally produced salmon in streams of concern to the recipient.Treats Lahontan cutthroat trout and bull trout as salmon in Oregon, and bull trout as salmon in Washington and Idaho, for purposes of this Act.Directs the President, for U.S. citizens who served as employees of the International Pacific Salmon and North Pacific Fisheries Commissions and who worked in Canada during the course of such employment, to calculate and report to Congress the difference in amount between the valuation of the Commissions' annuity for each employee's payment in U.S. and in Canadian currency for past and future annuity payments.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) any equipment or products authorized for purchase with financial assistance under this Act, should only be U.S. equipment or products; and (2) the Congress supports the bipartisan July 2000 goals, objectives, and recommendations of the Governors of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington.Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress regarding the effects on Pacific Salmon stocks of timber harvesting on publicly owned lands in British Columbia."
