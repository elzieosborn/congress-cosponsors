  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported in the House on February 13, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to make grants to States for the purposes of: (1) coordinating mosquito control programs; and (2) assisting States to localities to conduct assessments regarding the need for control programs and to develop plans for carrying out such programs. Directs the Secretary to give preference to States that have one or more localities with high incidences of mosquito-borne disease or substantial populations of infected mosquitoes.Requires States receiving grants to: (1) have developed, or to have agreed to develop, a plan for coordinating control programs in the State which takes into account any assessments or plans for control programs that have been conducted or developed in the State; (2) agree to monitor control programs in the State to ensure they are carried out in accordance with such plan; and (3) submit a report to the Secretary describing the activities of the State under the grant and evaluating whether the control programs of localities were effectively coordinated with each other.Allows the Secretary, acting through the Director, to make grants for control programs to localities that have: (1) conducted an assessment of the needs for a program, with such assessment including an entomological survey of potential mosquito breeding areas; and (2) developed, based on the assessment, a plan for carrying out a control program. Requires each locality receiving a grant for a control program to make available matching funds in an amount not less than 1/3 of the cost of the program. Allows the Secretary to waive the matching requirement in the case of extraordinary economic conditions in a locality. Requires a locality receiving a grant to submit a report to the Secretary and to the State in which the locality is located describing the control program and its effectiveness.Permits the Secretary to provide training and technical assistance to localities with respect to the planning, development, and operation of control programs and assessments and plans, either directly or through award of grants or contracts to public and private entities.Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 3) Requires the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to conduct or support research into methods to control the population of insects and vermin that transmit dangerous diseases to humans.</summary>
