    "text": "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (2) Department of Defense; (3) Defense Intelligence Agency; (4) National Security Agency (NSA); (5) National Reconnaissance Office; (6) National Imagery and Mapping Agency; (7) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (8) Departments of State, the Treasury, Energy, and Justice; (9) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (10) Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and (11) Coast Guard. (Sec. 102) Specifies that the amounts authorized and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 2004, for such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees and the President.(Sec. 103) Allows the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY 2004 (by not more than two percent) when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Requires notification of the congressional intelligence committees.(Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account for FY 2004, for full-time personnel for elements within such Account, and for certain classified personnel. Earmarks a specified amount of such funds for the National Drug Intelligence Center.

Requires consultation with the DCI in the appointment of the Assistant Secretary. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.Title III: General Provisions - Subtitle A: Recurring General Provisions - (Sec. 301) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for Federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law.(Sec. 302) Specifies that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise permitted by the Constitution or laws of the United States.Subtitle B: Intelligence - (Sec. 311) Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 to increase certain thresholds for congressional notification and/or approval for projects to construct or improve intelligence community (IC) facilities. Authorizes the DCI to undertake an emergency construction project seven (currently 21) days after congressional notification. Authorizes the DCI and the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to undertake an emergency project on the same date as congressional notification when they jointly determine that an emergency relating to the national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality exists and that delay would irreparably harm those interests.Subtitle C: Counterintelligence - (Sec. 321) Requires the DCI to establish and implement for all Federal agencies that handle classified information relating to U.S. national security an inspection process intended to assure that those agencies maintain effective operational security practices and programs directed against counterintelligence activities.
