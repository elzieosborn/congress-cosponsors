Provides for the Commission to consist of 15 members, including the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Prohibits: (1) any Commission member from having or having pending a contractual relationship with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and (2) the President from appointing any individual as a Commission member who has a current or former relationship with the Administrator of NASA that the President determines would constitute a conflict of interest.

Instructs the Commission to undertake the following tasks: (1) catalog threats to and vulnerabilities of the ISS, including sabotage or terrorist attack; (2) make recommendations for corrective actions; and (3) provide any additional findings or recommendations considered by the Commission to be important, whether or not they are related to ISS safety.

Sets forth the powers and other authorities of the Commission.

Directs the NASA Engineering and Safety Center to provide data and technical support as requested by the Commission.

Requires the appropriate Federal agencies or departments to cooperate with the Commission in expeditiously providing appropriate security clearances to the Commission members and staff. Prohibits any person from being provided access to classified information under this Act without the appropriate security clearances.

Allows the Commission to submit interim reports containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations for corrective actions to the President and Congress. Terminates the Commission and all the authorities of this Act with respect to the Commission after the Commission's final report containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations for such actions is submitted to the President and Congress and made available to the public.

Directs the NASA Administrator to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences for a review of compliance with the Commission's recommendations and to transmit a report to Congress containing the results of such review.</summary>
