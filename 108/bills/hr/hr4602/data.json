    "text": "Alaska Native Allotment Subdivision Act - Authorizes an Alaskan Native owner of restricted land (land in Alaska subject to Federal restrictions against alienation and taxation), with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, to: (1) subdivide the restricted land in accordance with State laws or applicable local platting authority; and (2) execute a certificate of ownership and dedication regarding such land with the same effect under State law as if the subdivided and dedicated land were held by unrestricted fee simple title.\n\nRatifies and confirms prior subdivisions and dedications as of the date of the Secretary's approval.\n\nProvides that, except in a case in which a specific interest in such restricted land is dedicated, nothing in this Act terminates, diminishes, or otherwise affects the continued existence and applicability of Federal restrictions against alienation and taxation on restricted land or interests in restricted land (including such subdivided restricted land)."
