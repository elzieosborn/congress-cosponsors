  <summary date="2004-08-03T16:33:56Z" status="Introduced in House">Child Support Collection Enforcement Act - Amends the Social Security Act to revise child support enforcement program provisions to require States to: (1) establish procedures to ensure that interest accrues on child support payments which are in arrears; (2) use child support late payment fees to carry out approved State plans for the child support enforcement program; and (3) report on their collection of child support arrearages and interest on child support obligations.

Permits certain delays in State plan compliance with such additional requirements if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that State legislation is required for such purpose.</summary>
