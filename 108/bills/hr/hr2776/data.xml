  <summary date="2003-07-31T22:39:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act - Prohibits either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture from taking any action which would permanently close or render or declare as unserviceable any aircraft landing strip located on Federal land under the respective jurisdiction, unless: (1) the head of the aviation department of each State in which the aircraft landing strip is located has approved such action; (2) notice of the proposed action has been published in the Federal Register; (3) a 90-day public comment period on the action has been provided; and (4) any comments received during the comment period have been taken into consideration by the Secretaries, as the case may be, and the appropriate State aviation department heads.

Directs the Secretaries to: (1) adopt a nationwide policy for governing backcountry aviation issues related to the management of Federal land under their jurisdiction; and (2) require regional managers to adhere to it. Declares that a policy affecting air access to an aircraft landing strip located on Federal land (including any national policy required under this Act) shall not take effect unless certain conditions are met, including its statement that the FAA has the sole authority to control aviation and airspace over the United States.</summary>
