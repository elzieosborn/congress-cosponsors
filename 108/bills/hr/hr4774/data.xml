  <summary date="2004-07-20T19:24:03Z" status="Introduced in House">FAIR (Foreign Air Impact Regulation) AIR Act of 2004 - Amends the Clean Air Act to delay the effective date of reclassification of a nonattainment area to a higher classification of nonattainment for failing to meet national ambient air quality standards by applicable deadlines if: (1) the area is adjacent to a foreign country; and (2) the State in which the area is located submits a claim to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency that the area would have attained the relevant standard by the attainment date but for emissions emanating from outside the United States.

Prohibits such reclassification from taking effect unless: (1) the Secretary of State has entered into negotiations with the foreign country involved to develop an air quality improvement plan for the international area encompassing the nonattainment area and submitted that plan to Congress; and (2) taking into consideration such plan, the Administrator has taken appropriate action to improve air quality in the nonattainment area.</summary>
