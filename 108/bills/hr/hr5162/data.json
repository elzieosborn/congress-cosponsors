    "text": "Requires each State to submit to the Attorney General a written report (and subsequent updates) that specifies each location at which a State law enforcement agency stores explosive materials that have been transported in interstate or foreign commerce and the types and amounts of such materials. Directs the Attorney General to prescribe final regulations governing the storage of such materials by such agencies, including public safety and security standards and requirements for video surveillance or an alarm system.\n\nAuthorizes the Attorney General to: (1) make matching grants to State and local law enforcement agencies for complying with such regulations; (2) enter any place where such an agency keeps such explosive materials for inspection and compliance determinations; and (3) reduce by ten percent the funds that an agency would otherwise receive under any Department of Justice grant program if the agency fails to comply."
