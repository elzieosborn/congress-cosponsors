Commends such Institutes for their support of such Networks and such Networks for their research toward improving women's pelvic health.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress as to efforts that such Institutes should undertake, including increasing their research, recruiting established scientists, and developing a national data registry and tissue bank of people suffering from incontinence."
