Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, at the request of all governments that nominated an area as a renewal community, to expand an area designated as such a community to include certain census tracts of general distress or with increased poverty rates based on 2000 census data; and (2) treat population census tracts with populations of less than 2,000 that are within empowerment zones and that are contiguous to a low income community as low-income communities for purposes of the new markets tax credit.</summary>
