    "text": "Rocky Flats Minerals Acquisition Act - Amends Federal law to permit the Secretary of the Interior to acquire mineral interests, including interests in sand and gravel, within the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Colorado, by purchase, exchange, issuance of credits, or any combination thereof. Defines credits as legal instruments or other written documentation, or an entry in an account managed by the Secretary, that can be used for: (1) bonus bids for lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf; or (2) royalty due on any oil or gas production under any lease of an area located in a specified part of the Outer Continental Shelf.\n\nDeclares that the requirement under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 that lands or interests exchanged under a section of such Act must be located in the same State shall not apply to land or an interest in land in the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge that is acquired by the United States in an exchange under that section.\n\nStates that any interests acquired by the United States under this Act shall be managed by the Secretary under the standards that apply to the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. Declares that no minerals acquired under this Act shall be subject to development or disposal by the United States or any other party under any law related to minerals owned by the United States."
