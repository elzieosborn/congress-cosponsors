        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise disclosure requirements for tax-exempt political organizations. Requires such an organization to make monthly reports in any election year in which it accepts contributions or makes expenditures of $25,000 or more. Requires quarterly reports for organizations with less than $25,000 in contributions or expenditures, but requires a change to monthly reporting upon receipt of contributions in excess of $25,000 or the making of expenditures greater than $25,000. Requires: (1) pre-election and post-election reports; and (2) semiannual reports in years in which a regularly scheduled election is not held.</p> <p>Requires: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to take actions to increase disclosure to the public of tax-exempt political organization reporting; and (2) the Secretary and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to take actions to improve the linkage between the databases for public disclosure of election related information maintained by the Department of the Treasury and the FEC.</p>]]></text>
