States that cancer satisfies that requirement.Requires civil actions involving an asbestos claim to include the filing of a doctor-signed narrative medical report and diagnosis which: (1) delineates an employment and exposure history; (2) delineates a medical and smoking history; (3) certifies that 15 years have elapsed from first exposure to diagnosis; (4) certifies a certain level of opacity or pleural thickening on a chest x-ray or pathological evidence of a certain grade of asbestosis; (5) certifies a certain level of asbestos-related pulmonary impairment; and (6) contains other reports and statements as required.Sets forth required technical standards as well as rules governing consolidation, venue, removal, and the statute of limitations."
