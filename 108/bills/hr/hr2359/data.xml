(Sec. 3) Authorizes use of the employment eligibility confirmation system for Government agency inquiries, including provision of citizenship or immigration status information in addition to identity and employment eligibility information. (Current law prohibits such access except as provided for under a pilot program.)

(Sec. 4) Expands the basic pilot program to all States. (Current law limits the program to at least five of the seven States with the highest illegal alien population.)</summary>
