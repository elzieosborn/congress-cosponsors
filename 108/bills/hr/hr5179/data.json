    "text": "Social Security Solvency Act of 2004 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) revise requirements for calculating the contribution and benefit base with respect to remuneration paid (including self-employment income derived) during the calendar years between 2005 and 2037; and (2) apply the chained consumer price index for all urban consumers in determining cost-of-living increases in benefits.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the unified credit against the estate tax, to set the applicable exclusion amount permanently at $3.5 million (the amount currently set for 2009).\n\nMakes appropriations (and requires transfers from the General Fund) at least quarterly to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund equivalent to estate taxes and taxes on generation-skipping transfers.\n\nAmends SSA title II to require the statement of projected insolvency in the annual report of the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds to include: (1) the Board's best estimate of the date as of which the Trust Funds will, with no change in employment tax rates, first have assets insufficient to pay scheduled benefits in full on a timely basis; and (2) if such date is within two years after the filing of the report, the minimum increase necessary in such tax rates necessary to preclude such an insufficiency period.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for future adjustment of employment tax rates to keep the Social Security Trust Funds in balance."
