  <summary date="2004-12-20T20:40:39Z" status="Introduced in House">Methamphetamine Abuse Prevention Act of 2004 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to: (1) reduce the retail sales threshold for the sale of products containing pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine products from nine grams to six grams; and (2) eliminate the "regulated transaction" exemption for any over-the-counter sale of such products (including blister packs) by retail distributors.

Prohibits any State, political subdivision, or State authorized entity from establishing any requirement for retail sales of any pseudoephedrine drug product that is different from the requirements that apply to such products under this Act. Makes this provision inapplicable to any requirement enacted prior to January 1, 2005, other than a requirement allowing any individual to purchase more than six grams of pseudoephedrine base in any single retail transaction. Allows the State to adopt penalties that are different from penalties that apply under this Act.

 Authorizes exemptions from this prohibition upon a determination by the Attorney General that pseudoephedrine drug products obtained in the State are being used as a significant source of precursor chemicals for illegal manufacture of a controlled substance for distribution or sale, that the requirement is likely to substantially decrease such use, and that the requirement will not unduly burden interstate commerce. Sets forth provisions governing judicial review.</summary>
