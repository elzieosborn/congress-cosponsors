  <summary date="2004-03-10T19:20:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Winning the Peace Act of 2003 - Authorizes the President to designate a Director of Reconstruction for, and to provide assistance for reconstruction services for, each country or region in which the U.S. armed forces have engaged in armed conflict or which will receive reconstruction services from the U.S. Government due to armed conflict.

Gives the Director authority over all reconstruction activities of the U.S. Government within the country or region of operation.

Authorizes the Secretary of State to establish a permanent office to provide support to each Director.

Authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to establish an Office of International Emergency Management to: (1) maintain a database of entities with expertise in providing reconstruction services; and (2) provide support for mobilizing such entities to provide services requested by a country or region Director.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretaries of State and Defense should propose to establish within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) an Integrated Security Support Component to prepare NATO units for reconstruction-related security tasks. Authorizes the President to commit U.S. personnel to such a Component.

Requires the Secretary of State to establish an interagency Training Center for Post-Conflict Reconstruction Operations.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) establish a task force to implement a reserve force of law enforcement officers willing to provide reconstruction services overseas; and (2) direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to review immigration rules for aliens admitted for permanent residence who wish to participate in return of talent programs in their country of origin.

Establishes a U.S. Security Development Fund.</summary>
