Authorizes the President to commit U.S. personnel to such a Component.\n\nRequires the Secretary of State to establish an interagency Training Center for Post-Conflict Reconstruction Operations.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) establish a task force to implement a reserve force of law enforcement officers willing to provide reconstruction services overseas; and (2) direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to review immigration rules for aliens admitted for permanent residence who wish to participate in return of talent programs in their country of origin.\n\nEstablishes a U.S. Security Development Fund."
