Permits the trading of allowances under any U.S. or internationally recognized carbon dioxide reduction program.Establishes a carbon dioxide allowance transfer system. Revises the new source review program to cover unit changes after 2008 and to permit the lowest achievable emission rate standard to take cost into account. Revises the sulfur dioxide allowance program to establish an allowance reserve for new units and to establish maximum emissions for states in the Western Regional Air Partnership."
