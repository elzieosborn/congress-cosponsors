  <summary date="2004-03-04T19:15:08Z" status="Introduced in House">ILSA Enhancement and Compliance Act - Amends the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 to urge the President to immediately commence diplomatic efforts to establish a multilateral sanctions regime against Libya (currently limited to Iran). Expands reporting requirements by the President to Congress to cover Libya and specified governmental actions and assistance with respect to Iran or Libya.

Authorizes the President to suspend the application of sanctions upon certification that: (1) the suspension is vital to national security; and (2) the country has undertaken substantial measures to prevent the acquisition and development of weapons of mass destruction by the Government of Iran or Libya.

Directs the President: (1) upon disclosure of specified activity related to investment in Iran or Libya, to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to initiate an investigation; and (2) to impose two or more of specified mandatory sanctions upon determining that a person has provided to Iran or Libya any goods, services, technology, or other items which significantly and materially contributed to their ability to acquire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons or specified other capabilities.

Makes specified sanctions under the Act mandatory. Repeals the Act's sunset provision.

Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an Office of Global Security Risk to: (1) establish a process for identifying all issuers that are operating in countries (particularly Iran and Libya) whose governments have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism; and (2) ensure and enhance issuer disclosures regarding operations, risks of operating, and activities in such countries.</summary>
