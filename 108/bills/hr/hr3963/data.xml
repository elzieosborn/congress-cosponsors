Covers legislative branch employees under the Federal Judicial Code rules protecting jurors' employment.

Applies administrative and judicial dispute-resolution procedures of the Act for violations of certain rights and protections under: (1) the Employee Polograph Protection Act of 1988; (2) the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act; and (3) Federal law regarding veterans' employment and reemployment.
