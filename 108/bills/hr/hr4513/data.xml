  <summary date="2004-06-18T20:05:50Z" status="Passed House amended">Declares that, with respect to any authorization for a renewable energy project and the attendant preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, a Federal agency is not required to: (1) identify alternative project locations or actions other than the proposed action and the no action alternative; or (2) analyze the environmental effects of alternative locations or actions other than those submitted by the project proponent.

Requires such agency, in any such assessment or impact statement, to identify and analyze solely the environmental effects and potential mitigation measures of: (1) the proposed action; and (2) the no action alternative.

Provides that, in preparing an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, such agency shall only consider public comments that specifically address the preferred action and that are filed within 20 days after publication of a draft environmental assessment or draft environmental impact statement.

Defines "renewable energy project," for purpose of this Act, as: (1) any proposal to utilize an energy source other than nuclear power, coal, oil, or natural gas; and (2) including but not limited to the use of wind, solar, geothermal, or tidal forces to generate energy.</summary>
