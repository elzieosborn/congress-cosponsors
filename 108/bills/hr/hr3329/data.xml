Requires the Inspector General of each executive agency to: (1) periodically conduct risk assessments of the agency's purchase card program and associated internal controls and analyze identified weaknesses and the frequency of improper activity; (2) perform periodic audits of purchase cardholders; (3) report to the agency head on the results of such audits; and (4) report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Comptroller General on implementation of recommendations made to the agency head to address findings during audits.

Amends the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998 to direct each executive agency head that has employees that use travel charge cards to establish and maintain specified safeguards and internal controls. Requires the Inspector General of each executive agency to: (1) periodically conduct risk assessments of the agency's travel card program and associated internal controls and analyze identified weaknesses and the frequency of improper activity; (2) perform periodic audits of travel cardholders; (3) report to the agency head the results of such audits; and (4) report to the OMB Director and the Comptroller General on implementation of recommendations made to the agency head to address findings during audits.</summary>
