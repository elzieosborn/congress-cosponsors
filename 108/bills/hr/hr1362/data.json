    "text": "Violence Against Children Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prescribe penalties to be imposed for injuring or attempting to injure a person under 18 years of age (including life imprisonment if death results or if the offense includes kidnaping, aggravated sexual abuse, or attempting to kill) under circumstances in which: (1) the conduct occurs during the course of, or as a result of, the travel of the defendant or victim across a State line or national border; or (2) in connection with such conduct, the defendant employs a weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. Directs the: (1) United States Sentencing Commission to review and amend its guidelines to provide enhanced penalties when the victim of a Federal crime is under 18; and (2) the Comptroller General to review State penalties and sentencing guidelines for crimes against children.Requires the Attorney General: (1) at the request of a State, Indian tribal government, or local government, to provide assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of any felony crime of violence against a child; and (2) to award grants to develop and strengthen effective law enforcement and prosecution of crimes against children and to provide education, prevention, intervention, and victims' assistance services regarding crimes against children.Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to reauthorize regional Children's Advocacy Centers.Requires each State receiving: (1) law enforcement grants under this Act to have in place a statewide AMBER Alert communications network for child abduction cases and to use the National Incident-Based Reporting System; (2) education, prevention, and victims' assistance grants to have in effect a statute allowing a parent to leave a newborn baby at a hospital anonymously; and (3) certain allotments for child welfare allotments to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a report on the State's funded program, including the process for maintaining records and verifying the well-being of the children under the State's care."
