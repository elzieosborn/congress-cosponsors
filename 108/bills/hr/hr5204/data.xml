  <summary date="2005-01-11T13:49:20Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consider the ratio of residents in children's hospitals' approved graduate medical residency training programs to beds (but excluding beds or bassinets assigned to healthy new born infants) when determining the amount of payments to such hospitals for indirect expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill patients and the additional costs associated with teaching residents in such programs.</summary>
