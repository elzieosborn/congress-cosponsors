Repeals a consumer's right to rescind a credit transaction as against an assignee.

Extends joint and several liability to the mortgage assignee, the original creditor, and prior or subsequent assignees for material violations committed by the original creditor, to the extent that the violation is apparent on the face of the disclosure.

Revises the limitation on damages to: (1) provide that a cause of action for a liability may be asserted by the borrower only in an individual action; (2) limit the amount of relief to the total amount that the borrower has paid in connection with the loan, including reasonable attorney's fees; (3) bar such action from being brought after the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the violation giving rise to the liability; and (4) provide that such cause of action shall constitute the exclusive remedy of the consumer against an assignee of a mortgage.
