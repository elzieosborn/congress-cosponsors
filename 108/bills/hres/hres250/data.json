    "text": "Condemns the recent wave of terrorism in the Middle East, including the bombings of May 12 in Saudi Arabia, May 17 in Morocco, and May 17-19 in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Expresses deepest condolences to the families, relatives, and friends of the victims.\n\nCommits to strengthening U.S. efforts in the global war against terrorism and urges all states, including those in the Arab world, to intensify their anti-terrorist efforts, especially their anti-terrorist cooperation with the United States.\n\nDeclares that it is imperative that Saudi Arabia, in particular, fully cooperate with all U.S. anti-terrorist investigations, cease preaching of anti-Western, anti-U.S., anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israeli hatred in its schools, media, and mosques, and that it block all funding of Islamic terrorist groups by Saudi nationals.\n\nConcludes that the murderous attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, including suicide bombings, perpetrated by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, and other terrorist organizations are part of a global terrorist campaign. Affirms that there can be no progress toward Middle East peace until the Palestinian Authority takes decisive action against terrorism."
