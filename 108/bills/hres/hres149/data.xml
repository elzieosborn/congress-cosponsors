The summary of that version is repeated here.)Offers the condolences of the House of Representatives and its deepest sympathy to the people of Serbia and the family of Zoran Djindjic following the assassination of Prime Minister Djindjic.States that the House of Representatives understands that organized criminal groups within Serbian society continue to threaten the free and democratic government of Serbia and Montenegro.Recognizes that while implementing necessary reforms and cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia may carry significant risks for the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro, these reforms and this cooperation are necessary and must continue.Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) support continued democratic reforms initiated by Zoran Djindjic; (2) urge his successors to dedicate themselves to continue to support his road to reform; and (3) pledge to assist Serbia and its new leadership in accomplishing these necessary reforms, including efforts to fight organized crime and corruption.</summary>
