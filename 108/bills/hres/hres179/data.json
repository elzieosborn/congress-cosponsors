The summary of that version is repeated here.)Condemns the brutal crackdown of the Cuban Government on the island's peaceful pro-democracy movement.Calls for the immediate release of all Cuban political prisoners.Supports the right of the Cuban people to exercise fundamental political and civil liberties, including freedom of expression, assembly, association, movement, press, and the right to multiparty elections.Calls on the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations and other International Organizations in Geneva, Switzerland, to work with the member countries of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to ensure a resolution that includes the strongest possible condemnation of the current crackdown of dissidents and of the gross human rights violations committed by the Cuban Government.Calls on the Latin American and Caribbean group (GRULAC) at the Commission to exclude Cuba from its slate of candidates for the Commission, and urges all member nations to oppose renewing Cuba's membership on the Commission until the Government of Cuba adheres to international human rights standards, such as those delineated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
