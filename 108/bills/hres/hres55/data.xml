  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) United Nations (UN) weapons inspectors should be given sufficient time to carry out the inspections that are necessary for an assessment of the level of compliance by the Government of Iraq with UN Security Council Resolution 1441 (2002); (2) the United States and other member nations of the UN Security Council should work together to exhaust all peaceful and diplomatic means for disarming Iraq before launching an invasion of Iraq; (3) international emissaries (including European and Arab leaders) should be given time to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq voluntarily and avert war; (4) before initiating any offensive military operations in Iraq to enforce Resolution 1441, the United States should seek authorization for the use of force from the UN Security Council; (5) the United States should re-engage in the Middle East peace process in an effort to end the violence between Israel and the Palestinians; and (6) the United States should redouble its efforts to secure the U.S. homeland in light of the growing number of intelligence assessments highlighting U.S. vulnerability for further terrorist attacks.</summary>
