  <summary date="2006-11-28T17:35:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Urges the Secretary of Education to continue the longstanding commitment of the United States to the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, serving on active duty (including Reserves), by providing assistance and flexibility with their transition into and out of postsecondary education.Urges all institutions offering postsecondary education to provide a full refund of tuition and fees and other charges to students who are members of the Armed Forces, serving on active duty (including Reserves), for that portion of a period of instruction the student was unable to complete, or for which that individual did not receive academic credit, because he or she was called up for such service.Urges all postsecondary institutions to make every effort, if an individual withdraws from a course of study as a result of such service, to minimize deferral of enrollment or reapplication requirements and to provide the greatest flexibility possible with administrative deadlines related to those applications.Urges lending institutions holding or servicing Federal student loans for a borrower called to such service to provide all available benefits, forbearance, deferrals, and flexibility with respect to such loans as necessary to ensure that such borrowers who are called to active duty are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to those loans because of such service.</summary>
