States that the House of Representatives: (1) expresses sympathy to the families of those killed, tortured, and imprisoned as a result of their participation in the democracy protests of June 3-4, 1989, in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in the People's Republic of China, and to all those persons who have suffered for their efforts to keep that struggle alive, and to all the people of China who lack fundamental human rights; (2) commends all persons who are peacefully advocating for democracy and human rights in China; (3) calls upon those nations participating in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing to urge China to fully comply with the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights; (4) calls upon the Communist Government of China to honor its pledge of a `high degree of autonomy' made at the time of the Hong Kong reversion in 1997 by permitting immediate elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and by leaving all revisions of Hong Kong law to a legislature elected by universal suffrage; and (5) condemns the human rights abuses by the Communist Government of China, and calls on that Government to reevaluate the official verdict on the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen pro-democracy activities and order formal investigations into the reported killing, torture, and imprisonment of democracy activists, establish a June Fourth Investigation Committee, release all prisoners of conscience, provide just compensation to the families of persons killed in such protests, allow the return of persons exiled for their activities in 1989, release Dr. Yang Jianli, and end the harassment and detention of all Chinese citizens exercising their legitimate freedoms of expression, association, and religion.</summary>
