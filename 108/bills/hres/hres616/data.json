    "text": "Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) all countries should recognize the seriousness of anti-Semitic acts and should take action against those individuals and entities that incite hatred and perpetrate criminal acts against Jewish populations; (2) member countries of the European Union (EU) should continue to officially and publicly repudiate those individuals and entities that carry out such acts and should undertake tougher and more unified measures to combat the growth of anti-Semitic violence and intimidation throughout the European continent; (3) the EU should protect the safety of their Jewish communities through the establishment of the position of a director to monitor and combat anti-Semitism within the EU through education, media analysis, and coordination with responsible partners in each EU member country; (4) the delegates from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Conference on Anti-Semitism should call on their governments to make anti-Semitism a criminal offense and should establish within the OSCE a framework to monitor anti-Semitic activities, to monitor legislation to combat anti-Semitism, to coordinate between law enforcement organizations in such countries, and to implement relevant educational programs for the next generation of Europeans; (5) the President should direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to work with EU member countries to secure passage of a resolution condemning anti-Semitism at the upcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly; and (6) combating acts of anti-Semitism worldwide through diplomatic efforts should be a U.S. foreign policy priority."
