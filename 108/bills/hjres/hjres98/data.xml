  <summary date="2004-07-02T19:59:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Declares that the United States acting through Congress: (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship the Indian tribes have with it and the solemn covenant with the land we share; (2) commends and honors the Native Peoples for the thousands of years that they have stewarded and protected this land; (3) acknowledges years of official depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes; (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on them by U.S. citizens; (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former offenses and its commitment to build on the positive relationships of the past and present to move toward a brighter future where all the people of this land live reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward and protect this land together; (6) urges the President to acknowledge the offenses of the United States against Indian tribes in U.S. history in order to bring healing to this land by providing a proper foundation for reconciliation between such entities; and (7) commends the State governments that have begun reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located in their boundaries and encourages all State governments similarly to do the same.

Provides that nothing in this Joint Resolution authorizes any claim against the United States or serves as a settlement of any claim against it.</summary>
