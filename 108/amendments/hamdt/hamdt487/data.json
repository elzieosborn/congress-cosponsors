  "purpose": "An amendment in the nature of a substitute numbered 1 printed in House Report 108-446 to provide $43.3 billion in additional spending and $5.0 billion for deficit reduction in FY 2005. The total is offset by rescinding the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 for individuals making more than $200,000 in gross income, by closing tax loopholes, certain tax shelters and methods of tax avoidance, and reducing funding for the ballistic missile defense program. The spending increase includes $30.5 billion in spending over the resolution's FY 2005 levels for non-defense programs and an additional $12.8 billion for defense, homeland security and veterans programs.",
