  <description>Amendment added to the bill the text of the "Pretrial Detention and Lifetime Supervision of Terrorists Act of 2004".</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered eleven printed in House Report 108-751 to create a rebuttable presumption that no amount of bail or other conditions would assure the appearance in court of a defendant when he is charged with a terrorist offense and there is probable cause that the defendant committed certain terrorist attacks. Helps to prevent further terrorist acts by giving judges the discretion to impose up to lifetime supervision of terrorists who have been convicted of terrorist offenses.</purpose>
