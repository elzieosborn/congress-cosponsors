  <description>Amendment sought to authorize a Gasoline Availability Stabilization (GAS) Reserve program with a total capacity of 20 million barrels of regular unleaded gasoline with reserve sites in California, the Midwest, the Northeast, and two additional sites as identified by the Secretary of Energy.</description>
