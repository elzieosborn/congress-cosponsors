  <description>Amendment sought to prohibit funds to the Federal Communications Commission for implementing new media ownership rules.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to prohibit any funds in the bill for the Federal Communications Commission to implement part of its recent ruling which would allow ownership of a newspaper and radio or television station in the same market. The amendment would prohibit the use of funds for the granting of a radio or television broadcast station license if the owner also directly or indirectly owns, operates or controls a daily newspaper in the same region, or, with certain exceptions, the granting of the license would result in the party controlling two television stations in the same Designated Market Area.</purpose>
