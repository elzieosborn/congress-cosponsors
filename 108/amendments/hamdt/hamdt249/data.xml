  <description>Amendment adds language expressing the sense of Congress regarding the extradition of violent criminals from Mexico to the United States.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 37 printed in House Report 108-206 to express the sense of Congress that the Executive Branch of the Mexican Government should work closely with the Mexican Supreme Court in order to persuade the court to reconsider its October 2001 ruling so that the possibility of a life imprisonment sentence would not interfere with the timely extradition of criminal suspects from Mexico to the United States.</purpose>
