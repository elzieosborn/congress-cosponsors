  <description>An amendment numbered 33 printed in the Congressional Record of Wednesday, October 15, 2003. The amendment seeks to make the first fifty percent of Iraq reconstruction funding available immediately as a grant giving priority consideration to the emergency purposes of security, electric sector infrastructure, oil infrastructure, public works, water resources, transportation, telecommunication infrastructures and other emergency needs. It also provides that once the administration informs Congress that a democratically elected government in Iraq has been established, the balance of funding would be made available in the form of loans from the U.S. government, under terms determined by the president.</description>
