  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to allow participants in a flexible spending arrangement (FSA) to roll over up to $500 in unused benefits from one year to the next; and offset the costs of the bill by including tax provisions to prevent corporate expatriation to avoid United States income tax.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment printed in part A of House Report 108-484 and made in order pursuant to H. Res. 638 to allow participants in an FSA to roll over up to $500 in unused benefits from one year to the next; would not allow participants to transfer up to $500 in unused benefits froman FSA to a Health Savings Account (HSA); and is offset by including tax provisions designed to eliminate abusive transactions engaged in by Enron as recommended by the Joint Committee on Taxation and to prevent the avoidance of corporate tax by American corporations reincorporating overseas.</purpose>
