  <summary date="2023-06-09T12:14:16Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution reaffirms the interest of the United States in mutually beneficial relations with Mexico based on shared interests on security, economic prosperity, and democratic values.

The resolution reaffirms support for stronger economic relations with Mexico, including to strengthen the resiliency of critical supply chains in North America and the Western Hemisphere in general.

The resolution expresses deep concerns about the worsening investment climate in Mexico, and calls on the President to take meaningful actions to defend U.S. economic interests in Mexico and uphold the integrity of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The resolution also urges the President to address the humanitarian and security crisis at the border with Mexico.</summary>
