Specifically, the resolution encourages India to amend discriminatory laws and executive orders to treat Muslims the same as other religious groups. It also urges India to return citizenship to those declared non-citizens by its National Register for Citizens, to release individuals unnecessarily detained, and to repeal anti-conversion and anti-blasphemy laws widely misused against Christians.</summary>
