  <summary date="2023-04-19T21:05:57Z" status="Introduced in Senate">World Health Organization Pandemic Treaty Implementation Resolution

This resolution prohibits any international agreement that is drafted by the World Health Organization and relates to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response from legally binding the United States unless the Senate ratifies the agreement as a treaty. The bill also outlines requirements for negotiating and ratifying such an agreement.

The Department of State must (1) consult closely and on a timely basis with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations while negotiating the agreement, and (2) designate at least two Members of that committee to serve as advisors to the negotiation. The State Department must consult with the advisors immediately before initialing the agreement and keep them fully apprised of the negotiations.

Additionally, the President must submit to the Senate the agreement (and all annexes and related materials) within 60 days of signing it. The President must also certify that the submitted materials constitute the totality of the agreement and that adopting the agreement serves U.S. national interests.

Members may object to the consideration of any legislation that implements the agreement until the President submits it to the Senate for ratification.</summary>
