This resolution modifies the requirements for raising and waiving several budget points of order that apply to legislation in the Senate. Among other modifications, the resolution requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senate to waive certain budget points of order. (Under current law, most budget points of order may be waived by a vote of three-fifths of the Senate.)</summary>
