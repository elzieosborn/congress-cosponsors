 the federal government should adopt a global health solidarity strategy to end medically unnecessary deaths and respond to the full burden of disease in poor countries; the federal government should use laws and diplomatic influence to stop ongoing economic harms to developing countries; and it is the duty of the federal government to issue reparations, including for slavery and colonialism.</summary>
