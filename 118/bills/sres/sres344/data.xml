  <summary date="2024-11-14T16:23:30Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution expresses that a lack of sufficient progress by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries in achieving a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense spending is politically and economically unsustainable. The resolution also (1) commends certain NATO member countries for contributing to 10% or more of NATO's direct funding and programs budget, (2) commends certain NATO member countries for meeting or exceeding their defense spending commitment, and (3) commends certain NATO member countries for contributing significant weapons and equipment to Ukraine.</summary>
