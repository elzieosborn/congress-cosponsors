  <summary date="2024-12-02T20:43:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should consider S. 81, which prohibits the award of federal research grants to institutions of higher education or research institutes that conduct gain-of-function research. (Under the bill, gain-of-function research refers to any research that (1) could confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity or transmissibility in an organism; or (2) involves methods that could enhance potential pandemic pathogens or related risky research with potentially dangerous pathogens.)</summary>
