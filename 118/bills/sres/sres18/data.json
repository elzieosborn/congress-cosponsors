An objection raised on these grounds may be waived or suspended by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nThe resolution further permits an objection to the consideration of any measure that has not been publicly available in electronic form for the mandatory minimum review period. This period is the greater of (1) the number of minutes that are equal to two times the number of pages in the measure, or (2) 72 hours, as calculated from the time the measure is made publicly available.\n\nThe resolution also requires Senators to certify that they have read each measure prior to voting on it."
