  <summary date="2024-11-26T18:28:19Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution expresses the sense that the United States should recognize the 1994 genocide in Rwanda as&#160;the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, and that the Department of State should publicly affirm that terminology. The resolution also expresses that other types of atrocities occurred in Rwanda in 1994, and that the history of the genocide should clearly affirm the other experiences of mass violence against Rwandans during the same period.</summary>
