  <summary date="2024-03-29T22:55:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution supports observing National Girls and Women in Sports Day on February 7, 2024, to recognize (1) all women athletes who represent schools, universities, and the United States in their athletic pursuits; and (2) the vital role that the people of the United States have in empowering girls and women in sports.

The resolution supports (1) marking the observation of such day with legislative efforts to build on the success of the Equal Pay for Team USA Act of 2022 and ensure equal pay for female athletes and to protect and uphold title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 so that future generations of athletes will not have to experience inequitable and unfair treatment; and (2) efforts to promote gender equity in sports, including equal pay and equal access to athletic opportunities for girls and women, and to support the U.S. commitment to expanding athletic participation for all girls and future generations of women athletes.</summary>
