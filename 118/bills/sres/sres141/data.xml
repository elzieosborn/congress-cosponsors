  <summary date="2023-11-14T22:06:27Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution affirms the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in peace, security, and stability between countries in the Indo-Pacific region.

Promoting deepening cooperation between ASEAN member states, the resolution supports several accomplishments by ASEAN and its member states, including the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, the 10th anniversary of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, and Indonesia on its successful leadership as chair of the G20 (an international forum consisting of 19 countries, the European Union, and the African Union) and United States-ASEAN country coordinator in 2022.

The resolution also encourages ASEAN to play an active role in ending violence in Burma and supports the Burmese people in their quest for democracy, peace, and reconciliation.</summary>
