  <summary date="2024-01-18T22:35:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution addresses constitutional concerns related to Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, which provides for collective action by NATO members when a member is attacked.

Specifically, the resolution expresses that, even if the President determines it is necessary to engage U.S. forces in hostilities in order to meet U.S. obligations under Article V, such action does not supersede the constitutional requirement that Congress declare war or authorize the use of military force prior to the United States engaging in hostilities.</summary>
