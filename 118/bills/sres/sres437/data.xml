  <summary date="2024-01-05T13:07:18Z" status="Passed Senate">This resolution strongly condemns any instances of antisemitism occurring at colleges and universities in the United States.

The resolution also

 encourages higher education leaders (e.g., presidents, deans, and administrators) to publicly condemn speech that incites or celebrates violence against any people based on religious beliefs, national origin, or ancestry; and encourages institutions of higher education to engage with Jewish student organizations and ensure that Jewish students, faculty, and staff can pursue their academic and personal aspirations without fear.</summary>
