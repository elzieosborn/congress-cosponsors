  <summary date="2024-02-06T23:18:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution generally permits the Senate to consider up to 10 nominations for most federal positions using a single motion to proceed (a proposal, typically offered by the Majority Leader, to bring a measure, nomination, or treaty to the Senate floor for debate and vote). However, certain nominations still require individual motions to proceed, namely nominations for Cabinet officials and other positions at Level I of the Executive Service, appellate judges, and Supreme Court Justices.</summary>
