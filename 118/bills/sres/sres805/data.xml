  <summary date="2025-08-18T19:51:15Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution condemns the practice of wrongfully detaining Americans in order to threaten American sovereignty and recognizes August 19, 2014, as a solemn remembrance of this national security threat. (The American journalist James Wright Foley was killed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria [ISIS] on August 19, 2014.)&#160;

The resolution also states that the Senate (1) stands with all those who have been taken hostage or wrongfully detained, those who have been released, and their families and friends; (2) commends the personnel who have endeavored to recover Americans held captive abroad; (3) prioritizes the return of all innocent U.S. nationals targeted for kidnapping or wrongful detention abroad; and (4) supports efforts to ensure that the U.S. hostage enterprise has proper resources and is authorized to address evolving threats.</summary>
