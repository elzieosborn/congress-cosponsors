  <summary date="2023-12-20T21:05:23Z" status="Passed Senate">This resolution demands that the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China (CPC) immediately release Mark Swidan. The resolution also condemns the Chinese government and the CPC for denying Swidan access to U.S. diplomats and independent and competent medical care. Swidan is a U.S. citizen who was convicted of drug-related charges in China and sentenced to death. A U.N. working group on arbitrary detention considers Swidan's detention arbitrary and in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</summary>
