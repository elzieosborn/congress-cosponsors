Specifically, it calls for coverage that (1) denies murderers a public platform; (2) minimizes the potential for media reporting to increase the likelihood of future mass public murders (i.e., the media contagion effect); and (3) prioritizes the victims of, and heroism in the response to, mass public murders."
