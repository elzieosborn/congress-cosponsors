    "text": "This joint resolution nullifies the final rule issued by the Federal Communications Commission titled The Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alerts and published on September 6, 2024. The rule establishes a new emergency alert code for missing and endangered persons incidents that do not meet the criteria for AMBER Alerts. (To warrant an AMBER Alert, an incident must generally involve the suspected abduction of a child age 17 years or under and a belief by law enforcement that the child is at serious risk of injury or death.) Emergency alert codes are used to facilitate the distribution of emergency messages through the national Emergency Alert System (for messages delivered through radio and television broadcasts) and the Wireless Emergency Alert system (for messages delivered to mobile phones).\u00a0"
