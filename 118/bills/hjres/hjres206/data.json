The rule updates the requirements related to minimum distributions from a qualified plan to reflect statutory changes made by the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 and SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022. The rule, among other things, increases the required minimum distribution age from 72 to 75 in two steps over a 10-year period and requires all distributions to be made by the end of the 10th year after death (with some exceptions).\u00a0"
