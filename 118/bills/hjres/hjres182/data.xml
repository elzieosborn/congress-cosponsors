  <summary date="2024-11-13T20:06:34Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution nullifies the Department of Health and Human Services rule titled Designated Placement Requirements for LGBTQI plus Children, which was issued on April 30, 2024.

The rule sets forth procedures that state and tribal child welfare agencies (and associated federally funded contractors) must follow when implementing case plans for children in foster care who identify as LGBTQI+, including a requirement for agencies to ensure&#160;that such children have access to a specially designated foster care placement.</summary>
