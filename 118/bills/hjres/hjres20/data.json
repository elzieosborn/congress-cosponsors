Senators who serve two consecutive terms and Representatives who serve six consecutive terms become ineligible to serve until the second Congress that begins after their last consecutive term.\n\nThis term limit shall not apply to any Member in the 118th Congress unless there is a break in the Member's service.\n\nAdditionally, if a person is appointed to fill a vacancy, the appointed term does not count towards the consecutive term limit unless the person serves more than three years as a Senator or one year as a Representative."
