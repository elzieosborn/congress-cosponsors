Not later than 60 days after ratification of the amendment, Congress shall enact legislation to\n\n limit the amounts that candidates, their campaigns for federal office, and political parties may spend on such candidacies; provide public funding for all federal candidates who qualify for the ballot; require disposition to the Treasury of any unspent campaign funds after each election, without compensation; and enforce, with civil and criminal penalties, the limits and prohibitions of the amendment. States shall have the power to implement and enforce reasonable regulations on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence state or local elections."
