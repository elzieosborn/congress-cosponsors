This joint resolution repeals the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorizes the President to employ U.S. military forces against any nation, organization, or persons determined to have planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, or harbored such persons.

This joint resolution also authorizes the President to use necessary and appropriate military force to defend against a direct and substantial armed attack against the United States, or a threat of such an attack, from Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the Islamic State Khorasan organization based in Afghanistan, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. This authority sunsets four years after enactment.</summary>
