The final rule provides guidance on the tax credit for the production and sale of solar and wind components, inverters, some battery components, and critical minerals, which was added by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The rule, among other things, defines what produced by the taxpayer means for purposes of determining eligibility for the tax credit, details the requirements regarding sales between related and unrelated parties, and provides credit amounts and phase-out rules for certain components and critical minerals."
