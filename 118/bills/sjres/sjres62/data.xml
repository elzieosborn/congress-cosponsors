  <summary date="2024-04-01T14:10:40Z" status="Passed Senate">This joint resolution nullifies the final rule issued by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) titled Importation of Fresh Beef From Paraguay and published on November 14, 2023. The final rule allows for the importation of fresh (chilled or frozen) beef from Paraguay into the United States under certain conditions.

The United States prohibits or restricts the importation of certain animals and animal products to prevent the introduction of various animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). In response to a request from Paraguay to allow the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay into the United States, APHIS conducted a risk analysis. APHIS concluded that fresh beef could be safely imported from Paraguay, provided that certain conditions are met.

These conditions include that (1) FMD has not been diagnosed in the exporting region within the previous 12 months; (2) the meat originated from premises where FMD has not been present during the lifetime of any bovines slaughtered for U.S. meat export; and (3) APHIS may periodically conduct on-site evaluations and subsequent inspections of the slaughter facilities, records, and operations.</summary>
