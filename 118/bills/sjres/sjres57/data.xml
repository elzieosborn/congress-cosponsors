  <summary date="2024-05-15T15:58:34Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This joint resolution nullifies the Department of Treasury's rule titled Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds, which was issued on November 20, 2023.

The rule relates to the use of State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF), which were initially authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to help state and local governments respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Current regulations allow for the use of funds for authorized purposes by December 31, 2026, if such funds are obligated for expenditure by December 31, 2024.

The rule modifies the definition of an&#160;obligation&#160;to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements that are associated with the SLFRF program, such as reporting, audit, or environmental compliance requirements. Funds for these purposes are considered to be obligated by the required deadline of December 31, 2024. Estimated amounts of such obligations must be reported to Treasury by April 30, 2024, and the funds must still be used by December 31, 2026.</summary>
