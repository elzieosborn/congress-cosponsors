Current regulations allow for the use of funds for authorized purposes by December 31, 2026, if such funds are obligated for expenditure by December 31, 2024.\n\nThe rule modifies the definition of an\u00a0obligation\u00a0to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements that are associated with the SLFRF program, such as reporting, audit, or environmental compliance requirements. Funds for these purposes are considered to be obligated by the required deadline of December 31, 2024. Estimated amounts of such obligations must be reported to Treasury by April 30, 2024, and the funds must still be used by December 31, 2026."
