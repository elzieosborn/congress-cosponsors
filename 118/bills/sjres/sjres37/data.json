No funds may be used to support any decisions to suspend, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the treaty unless (1) both the House and the Senate pass a joint resolution approving withdrawal by a two-thirds vote, or (2) the funds are used pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\nThe President shall notify Congress in writing of any deliberation or decision to suspend, denounce, or withdraw from the treaty at least 180 days before taking such action. The President must also consult with Congress before providing such written notification.\n\nUpon adoption of a resolution by the appropriate chamber, the joint resolution also allows the Senate Legal Counsel and the General Counsel of the House of Representatives to represent Congress in judicial proceedings related to actions that are inconsistent with this resolution."
