  <summary date="2023-09-16T00:22:16Z" status="Passed House">This joint resolution nullifies the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service titled Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Species Status for Northern Long-Eared Bat and published on November 30, 2022. This rule reclassifies the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) from a threatened species to an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. The rule also removes the northern long-eared bat's species-specific rule, which applied only when the bat was listed as a threatened species.</summary>
