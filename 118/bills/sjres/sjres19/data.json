Receipts do not include receipts derived from borrowing.\n\nThe amendment requires Congress to achieve balance within 10 years of the ratification of the amendment.\n\nIn an emergency situation, two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate may authorize additional expenditures that are not otherwise permitted by the amendment. The additional expenditures must be for a limited time, and debts incurred from the expenditures must be paid as soon as practicable."
