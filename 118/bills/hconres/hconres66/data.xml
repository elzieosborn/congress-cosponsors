  <summary date="2024-11-14T17:57:01Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution expresses the sense that Russia bears responsibility for the financial burden of Ukraine's reconstruction and that the United States must utilize, to the fullest extent, the current cache of seized Russian assets for Ukrainian reconstruction. It calls on the President (1) to work internationally in response to the crisis, including the further imposition of sanctions; (2) to advocate for an international mechanism to determine the amount of reparations to be paid by Russia; and (3) to pressure Russia to pay those reparations.</summary>
