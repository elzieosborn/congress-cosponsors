  <summary date="2023-10-11T18:52:20Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution expresses congressional disapproval of the Department of the Interior's withdrawal of approximately 225,504 acres in the Superior National Forest from disposition under the United States mineral and geothermal leasing laws. On January 26, 2023, Interior removed the land from being available for new mineral leasing, sale of mineral materials, and geothermal leasing for a 20-year period, subject to valid existing rights. The land is located in Cook, Lake, and Saint Louis Counties, Minnesota and the Rainy River watershed, which includes the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and the 1854 Ceded Territory of the Chippewa Bands.</summary>
