 the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act does not prohibit elementary or secondary school students from discussing or sharing information about non-dairy milk alternatives with their classmates; parents and students should be provided with as much information as possible about school meal nutrition; and parents and students, in consultation with their physicians, should have as much choice as possible in the school lunch program.</summary>
