  <summary date="2023-11-27T17:56:06Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution calls on the media to voluntarily adopt certain practices to prevent further harm from its coverage of mass public murders. Specifically, it calls for coverage that (1) denies murderers a public platform; (2) minimizes the potential for media reporting to increase the likelihood of future mass public murders (i.e., the media contagion effect); and (3) prioritizes the victims of, and heroism in the response to, mass public murders.</summary>
