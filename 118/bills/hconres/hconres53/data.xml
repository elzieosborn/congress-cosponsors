  <summary date="2024-02-01T20:36:45Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution calls on the President to sign the Secure the Border Act of 2023 if it passes the Senate.

(The Secure the Border Act of 2023 makes various changes to immigration law, including by imposing limits on asylum eligibility and requiring employers to use an electronic system to verify the employment eligibility of new employees. At the time this concurrent resolution was introduced, that bill had passed the House of Representatives but not the Senate.)</summary>
