This bill prohibits certain types of scientific research or technical exchange between specified U.S. and Chinese entities. The bill's prohibition concerns research or exchange that could develop technologies identified by the Chinese Communist Party as priorities for its strategy to mobilize non-military resources and expertise for military application. Examples of such technologies include quantum computing, lasers, robotics, semiconductors, and aerospace technology.

The bill prohibits such research or exchange if it is conducted between (1) federal agencies that engage in research or provide funding for research, institutions of higher education or private research institutes that receive federal financial assistance, or companies headquartered in the United States that receive federal financial assistance; and (2) certain Chinese entities with connections to China's military, such as universities that receive funding from China's military or that host military laboratories.

The bill also requires the Department of Defense to establish and periodically update a website that includes a list of specific areas of research and exchange subject to this prohibition.</summary>
