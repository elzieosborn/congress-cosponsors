This bill authorizes a party in a civil suit to recover nonpecuniary damages (i.e., damages for loss of care, comfort, and companionship) when an individual dies as a result of a cruise ship accident that occurred on the high seas beyond 12 nautical miles from the U.S. shore. The nonpecuniary damages may be in addition to other damages, but punitive damages are not recoverable. Current law already permits these damages to be recovered if a death was caused by a commercial aviation accident on the high seas.</summary>
