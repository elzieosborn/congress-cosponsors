    "text": "Child Labor Exploitation Accountability Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure that any entity entering into a contract with USDA\u00a0discloses violations of specific labor laws to the Department of Labor (Labor). It also restricts USDA contracts with entities that disclose certain violations.\n\nSpecifically, beginning two years after the bill's enactment, any entity that enters into a contract with USDA must annually disclose to Labor whether any administrative merits determination, arbitral award or decision, or civil judgment has been issued against the entity (or a subcontractor of the entity) within the preceding three\u00a0years for violations of specific laws, executive orders,\u00a0and regulations (e.g., the National Labor Relations Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967). An entity that fails to disclose the required information is subject to criminal penalties.\n\nLabor must provide an entity an opportunity to report any steps taken to correct violations of, or improve compliance with, the labor laws. Labor may also negotiate corrective measures that the entity may take.\n\nLabor must annually submit to USDA a list of entities that (1) have serious, repeated, or pervasive labor law violations; or (2) have failed to complete any negotiated corrective measure. Further, USDA is prohibited\u00a0from soliciting a contract from, and conducting meat and poultry inspections for, any entity on Labor's list for five years.\u00a0\n\nUSDA must report to Congress annually on the number of entities (1) on Labor's list, and (2) that have agreed to take corrective measures.\u00a0"
