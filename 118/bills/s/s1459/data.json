An air carrier must offer a full refund to an individual with a disability who is traveling with a wheelchair and cannot fly on the existing aircraft because the cargo hold cannot physically accommodate the wheelchair.\n\nDOT must also\n\nevaluate data on the mishandling of wheelchairs on aircraft (e.g., damages, delays, or loss) and submit a publicly available report to Congress, which must include\u00a0DOT's plans to address issues in the report;submit a strategic road map to Congress describing how DOT and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) will establish a research program on the feasibility of main cabin wheelchair restraint systems; andstudy, if DOT first determines doing so would be technically feasible, the economic and financial feasibility of air carriers accommodating passengers with wheelchairs in the main cabin during flight."
