    "text": "This bill revises requirements for a garment to be considered water resistant under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). The HTS sets out the tariff rates and statistical categories for all merchandise imported into the United States.\n\nCurrently, garments that are classified under specified subheadings under chapter 62 of the HTS (e.g., water resistant trousers) must have a water resistance such that, under a head pressure of 600 millimeters, not more than 1.0 gram of water penetrates after two minutes when tested in accordance with a specified test method. Further, the water resistance must be the result of a rubber or plastics application to the outer shell, lining, or inner lining. This bill removes the requirement that the water resistance must be the result of a rubber or plastics application to the outer shell, lining, or inner lining."
