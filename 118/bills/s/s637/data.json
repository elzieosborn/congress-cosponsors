The bill also expands the definition of work to include the performance of services for remuneration.\n\nFurther, the bill replaces the current maximum civil penalty of $11,000 for a violation of the child labor laws with a minimum civil penalty of $5,000 and a maximum of $132,270 (or, in the case of a violation that causes death or serious injury, $25,000 and $601,150, respectively). The civil penalties must be increased annually to match any percent increase in the Consumer Price Index.\n\nRepeat or willful offenders may be fined not more than $50,000 and imprisoned for not more than 1 year."
