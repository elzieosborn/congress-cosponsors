    "text": "Transformational Artificial intelligence to Modernize the Economy against Extreme Weather Act or the TAME Extreme Weather Act\n\nThis bill requires several agencies to develop programs that use artificial intelligence (AI) to support weather forecasting, environmental monitoring, and the energy grid.\n\nFor example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must develop an Earth system reanalysis dataset that provides a record of past weather events so as to support AI weather forecast applications. NOAA must also develop an AI program that analyzes environmental data to support wildfire forecasts.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Agriculture must use AI to analyze data with respect to deforestation, the movement of illegal wood products, and associated changes. The Department of Energy must establish an AI program to optimize energy grids with respect to energy production, stability, and efficiency."
