    "text": "No Mask Mandates Act of 2023\n\nThis bill nullifies existing federal mask mandates and prohibits future actions to require individuals to wear face masks to respond to COVID-19 and other public health emergencies.\n\nSpecifically, the bill nullifies\n\n the executive order issued on January 20, 2021, that addresses the use of face masks in federal buildings and on federal lands; and the emergency order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 29, 2021, that required the use of face masks on public transportation conveyances and in transportation hubs until the order was struck down by a court on April 18, 2022. In addition, the bill prohibits (1) federal agencies or offices from issuing any future orders that mandate face masks or using previously appropriated federal funds to implement or enforce masking requirements to respond to COVID-19, and (2) the Department of Health and Human Services from requiring face masks in response to any declared public health emergency."
