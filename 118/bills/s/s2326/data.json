    "text": "SNAP Nutrition Security Act of 2023\n\nThis bill expands the policy of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to include reducing food insecurity, increasing nutrition security, and improving diet quality for low-income people in the United States. It also\u00a0requires additional\u00a0related reporting by states and the Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nThe bill defines (1) food security as access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life; (2) nutrition security as consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being; and (3) diet quality as the extent to which a set of foods aligns with key recommendations of the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\nUnder current requirements, a state agency that provides nutrition education and obesity prevention services under SNAP must submit an annual report to USDA. The bill requires the report to include (1) state actions taken to enhance the food and nutrition security of SNAP participants, and (2) recommendations regarding administering SNAP in a manner that would enhance state food and nutrition security in the state.\n\nFurther, USDA must submit an annual report to Congress on U.S. food security, nutrition security, and diet quality.\n\nUSDA must use data collected from retail stores participating in SNAP to\u00a0submit a report to Congress at least every four years on food sales in SNAP.\u00a0The report must be made publicly available and include an analysis of the specific food items acquired with SNAP benefits by eligible households.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0"
