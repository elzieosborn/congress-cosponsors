This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct a classified survey to identify each U.S. aircraft shelter in the Indo-Pacific region that is responsible for responding to aggression by China against Taiwan and has not been improved to mitigate damage to aircraft in the event of a missile, aerial drone, or other attack by China.

DOD must submit a classified plan to implement improvements to the shelters as necessary to increase aircraft survivability in the event of attack by China.</summary>
