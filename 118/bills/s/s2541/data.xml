This bill directs the federal crop insurance program to provide for research and development&#160;with respect to the inclusion of covered oilseed crops (i.e.,&#160;rapeseed and canola crops) under double cropping policies. (Double cropping is producing two or more crops for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year.)

The research must evaluate (1) the economic and environmental benefits of incorporating the crops into the policies; and (2) the potential risks associated with incorporating the crops into the policies, specifically with respect to winter-planted covered oilseed crops,&#160;including risks to soil health, biodiversity, and the profitability of farming operations.&#160;(The term policy means an insurance policy, plan of insurance, provision of a policy or plan of insurance, and related materials.)

In awarding contracts, the program may place emphasis on persons and institutions that&#160;have previous research experience with covered oilseed crops and have access to a facility with the capacity to do the research.</summary>
