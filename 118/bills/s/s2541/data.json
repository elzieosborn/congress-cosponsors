    "text": "Mid-South Oilseed Double Cropping Study Act of 2023\n\nThis bill directs the federal crop insurance program to provide for research and development\u00a0with respect to the inclusion of covered oilseed crops (i.e.,\u00a0rapeseed and canola crops) under double cropping policies. (Double cropping is producing two or more crops for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year.)\n\nThe research must evaluate (1) the economic and environmental benefits of incorporating the crops into the policies; and (2) the potential risks associated with incorporating the crops into the policies, specifically with respect to winter-planted covered oilseed crops,\u00a0including risks to soil health, biodiversity, and the profitability of farming operations.\u00a0(The term policy means an insurance policy, plan of insurance, provision of a policy or plan of insurance, and related materials.)\n\nIn awarding contracts, the program may place emphasis on persons and institutions that\u00a0have previous research experience with covered oilseed crops and have access to a facility with the capacity to do the research."
