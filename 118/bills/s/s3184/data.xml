This bill requires certain actions related to preventing terrorism and antisemitism on campus.

Specifically, the bill requires each institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs to include in its annual security report (1) a statement of current campus policies regarding antisemitism; and (2) a statement of current campus policies regarding procedures to prevent and respond to speech, fighting words, or true threats by students, employees, or other individuals related to foreign terrorist organizations.

Additionally, each IHE that receives federal funds must (1) carry out procedures to identify applicants for faculty and staff positions or applicants for student enrollment who have engaged in certain terrorist-related activity; and (2) ensure that federal funds are not used for any activity that urges support for, endorses, espouses, encourages, organizes for, or promotes a foreign terrorist organization or its terrorist activities.

The bill prohibits a student that has been convicted of a criminal offense involving terrorist activity from receiving federal student aid.

The bill requires IHEs that participate in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program to report antisemitic and terrorist-related activity committed by foreign students to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State.

Each IHE receiving federal financial assistance must report information to the Department of Education (ED) on its efforts to prevent and respond to discrimination that is based on an individual's Jewish lineage or ethnic characteristics. ED must annually submit a report to Congress containing this information.</summary>
