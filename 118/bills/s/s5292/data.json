    "text": "This bill allows the Coast Guard to pursue the acquisition of an icebreaker without having to meet certain early-stage acquisition steps typically required for Coast Guard major acquisition programs.\n\nThe bill exempts acquisition or procurement projects from meeting specific requirements to produce information until the first phase of the initial acquisition or procurement is complete and initial operating capacity is achieved. Specifically, the project is exempt from requirements that the Coast Guard\n\nclearly define the operational requirements for the project or program;develop an acquisition project or program baseline; andsubmit to Congress materials on the project, including an acquisition program baseline showing costs and schedule information.If the Coast Guard provides a briefing to Congress within 30 days of the bill's enactment that includes a detailed cost estimate for an icebreaker, then the project is also exempt from additional requirements until the first phase of the initial acquisition or procurement is complete and initial operating capacity is achieved. Specifically, the project is exempt from requirements that the Coast Guard produce documents that include (1)\u00a0an approved test and evaluation master plan, and (2) a life cycle cost estimate."
