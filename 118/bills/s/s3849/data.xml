This bill requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to support U.S. involvement in the development of standards for artificial intelligence (AI) through briefings, pilot programs, and other activities.

Specifically, NIST must (1) brief Congress on opportunities for the federal government to participate in the process for developing technical standards for AI, (2) establish a web portal to inform U.S. industries and federal agencies of international efforts and opportunities to develop such standards, and (3) establish a pilot program and award associated grants to support stakeholder meetings in the&#160;U.S. on developing such standards.&#160;</summary>
