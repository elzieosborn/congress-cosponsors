(Under the agreement, Amtrak committed to complying with the ADA and making intercity rail stations accessible.)\n\nAmtrak must also include a status report on ADA compliance at Amtrak-served stations (based on a station assessment by Amtrak or the party responsible for ADA compliance). For those Amtrak-served stations where Amtrak is not responsible for ADA compliance, Amtrak must include in the report information on the responsible party.\u00a0Amtrak may meet these requirements by demonstrating that Amtrak took reasonable measures to obtain cooperation from responsible entities.\n\nFurther, Amtrak must annually submit\u00a0the action plan and status report while the settlement agreement is in effect and\u00a0every five years once the agreement\u00a0is no longer in effect."
