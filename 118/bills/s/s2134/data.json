    "text": "Smoke Exposure Crop Insurance Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires the federal crop insurance program (FCIP) to provide for the research and development of a policy to insure wine grapes (including wine grapes produced in California, Oregon, and Washington) against losses due to wildfire smoke exposure. (The term policy means an insurance policy, plan of insurance, provision of a policy or plan of insurance, and related materials.) The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, the agency that finances FCIP operations, must make any resulting policy available that meets specified FCIP requirements.\n\nThe FCIP must also submit a report to Congress on the research and any resulting policy. The report must include an evaluation of the feasibility of a policy that allows producers to claim an indemnity through post-harvest, post-vinification testing if such testing demonstrates smoke damage that was not detectable prior to harvest."
