This bill modifies dental coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Specifically, the bill prohibits lifetime or annual limits on CHIP dental coverage. It also requires states to offer dental-only supplemental coverage under CHIP to children who have other health insurance but are otherwise eligible for CHIP (i.e., wraparound coverage); such coverage is currently at the option of the state.</summary>
