This bill provides eligibility for enrollment in schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) to dependents of certain deceased members of the Armed Forces.

Specifically, the bill provides eligibility to dependents of members of the Armed Forces who died while serving on active duty or active Guard and Reserve duty. Such dependents are eligible to enroll in DODEA schools regardless of (1) whether the dependent was enrolled on the date of the death of the member, or (2) the proximity of the school to the location where the dependent resided on the date of the death.

Enrollment of such dependents must be on a tuition-free and space-available basis.</summary>
