    "text": "Keep China Out of Solar Energy Act of 2023\n\nThis bill prohibits federal procurement of solar panels manufactured or assembled in China.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop standards and guidelines for executive agencies to prohibit (1) federal funds from being awarded for the procurement of solar panels that are manufactured or assembled by any entity domiciled in China or subject to influence or control by the government of China or the Chinese Communist Party, and (2) the use of government-issued purchase cards to purchase solar panels that are manufactured or assembled by any such entity.\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the prohibition with respect to federal contracts and subcontracts.\n\nThe bill sets forth provisions regarding waivers, quarterly reports by the OMB to Congress, and a report by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe OMB shall seek to enter into a contract with a federally funded research and development center under which the center will study (1) the current and future domestic market of solar panel production, (2) the ability of the solar panel domestic market to keep pace with technological advancements across the industry, and (3) the current global supply chain and workforce involved with solar panel production."
