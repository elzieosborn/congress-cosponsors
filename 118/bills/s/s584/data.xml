  <summary date="2024-01-18T16:27:30Z" status="Introduced in Senate">North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2023

This bill reauthorizes through FY2028 various activities to promote human rights in North Korea. These activities include (1) providing grants to nonprofit organizations to promote human rights, democracy, rule of law, and the development of a market economy in North Korea; (2) increasing the availability of sources of information inside North Korea that are not controlled by North Korea's government; and (3) supporting organizations that provide humanitarian assistance to North Koreans who are outside of North Korea without the permission of North Korea's government.

Additionally, the bill authorizes the President to impose certain sanctions, including visa- and property-blocking sanctions, on any person (an individual or entity) that knowingly forced the repatriation of North Korean refugees to North Korea.</summary>
