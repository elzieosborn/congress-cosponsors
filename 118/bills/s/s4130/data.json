Under the pilot program, the military departments must establish partnerships with 12 child care providers to (1) increase the capacity of the providers, (2) improve early child care workforce development, and (3) increase recruitment and retention of employees for eligible child care providers.\n\nChild care providers under the program may not\u00a0reduce early child care slots for nonmilitary families after entering into the partnership or\u00a0enter into the construction of new child care facilities.\n\nDOD must direct the military departments to provide annual briefings to Congress on the implementation of the pilot program.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must submit an interim and a final report on the progress and results of the pilot program."
