This bill prohibits an employer from terminating an employee's health insurance coverage during certain labor disputes.

Specifically, the bill prohibits an employer from terminating or altering the employer-provided health insurance coverage of an employee during the period that the employer is taking action to lock out, suspend, or otherwise withhold employment from the employee in order to influence the position of such employee or the representative of such employee in collective bargaining prior to a strike. It also prohibits an employer from terminating or altering such coverage during the period that an employee is engaged in a lawful strike.

The bill establishes civil penalties for each violation of the prohibitions under this bill.</summary>
