This bill eliminates a limitation on the amount of leave that spouses working for the same employer may access under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).

Under current law, an eligible individual may access up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave per year, but spouses with the same employer are required to share a total of 12 weeks of FMLA leave per year if the leave is taken for the birth of a child, the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care, or to care for a parent with a serious health condition. The bill repeals this limitation, making each spouse eligible for up to 12 weeks of leave per year in these situations.
