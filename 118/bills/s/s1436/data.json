Additionally, the VA may collaborate with one or more organizations to manage the use of VA land for homeless veterans for living and sleeping.\n\nThe bill extends the waiver for occupancy rate requirements through FY2024 for state homes for purposes of receiving per diem payments from the VA.\n\nThe bill authorizes the VA to continue to provide to state homes medicines, personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and any other equipment, supplies, and assistance available to the VA."
