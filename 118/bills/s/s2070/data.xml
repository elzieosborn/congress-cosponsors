This bill prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from modifying its policy relating to anesthesia care in a manner that would provide any medical professional other than a physician anesthesiologist with full practice authority for the furnishment of anesthesia care to veterans under VA health care laws. The VA is also prohibited from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the provisions relating to anesthesia care of the proposed rule titled Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (81 Fed. Reg. 33155), or any substantially similar rule.</summary>
