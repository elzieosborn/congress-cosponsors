(Under this program, USDA\u00a0provides technical assistance to rural water systems that serve areas with populations of 10,000 or fewer people and are experiencing day-to-day operational, financial, or managerial issues.)\n\nSpecifically, the cybersecurity circuit rider program must provide technical assistance to rural water or wastewater systems to\n\nprovide rapid assessments of the system's current ability or inability to respond to cybersecurity\u00a0threats and\u00a0protect cyber infrastructure,develop reasonable protocols to enhance\u00a0cybersecurity protection,provide assistance to address inadequate cyber protection plans, anddocument a system's current state of water supply cyber protection.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
