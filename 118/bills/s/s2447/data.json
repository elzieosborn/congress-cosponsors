The program supports telemedicine and distance learning services in rural areas through telecommunications, computer networks, and other advanced technology by students, teachers, medical professionals, and residents of rural areas.\n\nThe bill expands the scope of the program to specifically allow the use of program funds for operational expenses associated with telemedicine programs. It also allows the USDA to waive matching fund requirements in certain circumstances and requires USDA to set aside a specific amount of funding allotments for programs that focus on substance use disorder treatment or mental health services."
