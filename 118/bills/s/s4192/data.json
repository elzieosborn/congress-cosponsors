    "text": "We Can't Wait Act of 2024\n\nThis bill permits Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries to elect expedited payment of benefits in exchange for a reduction in the amount of their monthly benefit.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill allows individuals to elect to receive SSDI benefits beginning the month after the onset of disability. Under current law, individuals generally must wait five months after the onset of disability to begin receiving SSDI benefits.\n\nIndividuals who opt to receive expedited payment during the first three years the bill is in effect must accept a 6.1% reduction in monthly benefits. At the three-year point and every five years thereafter, the Social Security Administration (SSA) must recalculate the applicable percentage to ensure no negative fiscal impact to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Changes to the designated percentage may not impact the benefit amount received by existing beneficiaries.\u00a0\n\nSSA must make available an online tool for calculating the impact of electing to receive benefits during the waiting period on an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SSDI benefit."
