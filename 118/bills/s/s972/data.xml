The bill provides additional funding for grants for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law enforcement officers under the Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program.

The bill also requires law enforcement agencies that use the funds to hire or rehire a law enforcement officer to (1) perform a background check on the law enforcement officer, and (2) ensure that the law enforcement officer undergoes a psychological evaluation.</summary>
