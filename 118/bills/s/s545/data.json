    "text": "Air Carrier Access Amendments Act of 2023\n\nThis bill expands protections for airline passengers with disabilities and requires air carriers to meet certain minimum accessibility standards.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) must prescribe regulations setting minimum accessibility standards for new and existing aircraft, airport facilities, websites, and kiosks. The accessibility standards must address topics including\n\n boarding and deplaning equipment, including ensuring individuals can board and deplane an aircraft from their personal assistive devices (e.g., wheelchairs); seating accommodations; lavatories; visually accessible announcements; and proper stowage of assistive devices in the cargo hold to prevent damage. Existing aircraft have five years from the effective date of the regulations to comply with the standards. DOT must assess civil penalties against an air carrier for violations of these provisions and refer patterns of discrimination to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nDOT must also ensure that passengers with disabilities may (1) file a complaint with the agency in response to disability-related discrimination, and (2) receive assistance through a toll-free hotline or other electronic method.\n\nFurther, the bill authorizes DOJ and aggrieved passengers to bring civil actions for discrimination against an air carrier."
