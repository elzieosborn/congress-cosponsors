(Neglected diseases of poverty are chronic and disabling diseases that are caused by parasites, bacteria, and other pathogens and that primarily impact those living in extreme poverty, such as Chagas disease or hookworm infection.)\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Health and Human Services must (1) establish an interagency task force to provide recommendations for addressing the diseases, (2) increase awareness among health care providers and the public about the diseases, and (3) support research into affordable vaccines and other therapeutics for the diseases.\n\nAdditionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must provide grants to (1) states to implement surveillance systems for the diseases; and (2) federally qualified health centers to implement guidelines for the diagnosis, control, and treatment of the diseases.\n\nThe bill also authorizes one or more centers of excellence for researching and developing methods to diagnose, prevent, control, and treat the diseases."
