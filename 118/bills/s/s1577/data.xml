This bill requires federal agencies to designate emerging technology leads (i.e., individuals to give advice on the responsible use of emerging technologies, provide expertise, collaborate with interagency coordinating bodies, and provide input for procurement policies).

The President, within 180 days of this bill's enactment, must (1) inform Congress of each agency for which a lead has been appointed or designated, and (2) provide to Congress a description of the authorities and responsibilities of such leads.</summary>
