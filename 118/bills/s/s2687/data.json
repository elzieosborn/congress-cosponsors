Specifically, these mortgages must be secured by real property and the priority of the mortgage lien must be insured by a title insurance company that is licensed and authorized to do business in the appropriate state, territory, or district.\n\nThe bill also prohibits Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from implementing any new program without the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), in addition to the approval of the Department of the Treasury as under current law. Approval from both is also required for any new activity, product, or type of risk.\n\nFHFA must appear before Congress on a semiannual basis regarding new programs, activities, products, or types of risk. \u00a0"
