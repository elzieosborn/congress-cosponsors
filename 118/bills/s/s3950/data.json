    "text": "Delivering Unified Access to Lifesaving Services Act of 2024 or the DUALS Act of 2024\n\nThis bill creates a program to provide integrated care for individuals who are fully eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (i.e., dual-eligible individuals).\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must develop a set of models for states to provide integrated care coordination for dual-eligible individuals; states must choose one of these models and implement the model within four years of their selection. Benefits must include clinical health services, behavioral health services, and long-term services and supports. Care coordination plans must be based on individualized health risk assessments and involve interdisciplinary health care teams. Each individual must be assigned a care coordinator to help the individual with respect to benefits and health care decisions.\u00a0\n\nThe bill provides funds for states and the CMS to implement this program. It also provides funds for outreach and other activities to raise awareness about the program.\n\nThe bill also modifies Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), including by allowing those under age 55 to enroll in PACE if they are eligible for Medicare. (PACE is a program under Medicare and Medicaid that provides in-home and community services for certain individuals as an alternative to nursing home care.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
