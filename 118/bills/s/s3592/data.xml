This bill limits the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over entities that are regulated by a state insurance regulator. Specifically, the bureau is prohibited from pursuing enforcement against any person regulated by a state insurance regulator and offers a consumer financial product or service, to the extent that the person is engaged in the business of insurance. If a person engaged in the business of insurance is regulated by a state insurance regulator but is otherwise subject to the bureau's enforcement authority, the bureau must construe its authority narrowly.</summary>
