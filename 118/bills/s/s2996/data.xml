This bill reauthorizes through FY2028 and revises the&#160;Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program (RMAP).&#160;This Department of Agriculture program provides loans to eligible microenterprise development organizations to capitalize revolving loan funds that provide loans to qualified rural microenterprises.&#160;

The bill increases the amount a rural microenterprise may borrow to up to $75,000 (from up to $50,000).

The bill also increases the maximum allowable federal cost share to 100% (from 75%). The bill further specifies that a RMAP project loan may not be used to cover more than 50% of any demolition, construction, or related costs of real estate improvements.</summary>
