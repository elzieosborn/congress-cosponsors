    "text": "Strengthening Federal Reserve System Accountability Act of 2023 \n\n This bill revises director qualifications and elections for the boards of federal reserve banks and makes other changes to transparency and ethics requirements. (There are 12 federal reserve banks each overseen by a 9-member board of directors. Each board is comprised of 3 directors from 3 statutorily defined classes: A, B, and C.)\n\nThe bill limits the eligibility for Class A directors to those who represent banks with less than $50 billion in assets. Further, Class B directors must be selected by Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, rather than by the banks as under current law. Individuals who served as bank executives, directors, or employees in the preceding five years are prohibited from serving as Class B directors. No director is allowed to serve more than 2 full terms. The bill requires the board to publish specified details regarding director selection and candidacy.\n\nThe bill also prohibits bank directors from participating in certain bank supervision activities, including the selection of supervisory bank officers.\n\nFinally, the bill requires directors, presidents, and vice presidents to comply with specified ethics rules regarding investment and trading activity."
