This bill expands eligibility for specified Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits (e.g., medical and dental care) to certain veterans of the armed forces of South Korea who served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, or during a time period determined by the VA.

The bill authorizes the VA to furnish such benefits under an existing law, which requires (1) a request by South Korea, and (2) a reciprocity agreement that provides for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the VA for the provision of care.</summary>
