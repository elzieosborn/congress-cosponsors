    "text": "Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act\n\nThis bill expands prohibitions against manipulating fuel markets, establishes a body within the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to monitor fuel markets to ensure competitiveness, and addresses related issues.\n\nProhibitions against the manipulation of wholesale fuel markets or reporting false (or misleading) information shall apply to actions related to crude oil and transportation fuel (defined in this bill to include gasoline, distillate fuels, jet fuel, aviation gasoline, and biofuel). Currently, such prohibitions only apply to crude oil, gasoline, and petroleum distillates.\n\nThe bill further expands the prohibition on reporting false information to include such information that (1) concerns the supply of, operational actions related to, or output related to crude oil or transportation fuel; or (2) is not required to be reported by law.\n\nFurthermore, the bill establishes within the FTC the Transportation Fuel Monitoring and Enforcement Unit. The unit must continuously and comprehensively collect and analyze fuel market data to support competitive market practices, identify market manipulation and other unfair methods of competition, and facilitate enforcement of competition-related statutes.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration within the Department of Energy must collect data to facilitate transparent and competitive transportation fuel markets, determine adherence to sanctions, and protect consumers."
