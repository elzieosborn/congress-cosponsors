This bill addresses various issues related to border security and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Under this bill, DHS employees may receive danger pay while stationed in a foreign area while that area is experiencing certain conditions, such as civil war, that threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the employee. The danger pay may be for up to 35% of the employee's basic pay.

Furthermore, DHS may waive reimbursement for the salaries of DHS employees providing training to foreign-vetted law enforcement or national security units under an agreement with the Department of Defense.

The bill also authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide air and marine support to foreign governments for certain operations, such as an operation to deter illegal drugs from entering the United States.

The bill also makes it a crime to destroy or significantly damage physical or electronic devices (e.g., fences or cameras) used by the federal government to control a U.S. international border with the intent to achieve certain goals relating to securing financial gain and breaking federal laws. Similarly, it shall be a crime to knowingly track, monitor, or transmit the activities of federal, state, or local law enforcement officers with the intent to achieve such goals.

The crimes established by this bill shall be punishable by fines, imprisonment of up to five years, or both.</summary>
