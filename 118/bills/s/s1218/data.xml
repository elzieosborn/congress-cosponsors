This bill caps the price of drugs and biologics at the average price among certain countries.

Specifically, the retail list price of a drug or biologic in the United States may not exceed the average retail list price among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must calculate the average price in these countries based on data that is submitted by manufacturers directly to HHS and on publicly filed materials from manufacturers.

Manufacturers who violate the bill's price cap are subject to civil penalties.</summary>
