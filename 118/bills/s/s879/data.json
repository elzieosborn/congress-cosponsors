    "text": "Energy Freedom Act\n\nThis bill establishes requirements to provide for domestic energy production.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes deadlines to expedite the review of permits and other authorizations for natural gas transmission projects, natural gas interstate pipelines, and the exportation of natural gas. The bill also requires a minimum number of annual sales of leases on federal lands and waters for oil and gas development. It also requires sales of leases of federal land for wind, solar, and geothermal development.\n\nThe President and federal agencies must obtain the approval of Congress before (1) declaring a moratorium on the leasing of federal lands or waters for the drilling, mining, or collection of oil, gas, or coal; (2) prohibiting or substantially delaying certain new energy leases, mineral leases, or permits on federal lands; and (3) withdrawing certain federal lands from mineral and geothermal leasing activities. Further, the bill eliminates the requirement for certain cross-border energy projects to obtain presidential approval.\n\nIn addition, the bill allows the Department of the Interior to grant licenses for the exploration and mining of hardrock minerals on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n\nFinally, the bill reinstates specified rules concerning waters of the United States, oil and gas, civil penalties, environmental review, and discharge and dredged materials."
