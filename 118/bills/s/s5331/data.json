    "text": "Humanitarian Tech Corps Act\n\nThis bill establishes a grant program for colleges and universities to offer scholarships to students studying computer science, technology, and related topics, and who will seek post-graduate employment with a federal humanitarian agency or partner organization. Scholarships shall cover tuition and fees for up to four years of a degree program and provide a separate living stipend. The National Science Foundation (NSF) shall administer the grant program in coordination with the Office of Personnel Management and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nAs a condition of the scholarship, recipients who have completed their degree program must work at USAID, another federal humanitarian agency, or an approved non-governmental partner to USAID for a period at least equal to the duration of the scholarship. If a scholarship recipient fails to complete their degree or maintain the required post-graduation employment, the recipient shall repay some or all of the scholarship funds. Following completion of the employment obligation, a recipient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal appointment may be converted to a career or term appointment."
