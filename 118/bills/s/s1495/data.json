    "text": "Heat pump Energy Assistance and Training Act or the HEAT Act\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish an industrial heat\u00a0pump program. Among other things, the program must provide technical support to farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses on (1) the use of industrial heat pumps, and (2) the availability of federal programs to assist in the adoption to using industrial heat pumps. An industrial heat pump is a vapor compression device that transforms low grade production waste heat by increasing the temperature of air or process fluid, such as water, to meet the heating needs of agricultural, industrial, or commercial processes.\n\nThe bill also amends USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) to specifically include the purchase and installation of industrial heat pumps. Under REAP, USDA provides (1) loan guarantees and grants to agricultural producers and rural small businesses to purchase renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements, and (2) loan guarantees to agricultural producers to purchase and install energy efficient equipment and systems for agricultural production and processing.\n\nUSDA must submit an annual report to Congress describing progress made in building awareness, creating materials, and providing support for farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses under the bill.\u00a0"
