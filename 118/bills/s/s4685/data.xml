This bill allows a new tax credit through 2027 for truck fleet retreaded tires. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the lesser of 30% of the basis of each qualified retreaded tire or the amount incurred by a taxpayer to purchase such tires not to exceed $30 per tire.&#160;

A qualified retreaded tire is a retreaded truck tire that is retreaded and purchased in the United States.&#160;

The bill requires agency heads to purchase retreadable tires of certain sizes, load ranges, and desired tread designation instead of new non retreadable tires.&#160;</summary>
