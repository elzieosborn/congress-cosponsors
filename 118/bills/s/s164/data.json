The bill also prohibits (1) the incidence rate of COVID-19 in a geographic area from being considered in such decisions, and (2) the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network from establishing standards that incorporate any of these factors.\n\nAdditionally, as a condition of Medicare and Medicaid participation, health care providers, with specified exceptions (e.g., skilled nursing facilities), may not deny services to individuals based on COVID-19 vaccination status."
