This bill specifies that funds that support the instructional needs of elementary and secondary students from low-income families (i.e., Title I funds) may be used for arts and music programs.

First, the bill specifies that schools operating school-wide programs may include descriptions related to arts and music education in their comprehensive plans. Such a plan may include a description of (1) how sequential, standards-based arts education taught by certified educators and providers meet the challenging state academic standards, and (2) how sequential, standards-based music education taught by certified educators align with the challenging state academic standards.

Second, the bill specifies that schools operating targeted assistance programs may use funds for arts and music programs that address the academic needs of students. This assistance may include providing support for certified educators, professional development, supplies, instruments, and other expenses.</summary>
