This bill establishes specialized pay for federal wildland firefighters.

Specifically, the bill provides for a specialized pay schedule for wildland firefighters in the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. The specialized pay schedule is based on the General Schedule, increased by a specified percentage depending on the position grade (the higher the grade, the lower the percentage adjustment).

The bill also provides for specialized premium pay for wildland firefighters who respond to certain prolonged fire incidents (i.e., those that are not contained within 36 hours). It also provides for paid rest and recuperation leave in conjunction with such responses.</summary>
