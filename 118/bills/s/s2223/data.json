Currently, only fresh fruits and vegetables are covered under the program. (This program supports projects that demonstrate and evaluate the impact of fruit and vegetable prescriptions on\u00a0increasing procurement and consumption of fruits and vegetables, reducing individual and household food insecurity, and reducing healthcare usage and associated costs.)\u00a0"
