  <summary date="2024-09-18T14:42:05Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Supporting all Healthy Options when Purchasing Produce Act of 2023 or the SHOPP Act&#160;of 2023

This bill modifies the&#160;Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program&#160;(GusNIP), which provides grants for projects that provide incentives for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants to purchase fruits and vegetables.&#160;

Specifically, the bill amends GusNIP to require the Department of Agriculture to give priority to projects that&#160;increase year-round availability of nutrition incentives by offering fresh frozen fruits or vegetables in the program.

The bill also amends the GusNIP Produce Prescription Program to include fresh frozen fruits and vegetables, as well as fresh and fresh frozen legumes. Currently, only fresh fruits and vegetables are covered under the program. (This program supports projects that demonstrate and evaluate the impact of fruit and vegetable prescriptions on&#160;increasing procurement and consumption of fruits and vegetables, reducing individual and household food insecurity, and reducing healthcare usage and associated costs.)&#160;</summary>
