This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants on a competitive basis for upgrading the facilities of pregnancy-help organizations. The bill defines these as organizations that provide services to individuals with unintended pregnancies with the intent of encouraging the individuals to give birth; the definition in the bill excludes, however, organizations that perform or refer for abortions (or affiliates of those organizations).

Facility upgrades include installing security systems and making the facilities accessible to people with disabilities.

The bill prohibits the use of grant funds for abortion-related services.</summary>
