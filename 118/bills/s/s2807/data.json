(A kelp forest is a dense grouping of large brown algae which also serves as a habitat for marine life.)\n\nEligible projects include those that address the greatest relative regional declines in kelp forest ecosystems, focus on kelp forest seeding and connectivity, or integrate Indigenous knowledge and cultural practices into the restoration and monitoring of kelp forest ecosystems.\n\nThe bill specifies that members of the fishing industry, institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, Indian tribes, state agencies, and local governments are eligible to receive grants.\n\nThe bill prohibits a grant\u00a0from exceeding 85% of the total project cost. However, NOAA may waive this restriction in limited circumstances.\n\n\u00a0"
