  <summary date="2023-11-07T11:31:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">AI Shield for Kids Act or the ASK Act

This bill restricts a minor's access to programs, services, applications, or other products that contain any artificial intelligence (AI) features, such as chat features. (Generally, AI refers to computerized systems that work and react in ways commonly thought to require human intelligence, such as certain systems that solve complex problems in real-world situations.)

Specifically, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must issue rules to prohibit any entity (such as a social media company) from offering products with AI features to a minor without the consent of the minor's parent or guardian. The consent may be revoked at any time, and the entity may not charge a fee for removing an AI feature if a parent or guardian revokes consent. The FCC must consult with the Federal Trade Commission on the rules.</summary>
