(Currently, the center must focus on applied research and training on the durability and maintainability of advanced materials in transport airframe structures.) The center must also conduct research and development into aircraft structure crashworthiness and passenger safety, as well as address safe and accessible air travel of individuals with a disability, including materials required to facilitate safe wheelchair restraint systems on commercial aircraft.\n\nThe center's responsibilities must also include establishing criteria for the safe movement of all passengers, including individuals with a disability and individuals using their personal wheelchairs in flight, that takes into account the modeling, engineering, testing, operating, and training issues significant to all passengers and relevant stakeholders.\u00a0\u00a0"
