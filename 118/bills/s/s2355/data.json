    "text": "Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement and Enforcement Act of 2023\n\nThis bill applies sanctions compliance requirements and\u00a0anti-money laundering requirements to decentralized finance services. Decentralized finance services are applications that facilitate peer-to-peer digital asset financial transactions using distributed ledger (i.e., blockchain) technology.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires certain U.S. persons to comply with sanctions obligations if a violation of sanctions is committed through the use of a digital asset protocol. U.S. persons subject to these requirements are digital transaction facilitators and, in certain circumstances, digital asset protocol backers.\n\nFurther, digital asset transaction facilitators and digital asset protocol backers are subject to reporting requirements designed to prevent money laundering, including suspicious transaction reporting.\u00a0\n\nFinally, virtual currency kiosks (i.e., digital asset kiosks) must verify and record the identities of the counterparties to a transfer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0"
