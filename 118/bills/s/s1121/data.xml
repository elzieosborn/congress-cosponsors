  <summary date="2023-04-28T10:40:14Z" status="Introduced in Senate">DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act

This bill restricts funding to an institution of higher education (IHE) that has a relationship with a Chinese entity of concern or Confucius Institute. A Confucius Institute is a cultural institute directly or indirectly funded by the Chinese government.

Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must ensure that an IHE that has awarded a contract to, entered into an agreement with, or received an in-kind donation or gift from a Chinese entity of concern or Confucius Institute is ineligible to receive any funds from DHS, unless the IHE terminates the relationship. The IHE may regain eligibility for these funds upon termination of the relationship.</summary>
