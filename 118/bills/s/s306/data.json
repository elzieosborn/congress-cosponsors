It also establishes and provides funding for a settlement trust fund.\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes, ratifies, and confirms a specified water rights settlement agreement entered into by the tribe, the South Tule Independent Ditch Company, and the Tule River Association, thus satisfying claims to water rights in California.\n\nAdditionally, the bill outlines the tribe's water rights, including the right to divert and use 5,828 acre-feet of water per year from the South Fork Tule River.\n\nNext, the bill establishes and provides funding for the Tule River Indian Tribe Settlement Trust Fund. Amounts deposited in this trust fund shall be made available to the tribe for water development projects.\n\nThe bill also transfers specified lands, including a portion of federal lands in the Sequoia National Forest, into trust for the benefit of the tribe.\n\nThe bill outlines waivers, releases, and retentions of claims by the tribe and the United States under the settlement agreement."
