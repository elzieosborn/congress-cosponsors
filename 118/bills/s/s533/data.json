The bill also prohibits the issuance of new special certificates that allow payment of subminimum wages to people with disabilities and phases out existing certificates over a five-year period.\n\nThe bill directs Labor's Office of Disability Employment to award grants to provide technical assistance and other strategic support to employers transitioning from special certificates to competitive integrated employment for people with disabilities.\n\nLabor must contract with a nonprofit entity to conduct an evaluation of the impact of these transitions."
