This bill addresses employment standards for people with disabilities.

The bill directs the Department of Labor to award grants to states and certain eligible entities to assist them in transforming their business and program models to support people with disabilities by

 providing competitive integrated employment, assisting such individuals in finding and retaining work in such employment, providing integrated employment and integrated community participation and wraparound services for such individuals, and ensuring that such services comply with federal regulations for individuals receiving home and community-based services. The bill also prohibits the issuance of new special certificates that allow payment of subminimum wages to people with disabilities and phases out existing certificates over a five-year period.

The bill directs Labor's Office of Disability Employment to award grants to provide technical assistance and other strategic support to employers transitioning from special certificates to competitive integrated employment for people with disabilities.

Labor must contract with a nonprofit entity to conduct an evaluation of the impact of these transitions.</summary>
