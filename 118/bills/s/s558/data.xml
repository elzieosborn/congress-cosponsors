This bill grants Executive Order 13950 the force and effect of law, except with respect to elementary schools, secondary schools, or institutions of higher education. That order prohibits federal agencies and contractors from advancing specified policies or training related to race or sex.

The bill further prohibits the allocation of federal funds to an elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education that compels teachers or students to affirm certain race-based theories.</summary>
