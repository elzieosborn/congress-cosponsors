Specifically, the co-payment amount may not exceed the amount of a co-payment that would be charged under the TRICARE program for an outpatient visit for primary care services.\n\nDuring the one-year period beginning after this bill is enacted, DOD may not increase the co-payment amount charged to a covered individual above the amount that would have been charged in FY2021\u00a0for any service (1) furnished by a specialty care provider under the TRICARE program, and (2) that is not an outpatient visit for\u00a0mental or behavioral health care.\u00a0"
