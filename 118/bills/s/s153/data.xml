  <summary date="2023-02-14T22:10:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act

This bill revises trade, finance, and tax provisions with respect to China.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Commerce to prohibit the export of certain U.S. technology and intellectual property to China, and it places a shareholder cap on Chinese investments in certain U.S. entities.

The bill prohibits federal agencies from using or procuring telecommunications equipment or services from Huawei Technologies Company, ZTE Corporation, or any other&#160;entity reasonably believed to be owned or controlled by China.

Further, the bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to list certain Chinese products that receive support pursuant to China's Made in China 2025 policy. The bill expedites the countervailing duty process (i.e., the imposition of duties to offset a subsidy by a foreign government) for products on this list.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to (1) repeal certain reduced withholding rates for residents of China, and (2) provide for the taxation of income received by China on certain U.S. investments.</summary>
