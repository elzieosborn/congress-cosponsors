This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to conduct patient-focused listening sessions on how to improve the Medicare prescription drug benefit.

Specifically, the CMS must conduct at least one listening session with beneficiaries, health care providers, and other stakeholders about ways to improve the Medicare prescription drug benefit, including with respect to the information, tools, and mechanisms available to beneficiaries for navigating&#160;coverage options and requirements. The CMS must consider potential regulatory changes in light of these sessions.</summary>
