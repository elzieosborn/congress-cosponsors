This bill bars foreign government officials who knowingly undermined elections from entering the United States.

Specifically, the prohibition applies to any non-U.S. citizen who, while serving as a government official of a foreign country, knowingly took significant action to inhibit (or attempt to inhibit) the lawful democratic transition of power or lawful functioning democratic processes in that foreign country.

The Department of State may waive this prohibition if the waiver is in the national interest of the United States.</summary>
