    "text": "State Executive Authority for Seasonal Occupations Needing Additional Labor Act or the SEASONAL Act\n\nThis bill authorizes additional H-2B (temporary nonagricultural worker) visas to be issued to employers in a\u00a0state with unmet labor needs. (H-2B visas are subject to an annual numerical cap.)\n\nUnder the bill, a state may request\u00a0a particular number of H-2B visas if\u00a0(1) employers have requested visas in excess of the numerical cap for that fiscal year, and (2)\u00a0a state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has been 3.5% or less (in 9 of the most recent 12 quarters). The state\u00a0must also certify that (1) there is a persistent, unmet need for labor within the state, an occupational category, or an Economic Development District; and (2) the additional H-2B visas will not displace existing members of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workforce or negatively affect average wages.\u00a0\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must issue the additional H-2B visas upon receiving a request that complies with this bill's requirements, to the extent that the receiving employers meet all the applicable requirements for such visas.\n\n Additionally, the bill requires DHS and the Department of Labor to annually\u00a0report to Congress specified data about the bill's implementation, including the number of additional visas issued to each state.\n\nThe bill sunsets four years after its enactment."
