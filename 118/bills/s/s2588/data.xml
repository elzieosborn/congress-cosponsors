conduct a study regarding changes in soil health and soil organic carbon levels as a result of the adopted practices;develop ranking and scoring criteria under the program that prioritize soil health practices that score highest in soil carbon sequestration on eligible land;create a soil organic carbon conservation activity plan under the program to measure and monitor sequestration and mitigation improvement levels from the practices;provide for streamlined and coordinated procedures for the program and the Conservation Stewardship Program, including for contracting, conservation planning, conservation practices, and related administrative procedures; andestablish a program to provide grants to land-grant colleges and universities to conduct research relating to soil health and carbon science and to&#160;conduct research relating to soil health and carbon science at its agricultural research stations.&#160;</summary>
