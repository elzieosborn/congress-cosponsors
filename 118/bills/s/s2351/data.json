Under current Federal Aviation Administration policy, this requirement applies to any tax on aviation fuel, regardless of whether the tax is imposed only on aviation fuel or is imposed on other products as well as aviation fuel.\n\nThis bill specifies that the AIP grant requirements apply only to state and local excise taxes on aviation fuel. The requirements do not apply to (1) state or local general sales taxes, or (2) state or local generally applicable sales taxes."
