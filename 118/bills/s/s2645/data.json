It also requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to (1) establish a heat health information system to improve forecasts of extreme heat, and (2) contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study policy, data, and research gaps relating to extreme heat.\u00a0\n\nNOAA may also, in coordination with the interagency committee, award financial assistance to nonprofits, academic institutions, and state, local, and tribal governments to support the ability of communities to mitigate the health effects of extreme heat (e.g., building modifications and educational campaigns)."
