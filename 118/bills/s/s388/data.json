Children who are not yet required to attend school may participate in the program regardless of family income, disability status, citizenship status, or employment of a family member.\n\nUnder the program, HHS must support sponsors (e.g., states, local governments, tribal organizations, and nonprofit community organizations) that provide child care and early learning\u00a0services\u00a0for families.\n\nFamilies must pay a\u00a0subsidized\u00a0fee, based on their income,\u00a0for the services. The fees are waived for children from\u00a0families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line. The fees are capped at\u00a07% of\u00a0a family's\u00a0income regardless of the family's income level."
