  <summary date="2023-07-05T14:43:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Syria Detainee and Displaced Persons Act

This bill renews a requirement for an executive branch official to coordinate the U.S. government response to issues related to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) members in the custody of Syrian Democratic Forces. The bill also modifies aspects of this coordinator position, such as by expanding the scope to include issues concerning relevant displaced individuals who are not ISIS members.

Specifically, the bill renews the requirement to have this coordinator position through January 31, 2025. Under current law, this requirement expired on January 31, 2021.

In addition, the Department of State must submit to Congress an interagency strategy relating to camps for displaced individuals in Syria, including methods to (1) prevent violent extremism in such camps, and (2) return and reintegrate displaced Syrian and Iraqi women and children into their communities of origin.</summary>
