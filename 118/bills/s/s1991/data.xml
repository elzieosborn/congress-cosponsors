This bill reauthorizes through FY2028 the Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support Grant Program and the Recovery Housing Program.

The bill also specifies that the data used to determine which states to prioritize for grants (e.g., overdose mortality rates and unemployment rates) must be based on the five-year period immediately preceding the grant cycle. It also allows grants under the Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support Grant Program to be used for transportation services to and from the individual's work, training, or treatment or recovery services.

The Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support Grant Program supports the ability of&#160;individuals who are in substance-use disorder treatment and recovery to live independently and participate in the workforce. The Recovery Housing Program supports the provision of transitional housing for those who are in recovery from a substance-use disorder for up to two years or until the individual finds permanent housing, whichever is earlier.&#160;
