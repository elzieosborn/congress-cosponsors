  <summary date="2024-01-18T21:57:14Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Stephanie Tubbs Jones Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2023

This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand research on, and take other actions to address, uterine fibroids. These are muscular tumors that grow in the wall of the uterus and may cause pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, and reproductive issues.

In coordination with the National Institutes of Health and appropriate federal agencies, HHS must undertake research activities on uterine fibroids.

In addition, HHS must establish a database of services furnished to individuals diagnosed with uterine fibroids under Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program and must develop a report on federal and state expenditures for such services.

Additionally, HHS must disseminate information on uterine fibroids to the public and to health care providers, including information on the&#160;elevated risk for minority women and available treatments.</summary>
