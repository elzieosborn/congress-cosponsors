    "text": "Fighting Oppression until the Reign of Castro Ends Act or the FORCE Act\n\nThis bill imposes various prohibitions and requirements related to Cuba.\n\nSpecifically, the bill\u00a0prohibits removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism until the President determines that a transition government in Cuba is in power.\n\nFurthermore, persons (individuals or entities) subject to U.S. jurisdiction may not engage in certain direct financial transactions with an entity under the control of or acting on behalf of the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel. Specifically, such a transaction is prohibited if it would disproportionately benefit the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel at the expense of the Cuban people or private enterprise in Cuba.\n\nThe Department of State must publish and annually update a list of the Cuban entities that are subject to these transaction restrictions.\n\nThe prohibition on financial transactions shall terminate 90 days after the President certifies that Cuba's government has (1) taken the steps necessary to begin transparent, free, and fair elections; and (2) met the requirements to allow for the termination of U.S. economic embargo on Cuba.\n\nThe bill also requires the State Department to notify Congress of any U.S. engagement with Cuba no later than 14 days after such engagement."
