This bill provides lawful permanent resident status (also known as green cards) to certain individuals who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and addresses related issues.

Generally, to be eligible for a green card under this bill, an Afghan national must be (1) lawfully admitted into the United States, or (2) paroled into the United States on or after July 30, 2021. Any individual who was admitted or paroled after this bill's enactment is eligible only if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that the individual provided support to the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. DHS must provide a green card to an eligible individual who applies and meets certain requirements, including vetting requirements.

The bill also authorizes special immigrant visas for certain Afghan nationals who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan while serving in certain capacities, including an individual who (1) served in the Afghan Air Force or certain other branches of the Afghan armed forces, or (2) was a female member of certain entities in the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces. To be eligible, such an individual must receive a recommendation from the Department of Defense (DOD). DOD must review the applicant's relevant records, including service records, after receiving a recommendation request.

(Special immigrant visa holders qualify for a green card after meeting certain criteria.)

The bill also authorizes a special immigrant visa for an Afghan national who is the parent or sibling of a member or veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces.</summary>
