This bill modifies the reporting requirements for payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions. Under current law, settlement organizations are not required to report information for transactions that do not exceed $600. This bill increases the reporting threshold so that settlement organizations are exempt from reporting requirements if the applicable transactions do not exceed $10,000, or there are no more that 50 such transactions.</summary>
