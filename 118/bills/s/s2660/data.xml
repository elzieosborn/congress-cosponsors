This bill establishes programs within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)&#160;to restore and protect the Connecticut River Watershed located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont.

Specifically, the bill directs the FWS to establish a nonregulatory Connecticut River Watershed Partnership program to identify, prioritize, and implement restoration and protection activities within the watershed. It also directs the FWS to establish a grant program for restoration and protection activities in the watershed. States, tribal governments, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education may apply for the grants.</summary>
