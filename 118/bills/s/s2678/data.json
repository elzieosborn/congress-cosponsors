This requirement applies to U.S. persons in certain sectors, including advanced semiconductors and microelectronics, artificial intelligence, and satellite-based communications. Covered activities that trigger the notification requirement include investing in an entity, establishing a venture or subsidiary, or acquiring certain positions in an entity in these countries.\n\nU.S. persons must notify Treasury 14 days before engaging in a covered activity. However, if the covered activity is a secured transaction, notification must be provided not later than 14 days after the transaction.\u00a0\n\nSpecific information or documentary material provided to Treasury is not subject to public disclosure, with certain exceptions.\n\nTreasury must at least annually report to Congress a summary of the notifications received under this bill.\n\nThe Department of State must engage with allied countries to coordinate protocols, procedures, and information sharing regarding these investments. The Department of Justice has the authority to enforce this bill. \u00a0"
