    "text": "Visa Processing Improvement Act\u00a0\n\nThis bill establishes measures to reduce processing times for certain nonimmigrant visas.\n\nThe bill authorizes domestic renewal of an unexpired B (temporary visitor) visa.\n\nThe bill also expands\u00a0the authority of the Department of State to waive mandatory in-person interviews for certain nonimmigrant visa applicants, including for eligible individuals\u00a0who (1) have previously traveled to the United States through the Visa Waiver Program, or (2) are renewing a visa less than 48 months after\u00a0its expiration date.\u00a0The bill also authorizes interviews for certain B visa applications to be conducted remotely (i.e., via teleconference technology) subject to various requirements, including requirements related to security.\u00a0\n\nIf a\u00a0first-time visa applicant is eligible for a waiver of the in-person interview requirement, that individual may pay for expedited processing of that application.\n\nThe bill also requires the State Department to establish, via rulemaking, standards for consulates for nonimmigrant visa processing times. The State Department must also\u00a0assist consulates that do not meet these standards. Such assistance may include increasing staffing and implementing technological upgrades. Consulates must make interview wait time data publicly available and regularly update this information.\n\nThe bill also expands the Consular Fellows Program by 5% per year through FY2030 and requires fellows to be trained to conduct visa interviews in English.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
