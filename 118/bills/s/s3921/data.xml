This bill increases the Medicaid federal matching rate, also known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), for behavioral health expenses that exceed prior levels (i.e., as of March 31, 2019). The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must specify which services are eligible for the increased FMAP. States must use funds to supplement state funding for programs in effect as of April 1, 2021, and to increase the capacity, efficiency, and quality of services.</summary>
