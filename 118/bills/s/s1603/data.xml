This bill includes a focus on pregnant and postpartum individuals in existing public health activities to increase vaccination rates.

First, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must incorporate a focus on pregnant and postpartum individuals, including by disseminating information to obstetric health care providers, into its existing public awareness campaign about the importance of vaccinations. The bill also reauthorizes this campaign through FY2028.

Second, the bill expressly allows certain project grants for preventive health services to be used for activities to increase vaccination rates of pregnant and postpartum individuals (and their children).</summary>
