  <summary date="2023-06-01T22:33:16Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Dentist and Optometric Care Access Act of 2023 or the DOC Access Act of 2023

This bill prohibits private health insurance plans from setting rates for items and services, except for dental cleanings, provided by a doctor of optometry, of dental surgery, or of dental medicine for which the plan does not pay a substantial amount.

Additionally, an agreement between a plan and such a doctor for limited scope dental or vision benefits may last longer than two years only with the prior acceptance of the doctor for each term extension. Plans also may not restrict such a doctor's choice of laboratories or suppliers.

Such doctors may elect to waive the application of the payment amount and choice of laboratories provisions of this bill.

The bill does not supersede state laws regarding health insurers and dental or vision benefit plans.</summary>
