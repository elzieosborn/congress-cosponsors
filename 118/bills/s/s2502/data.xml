This bill requires the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) within the Department of Defense (DOD) to develop a bug bounty program for foundational artificial intelligence products being incorporated by DOD. Generally, a bug bounty program provides incentives to individuals to discover and report on vulnerabilities in an organization's software or systems.

Not later than one year after the enactment of this bill, CDAO must brief Congress on the development of bug bounty programs and long-term plans with respect to such programs.</summary>
