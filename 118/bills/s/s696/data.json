    "text": "Border Safety and Security Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to suspend the entry of certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) during any period when DHS cannot detain such an individual or return the individual to a foreign country contiguous to the United States. Specifically,\u00a0DHS must suspend the entry of\u00a0non-U.S. nationals who (1) are unlawfully present, (2) arrive in the United States at a time or place other than as designated by DHS, or (3) do not possess valid entry documents.\n\nA state may sue DHS to enforce this requirement.\n\nThe bill also authorizes DHS to suspend the entry of such non-U.S. nationals if DHS determines that such a suspension is necessary to achieve operational control over such a border.\n\n(Under current law, such non-U.S. nationals who arrive at the border are generally subject to expedited removal. However, if such an individual is found to have a credible fear of persecution, they are typically subject to detention while their asylum claim is being considered.)"
