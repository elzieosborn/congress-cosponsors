Under existing law, such projects must be specifically authorized by law.\n\nSpecifically, the bill sets the threshold to $30 million and requires the VA to develop a mechanism to adjust the threshold to account for relevant factors, such as economic and labor conditions. At least once every two years, the VA must adjust the threshold amount or publish notice indicating that no adjustment is warranted."
