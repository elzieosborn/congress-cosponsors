  <summary date="2023-10-05T19:47:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Department of Veterans Affairs Minor Construction Threshold Adjustment Act of 2023

This bill raises the threshold above which a project for the construction, alteration, or acquisition of a medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is considered a major medical facility project. Under existing law, such projects must be specifically authorized by law.

Specifically, the bill sets the threshold to $30 million and requires the VA to develop a mechanism to adjust the threshold to account for relevant factors, such as economic and labor conditions. At least once every two years, the VA must adjust the threshold amount or publish notice indicating that no adjustment is warranted.</summary>
