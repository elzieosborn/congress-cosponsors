Hospitals must screen individuals to determine if they qualify for the program as part of the discharge planning process and continue to screen these individuals as part of program participation. Qualifying individuals must live at home, be limited with respect to at least two activities of daily living, and not be eligible for certain other home services (e.g., home health services), along with other specified criteria.\n\nThe CMS must report on the impact of the program with respect to clinical outcomes and costs, particularly with respect to hospital admissions."
