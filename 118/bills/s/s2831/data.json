However, the bankruptcy court may issue a stay not exceeding 90 days regarding such a claim.\n\nComplex bankruptcies may involve creditor claims against non-debtors associated with the debtor, such as the debtor's officers, directors, or employees. Currently, in carrying out a bankruptcy plan, certain courts may release non-debtors from liability (there is a circuit split regarding this practice). \u00a0"
