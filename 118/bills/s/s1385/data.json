Such strategy shall meet specified requirements, including to emphasize increased recreational opportunities on federal land for underserved youth.\n\nFurther, the departments must\n\n establish pilot protocols at not fewer than 10 land management units to model recreation use patterns that may not be effectively measured by existing general and opportunistic survey and monitoring protocols; and alert the public to any closure or disruption to public campsites, trails, roads, and other public areas and access points in a timely manner, through an online alert system. The Office of Management and Budget must make public online a report that describes and itemizes the total amount of funding relating to outdoor recreation that was obligated in the preceding fiscal year in Treasury accounts for the departments."
