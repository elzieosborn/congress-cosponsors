This bill prohibits an elementary or secondary school from receiving federal funds unless the school complies with specified requirements related to parental consent and student gender identity.

Among other requirements, school employees may not withhold information from parents about a minor student's gender transition or gender identity. The Department of Justice or a parent or guardian may bring a civil action against a school for violations.</summary>
