    "text": "This bill requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)\u00a0to delist the population of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) within the Northern Great Lakes Region (i.e., Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan)\u00a0under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, thus removing protection for the gray wolf in such region.\n\nIn 1978, the FWS published a rule reclassifying the gray wolf as an endangered population throughout the contiguous United States and Mexico, except for the Minnesota gray wolf population, which was classified as threatened.\n\nWithin a year of this bill's enactment, the FWS must update its 2008 Post-delisting Monitoring Plan for the Western Great Lakes Distinct Population Segment of the Gray Wolf.\n\nThe bill establishes an advisory committee to consult with the FWS on updating the monitoring plan, issuing the delisting rule, and monitoring the wolf population during the 5-year post-delisting monitoring period following the issuance of the rule."
