The FAA must also issue a rule to specify that certain FAA noise standards do not apply to such an operation.\n\nCurrent regulations allow a type certificate for a restricted category aircraft to be used for the aerial dispensing of liquids (e.g., liquids for aerial fire suppression) and exclude from noise requirements certain aircraft that are dispensing fire fighting materials. Restricted category aircraft are prohibited from carrying passengers.\u00a0"
