Under the bill, operational energy means the energy required for training, moving, and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations (including energy used by tactical power systems and generators and weapons platforms).\n\nBased on the findings of the study, DOD must develop a strategy to secure access to operational energy for the Armed Forces in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nDOD must report to Congress on the findings of the study, the strategy developed as a result of the study, and any recommendations for legislative or administrative actions to support such strategy.\u00a0"
