This bill establishes affirmative defenses for individuals who use (or threaten or attempt to use) force in the commission of certain federal criminal violations.

First, an individual is justified in using (or threatening or attempting to use) non-deadly force if the individual reasonably believes it is necessary to defend against an imminent use of unlawful force. An individual who is at risk of becoming a victim of a forcible felony does not have a duty to retreat before using force to act in self-defense.

Second, an individual is justified in using (or threatening or attempting to use) deadly force if the individual reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. An individual who is at risk of becoming a victim of a forcible felony does not have a duty to retreat before using force to act in self-defense and may use any means necessary to defend himself or herself so long as the individual is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.</summary>
