This bill reestablishes and renames it the CCP Initiative to (1) counter nation-state threats to the United States; (2) curb spying by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions; (3) identify and prosecute individuals engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage; and (4) protect U.S. critical infrastructure from foreign threats.\n\nDOJ must annually brief specified congressional committees on the progress and challenges of the initiative.\n\nThe initiative terminates six years after enactment of this bill."
