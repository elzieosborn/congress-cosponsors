This bill allows an eligible child of a retired, disabled, or deceased worker to receive applicable Social Security benefits on the worker's record until age 26 if the child is in at least half-time attendance as a student at a postsecondary school or a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program.

Under current law, a child's Social Security benefits generally terminate at age 18, although (1) a child who is a full-time elementary or secondary school student may receive benefits until age 19, and (2) a child with a disability that began before age 22 may continue receiving benefits after the age of 18.</summary>
