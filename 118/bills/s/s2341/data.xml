  <summary date="2024-05-14T20:27:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill directs the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to establish a grant program within its Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program for eligible institutions to develop and carry out agriculture workforce training programs.&#160;Eligible institutions include U.S. land-grant universities, non-land-grant colleges of agriculture, junior or community colleges with agriculture programs, and area career and technical education schools with agriculture programs.

The grants must be used to develop and carry out programs to (1) promote the growth of the agriculture industry, (2) foster competitiveness within the industry, and (3) improve the training and retention of workers in the industry.

An agriculture workforce training program is a program developed by an eligible institution in collaboration with a targeted industry partner through which the industry partner provides training to enrolled students. This may include training&#160;through internships, apprenticeships, experience-based curricula, and educational programs and workshops.&#160;

The program must be implemented by January 31, 2024.</summary>
