The bill defines fish as finfish, mollusks, crustaceans, and all other forms of aquatic animal and plant life other than aquatic mammals and birds.\n\nSpecifically, a retailer of fish (or a person engaged in the business of supplying fish to a retailer) may label fish as wild USA seafood, wild American seafood, or any equivalent designation if the fish is\n\nnaturally born in the wild or hatchery-originated fish released in the wild;caught, taken, or harvested from within U.S. waters; andcaught, taken, or harvested by a vessel of the United States.If the Department of Agriculture (USDA) determines that a retailer is in violation of these labeling requirements, USDA must notify the retailer. The retailer has 30 days to comply with the labeling requirements. After 30 days, USDA may fine the retailer for an unfair or deceptive act or practice if the retailer (1) has not made a good faith effort to comply with the labeling requirements, and (2) continues to willfully violate the requirements."
