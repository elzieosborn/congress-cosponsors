    "text": "Green New Deal for Health Act\n\nThis bill establishes programs and requirements to mitigate the health effects of climate change and environmental effects of the health care sector, particularly on vulnerable populations.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must, for example, lead a research initiative to mitigate the health effects of climate change and develop a plan for preparing the health care system to respond to those effects.\n\nThe bill establishes programs and requirements for medical facilities. It funds through FY2028 the Community Health Center Program (which supports outpatient facilities for medically underserved populations) and establishes grants for sustainability and resiliency planning for medical facilities. Further, the bill revives the Hill-Burton program (which historically supported construction and modernization of medical facilities) and makes climate resiliency a program focus. It also restricts certain hospitals from terminating essential services without engaging in planning and other efforts to preserve access.\n\nThe bill also provides support for workforce and community programs. This includes (1) grants for incorporating climate change into medical training and community-based mental wellness and resiliency programs; and (2) funding through FY2028 for the National Health Services Corps, which awards educational incentives to providers in underserved areas.\n\nAdditionally, the bill addresses efforts to reduce (1) the health sector's contributions to climate change, (2) climate-related risks to pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical supply chains, and (3) health impacts of extreme heat. It also expands Medicare coverage to include items and services (e.g., solar batteries) for individuals who are medically at-risk at home from climate or man-made disasters."
