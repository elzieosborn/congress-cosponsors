The bill authorizes Indian tribal governments to submit FMAG declaration requests directly to\u00a0FEMA and receive FMAG assistance under their own declarations. Indian tribal governments may still choose instead to receive\u00a0FMAG assistance under an authorization requested by a state.\n\nAlso, the bill requires FEMA to update its FMAG regulations within 360 days after enactment to carry out the bill."
