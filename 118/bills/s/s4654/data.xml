  <summary date="2025-08-21T15:13:19Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fire Management Assistance Grants for Tribal Governments Act

This bill allows Indian tribal governments to directly participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) program, as opposed to participating through states.

Currently, only states may submit requests to FEMA for declarations authorizing FMAG assistance, and Indian tribal governments affected by a fire must use a state&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s authorization to receive FMAG assistance. The bill authorizes Indian tribal governments to submit FMAG declaration requests directly to&#160;FEMA and receive FMAG assistance under their own declarations. Indian tribal governments may still choose instead to receive&#160;FMAG assistance under an authorization requested by a state.

Also, the bill requires FEMA to update its FMAG regulations within 360 days after enactment to carry out the bill.</summary>
