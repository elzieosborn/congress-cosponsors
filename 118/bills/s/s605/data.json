Interior and USDA shall\n\n coordinate with stakeholders on the feasibility of, and identifying any resources necessary for, completing the development of the trails so identified; before identifying a trail or road as a long-distance bike trail, ensure that identifying a trail or road as a long-distance bike trail would not conflict with an existing use of the trail or road; and seek geographically equitable identification, development, and completion of long-distance bike trails."
