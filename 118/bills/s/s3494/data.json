The bill defines a country of concern as North Korea, China, Russia, Iran, or a country identified as a threat to U.S. security in an annual report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The bill defines a compromised auditor as an independent branch or office of a registered public accounting firm that is subject to the jurisdiction and laws of a country of concern, is controlled or influenced by a country of concern, or has entered into a particular type of relationship with a country of concern.\n\nFurther, board hearings to investigate and discipline registered public accounting firms must be public if a compromised auditor is a party to the hearing."
