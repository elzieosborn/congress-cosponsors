(EQIP provides technical and financial assistance to agricultural producers and forest landowners to address natural resource concerns.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill\n\n reduces the maximum payments available to a person or legal entity under EQIP to $150,000 per five-year period (from the current level of $450,000), thereby allowing for an increase in the overall number of participants in the program; reduces federal cost sharing to 40% (from 75%) for the costs associated with planning, installation, or maintenance for specified conservation practices (e.g., access roads, dams, and waste storage facilities); and removes a requirement that 50% of EQIP funding payments go to livestock production programs."
