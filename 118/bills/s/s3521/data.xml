  <summary date="2024-03-18T16:55:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing Production Tax Credit Act of 2023 

This bill allows a new tax credit for the domestic production of rare earth magnets. The magnets must be manufactured or produced in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business. The credit is disallowed if any component rare earth material used to produce such magnets is produced in a non-allied foreign nation.

The bill defines rare earth magnet as a permanent magnet comprised of an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron, or an alloy of samarium and cobalt, which may also include other material.</summary>
