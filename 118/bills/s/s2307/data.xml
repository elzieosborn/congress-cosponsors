This bill establishes requirements related to the fighter aircraft capabilities of the Air National Guard.

Specifically, the bill requires that the aircraft inventory of the Air National Guard must include at least 25 fighter aircraft squadrons, each of which must have a minimum of 18 primary aircraft authorized. Such requirement may be waived in extraordinary circumstances.

Additionally, the Department of the Air Force must develop a fighter aircraft recapitalization plan that provides for (1) the replacement and modernization of Air National Guard fighter squadrons at a rate that ensures the full recapitalization of such fighter squadrons by the end of FY2034, and (2) the fielding of the Next Generation Air Dominance family of systems in the Air National Guard.</summary>
