    "text": "Kids Off Social Media Act\n\nThis bill limits children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to social media platforms and requires both platforms and schools to implement certain restrictions on children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social media usage and screen time.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits social media platforms from knowingly allowing children under the age of 13 to create or maintain accounts. Platforms must delete existing accounts held by children and any personal data collected from child users. Platforms are also generally prohibited from using automated systems to suggest or promote content based on personal data collected from users under the age of 17. The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to enforce these provisions. States may also bring civil actions against platforms whose violations of these provisions have adversely affected residents of the state.\u00a0\n\nFurther, as a condition of receiving discounted telecommunications service under the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support (E-Rate) program, schools must use blocking or filtering technology to prevent students from accessing social media platforms on school networks and devices. Schools receiving E-Rate support must also implement policies that specify permitted device usage and screen time by grade. Schools must submit copies of their internet safety and screen time policies to the Federal Communications Commission, and the commission must make those policies publicly available in a database.\u00a0\n\nUnder the bill, social media platforms are defined as consumer-facing sites that function primarily as forums for user-generated content. Some categories of online platforms are explicitly excluded, including sites that provide primarily videoconferencing, emailing, and educational services."
