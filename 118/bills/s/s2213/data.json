It also establishes grant programs for navigation services for cancer survivors with respect to follow-up services (e.g., screenings) and other support. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must test a model to provide cancer survivorship care planning for children under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nThe bill also provides for other services and support for cancer survivors, including (1) a grant program to provide employment assistance for cancer survivors, including trainings, transportation, and childcare; and (2) Medicaid and CHIP coverage of fertility services for those with cancer and for cancer survivors."
