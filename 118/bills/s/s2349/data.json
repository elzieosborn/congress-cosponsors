The TSPoC must liaise and establish relationships with service providers and provide air travel assistance for survivors of human trafficking.\n\nThe TSPoC must provide information to an eligible service provider and assist the provider or the individual (who does not have the identification documents necessary for air travel) throughout the vetting process, travel, and arrival at the destination airport. The bill directs a\u00a0TSPoC to follow specific procedures.\n\nUnder the bill, a service provider is a nonprofit organization that provides services to individuals who are victims of human trafficking, including (1) emergency services, such as shelter, food, clothing, and transportation; (2) case management or wraparound services; (3) mental health care or other medical services; and (4) legal services.\u00a0"
