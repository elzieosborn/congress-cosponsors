Specifically, the bill adds Maryland to the current list of basin states: Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt also increases the federal cost share of a grant project that serves a small, rural, or disadvantaged community to 90% of the total cost of the project. However, the federal share may be increased to 100% of the project's total cost if the grant recipient is unable to pay, or would experience significant financial hardship if required to pay, the nonfederal share."
