    "text": "Protecting Private Job Creators Act\n\nThis bill provides statutory authority for an exemption from specified disclosure requirements applicable to fixed-income securities (e.g., corporate bonds or a certificate of deposit).\n\nUnder current securities regulations, brokers and dealers are generally prohibited from publishing securities quotations (i.e., the sale price) in over-the-counter (i.e., not on a national exchange) markets unless they have certain information about the securities issuer in their records. In October 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order granting an exemption to this rule to fixed-income securities that comply with specified safe-harbor rules. The bill provides statutory authority for this exemption."
