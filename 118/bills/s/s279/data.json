The moratorium also applies to other areas of the Outer Continental Shelf\u2014the South Atlantic Planning Area, the Straits of Florida Planning Area, or any area west of the Military Mission Line in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area\u2014if energy exploration, leasing, or development in that area has been identified as having any adverse effect on national security, military readiness, or the Department of Defense's testing capabilities.\n\nHowever, Interior may issue leases in those areas for environmental conservation purposes, including the purposes of shore protection, beach nourishment and restoration, wetlands restoration, and habitat protection."
