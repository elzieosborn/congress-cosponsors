This bill makes additional federal land available for selection under the Alaska Native Vietnam Era Veterans Land Allotment Program. The program makes Alaska Native veterans who served in the Armed Forces in Vietnam between August 5, 1964, and December 31, 1971, or their heirs eligible to receive up to 160 acres of federal land in Alaska.

 Specifically, the bill makes federal lands within units of the National Wildlife Refuge System in Alaska that were identified by the Department of the Interior in a November 2020 report as immediately available for allotment selection under the program. Interior identified over 3.6 million acres of land that should be made available for allotment selection by these veterans.</summary>
