In addition, the President must develop a strategy to address the role of China in the global pharmaceutical supply chain and related threats to national security. The United States International Development Finance Corporation must also support manufacturing projects that promote the security of pharmaceutical supply chains, reduce reliance on China, and foster cooperation with other countries."
