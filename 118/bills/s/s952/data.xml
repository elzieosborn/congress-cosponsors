This bill prohibits a state educational agency from receiving specified federal education funds unless funds are provided directly to a parent or guardian of an eligible child for certain qualified educational expenses (e.g., educational materials, tutoring, or private school tuition). Eligible child refers to a child who attends a public elementary or secondary school and such school (1) receives specified federal education funds; and (2) does not provide, for reasons related to a public health emergency or collective bargaining action, in-person instruction for all students who wish to attend.</summary>
