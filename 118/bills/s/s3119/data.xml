This bill nullifies the proposed rule issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) titled Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet and published on November 3, 2023. The bill also prohibits the FCC from adopting any substantially similar rule absent express authorization from Congress. The proposed&#160;rule classifies broadband internet as a telecommunications service for purposes of FCC regulation and prohibits broadband providers from blocking or slowing traffic to lawful content and from engaging in paid prioritization arrangements. (These provisions are commonly referred to as net neutrality rules.)</summary>
