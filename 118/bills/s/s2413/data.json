(The Abraham Accords are agreements to normalize or improve relations between Israel and four members of the Arab League: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. The Negev Forum is a framework for cooperation in the Middle East and North Africa involving several countries including Israel, Egypt, Morocco, and the United States.)\n\nThe bill establishes within the Department of State the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for the Abraham Accords, Negev Forum, and Related Integration and Normalization Fora and Agreements. The office's responsibilities include (1) leading diplomatic efforts to strengthen and expand the Negev Forum and the Abraham Accords, and (2) implementing U.S. policy to expand normalization within the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe bill also authorizes activities related to the Abraham Accords and the Negev Forum, such as (1) expanding the participation of Negev Forum countries in the Middle East Desalination Research Center; (2) supporting interfaith dialogue between Abraham Accords countries, Negev Forum countries, and other relevant actors; (3) expanding educational and cultural exchange programs; and (4) authorizing grants for initiatives to facilitate scientific and industrial research cooperation between the relevant countries.\n\nFurthermore, the bill establishes within the State Department the Young Middle East Leaders Initiative to build the capacity of young leaders in Negev Forum countries to address issues such as energy diversification, education and coexistence, and regional security."
