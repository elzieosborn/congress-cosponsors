This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to make changes to the financing of the Universal Service Fund. This fund, which is financed by fees contributed by telecommunications carriers, supports programs to expand the availability of and access to telecommunications services.

Specifically, the bill directs the FCC to (1) study the need for expanding the fund's contribution base to ensure fairness and equity in applicable contribution requirements, and (2) reform the fund's contribution system through rulemaking. In carrying out the rulemaking, the FCC must consider the findings and recommendations of its study and the impact of changes on consumers, businesses, and seniors.</summary>
