          <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PFAS Exposure Assessment and Documentation Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to include in various health evaluations an assessment of whether a member of the Armed Forces has been exposed to perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the bill requires DOD to ensure that any periodic health assessment, physical assessment for recently separated members, pre-deployment medical examination, post-deployment medical examination, and post-deployment health reassessment provided to a member of the Armed Forces includes an evaluation of whether the member has been exposed to PFAS or was based or stationed at a military installation with a known or suspected release of PFAS during the period the member was there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If any of the evaluations result in a positive determination of potential exposure to PFAS, DOD must provide blood testing during the evaluation to be included in the member's health record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DOD must pay for blood testing to determine and document potential exposure to PFAS for former members of the Armed Forces or family members of such members who lived at a location identified by DOD as having a known or suspected PFAS release during the time the individuals lived there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DOD must share results of the evaluations with the Department of Veterans Affairs and establish a registry of members of the Armed Forces who have been exposed to, or suspected to have been exposed to, PFAS. Members may elect to be excluded from the registry.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
