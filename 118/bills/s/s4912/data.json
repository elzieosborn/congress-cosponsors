All Bitcoins acquired under this bill must be held for at least 20 years unless used to retire outstanding federal debt.\n\nThe bill directs Treasury to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the secure storage of U.S. Bitcoins. The reserve must be a decentralized network of secure facilities across the United States. Existing U.S.\u00a0Bitcoin holdings must be transferred to the reserve.\u00a0States may voluntarily store Bitcoin holdings in the reserve in segregated accounts.\n\nThe bill also reduces the total amount of U.S. dollars Federal Reserve banks may hold in surplus and requires Federal Reserve banks to remit a certain amount of net earnings annually to the purchase of Bitcoins."
