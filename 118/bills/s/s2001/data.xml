This bill addresses the display and procurement of U.S. flags.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the display on federal property and the procurement by a federal agency of a U.S. flag unless it has been made in the United States.

Further, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) must conduct a study that (1) assesses and describes the enforcement scheme for country-of-origin labeling for U.S. flags; (2) determines how many fines or penalties, if any, have been imposed for violations of such scheme; and (3) identifies the percentage of violations that are subsequent violations committed by an entity that has previously been found to have violated such scheme.

Additionally, the FTC must report to Congress the results of the study and any recommendations to improve the enforcement scheme and its deterrent effect.</summary>
