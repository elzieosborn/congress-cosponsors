Those expenses may include employee salaries for the two years following the bill's enactment. The bill also allows the foundation to locate its principal office outside of the District of Columbia and encourages the foundation to locate it in a coastal state.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires the foundation to develop best practices for conducting outreach to Indian tribes.\n\nThe bill also requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to approve appointments to the foundation's board of directors.\n\nNOAA may enter into other agreements, outside of contracts, under the Marine Debris Program. NOAA may also accept in-kind contributions for the program."
