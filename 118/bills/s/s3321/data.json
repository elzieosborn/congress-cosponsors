    "text": "Lowering Broadband Costs for Consumers Act of 2023\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require large broadband service providers and edge providers (i.e., providers of online content or services, such as search engines and social media platforms) to contribute to the Universal Service Fund (USF). USF provides support for broadband and other telecommunications services to high-cost areas, schools and libraries, rural health care facilities, and the Lifeline program (an FCC program that provides a discount on phone and internet services for low-income consumers). Currently, only telecommunications companies (wireline and wireless telephone companies) contribute to USF.\n\nThe bill also directs the FCC to develop a mechanism to provide sufficient support\u00a0to certain\u00a0broadband providers that are eligible for funding\u00a0for costs incurred in offering service in high-cost areas (rural areas where market forces do not support the cost of deployment and service). Eligible costs must not be recoverable by providers through revenue or other USF support. This additional support must be limited to one provider per area.\u00a0"
