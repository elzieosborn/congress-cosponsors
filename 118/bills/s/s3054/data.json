The off-campus work must either be related to the student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s field of study or in response to severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances, subject to further requirements.)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security may engage the student's institution of higher education in oversight of the student's employment activity.\u00a0"
