Further, the system must, among other things\n\n accept applications for disaster assistance programs; permit applicants to receive status updates on such applications; allow applicants to update disaster assistance information throughout their recovery journeys; permit the distribution of information on additional recovery resources to disaster survivors that may be available in a disaster-stricken jurisdiction in coordination with appropriate federal, state, local, and tribal partners; and permit disaster assistance agencies to communicate directly with disaster survivors. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request from a disaster assistance agency to update questions in the consolidated application needed to administer the disaster assistance programs of the agency, FEMA must make those updates.\n\nThe bill (1) sets forth requirements for reports by FEMA and by the Government Accountability Office, and (2) provides for congressional briefings under specified circumstances."
