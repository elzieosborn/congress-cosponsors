    "text": "Artificial Intelligence Advancement Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires the development of a bug bounty program within the Department of Defense (DOD) and requires various studies and reports related to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe bill requires certain financial entities (e.g., the Federal Reserve System) to report on the knowledge gap on artificial intelligence.\n\nThe bill also requires the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) within DOD to develop a bug bounty program for foundational artificial intelligence models being integrated into DOD missions and operations. Generally, a bug bounty program provides incentives to individuals to discover and report on vulnerabilities in an organization's software or systems.\n\nNot later than one year after the enactment of this bill, CDAO must brief Congress on the development of bug bounty programs and long-term plans with respect to such programs.\n\nThe bill also requires CDAO to study the vulnerabilities to the privacy, security, accuracy of, and capacity to assess, artificial intelligence-enabled military applications.\n\nFinally, DOD must report on ways to improve data sharing, interoperability, and quality across DOD.\u00a0"
