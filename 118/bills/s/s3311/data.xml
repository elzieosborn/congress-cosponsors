This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to conduct a demonstration program that gives preference to domestically manufactured drugs under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The program must be conducted in at least eight states and for at least seven years. Applicable drugs include critical drugs that are needed to respond to a public health emergency and that have a vulnerable global supply chain. Preference may take the form of reduced cost-sharing, preferential treatment on formularies, bonus payments, and other specified methods.</summary>
