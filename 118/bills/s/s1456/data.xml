  <summary date="2023-11-21T14:04:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Spur Permitting of Underdeveloped Resources Act or the SPUR Act

This bill (1) accelerates the environmental review of certain federal actions related to energy; (2) modifies various laws pertaining to energy and mineral development; (3) establishes requirements related to the supply and delivery of electricity and natural gas; and (4) makes requirements concerning other natural resources.

Specifically, the bill sets forth provisions to expedite the environmental review of certain federal actions that involve energy and mineral development, energy supply, or natural resources, such as issuing permits to export liquefied natural gas.

It also establishes requirements about leasing onshore and offshore federal land for oil and gas development, including by directing the Department of the Interior to immediately resume onshore quarterly lease sales. By September 30, 2023, Interior must also approve a final 2023-2028 offshore leasing program.

The bill also sets forth provisions to prevent or remove certain limitations on mining federal land and make related requirements.

In addition, the bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to adopt tariff provisions, rate treatments, and other changes that are necessary to protect the adequacy, affordability, reliability, and security of the supply and delivery of electricity and natural gas by interstate pipelines. The bill also modifies FERC's responsibilities under a variety of laws.

Finally, the bill modifies other laws governing natural resources, such as by extending the renewal term for grazing permits and directing the Bureau of Land Management to withdraw a proposed rule titled Conservation and Landscape Health.</summary>
