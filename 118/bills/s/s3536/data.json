    "text": "Think Differently about Education Act of 2023\n\nThis bill establishes a notification requirement related to an individualized education program (IEP). (Generally, IEPs are individualized plans to ensure that a child with a disability receives a free appropriate public education.)\n\nUnder current law, states and local educational agencies (LEAs) must convene a team to develop an IEP. The composition of the team that develops the IEP is outlined in current law and allows for other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child (including related services personnel, as appropriate) to participate in this team. This bill requires the relevant agency (e.g., the LEA or state educational agency) to notify the child's parents of their right to include these other individuals with knowledge or special expertise on the child's IEP team."
