This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to annually publish a list of entities that hold a license or other authorization granted by the FCC and have ties to specified countries. An entity must be listed if the government of China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, or Venezuela (or an organization subject to the jurisdiction of any of those governments) owns an equity interest in the entity. The FCC may list additional entities that do not meet these requirements after consulting with an appropriate national security agency.</summary>
