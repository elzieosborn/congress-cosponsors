This bill expands the research and extension grant program for the coffee plant health initiative. Under current law, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) may provide competitive grants under the initiative to support research and extension activities to combat the insect known as the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei).

Specifically, the bill authorizes USDA to provide competitive grants for

 developing and disseminating science-based tools and treatments to combat plant pests and noxious weeds that impact coffee plants; establishing an area-wide integrated pest management program in areas affected by, or at risk of being affected by, plant pests or noxious weeds that impact coffee plants; surveying and collecting data on coffee plant production and health; investigating coffee plant biology, immunology, ecology, genomics, and bioinformatics; and conducting research on various factors that may contribute to or be associated with coffee plant immune systems and other serious threats to coffee plants.</summary>
