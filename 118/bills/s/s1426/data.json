It also establishes grants for\n\n multi-sector demonstration projects to mitigate trauma and toxic stress; improving outcomes for hospital patients who experience drug overdoses, suicide attempts, or violent injury; and clinical training in infant and early childhood mental health. Additionally, the bill authorizes (1) federal agencies to use specified discretionary funds for pilot projects to address traumatic exposures among children, and (2) Department of Justice (DOJ) grants to prevent trauma in children by reducing their exposure to violence and trauma.\n\nFurther, the Department of Health and Human Services must provide resources for training frontline service providers and certain community members about trauma, toxic stress, and resilience. In addition, DOJ must establish a national center to disseminate resources to law enforcement agencies to improve interactions with youth and families who are exposed to violence and trauma.\n\nThe bill also incorporates trauma-informed practices in programs for health care professional education, health care access, and educators."
