This bill establishes a transition-to-success mentoring program requiring the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to eligible entities (e.g., local educational agencies) to provide school-based mentoring programs to assist at-risk students in transitioning from middle to high school. ED must also work with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to (1) refer grant recipients to the National Mentoring Resource Center to obtain mentoring resources, and (2) provide grant recipients with information regarding transitional services for eligible students returning from correctional facilities and transition services for students with disabilities.</summary>
