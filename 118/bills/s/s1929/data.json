    "text": "PFAS-Free Firefighting Foam Transition Reporting Act\n\nThis bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to submit regular progress reports to Congress on the development and implementation of a national transition plan related to fluorine-free firefighting foam. (Fluorine-free foams do not contain any perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS.)\n\nSpecifically, the FAA report must include information on the development and implementation of a national transition plan to a fluorine-free firefighting foam that (1) meets certain performance standards for use at Part 139 airports, and (2) includes the issuance of guidance related to the use of fluorine-free firefighting foam at airports that are not Part 139 airports. (Part 139 airports include airports that serve scheduled and unscheduled air carrier operations for aircraft with more than 30 seats or serve scheduled air carrier operations for aircraft with 10-30 seats.)\n\nThe report must also include a comprehensive list of the amount of rolling stock of firefighting foam at each Part 139 airport and the number of gallons regularly kept in reserve at each airport.\n\nThe FAA must submit a progress report to Congress every 180 days until the FAA completes the development and implementation of the national transition plan."
