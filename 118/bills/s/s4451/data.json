Federal reservation systems are platforms used by managers of federal land to manage the quantity, type, distribution, and timing of recreational activities, including permitting, pricing, and lottery systems.\u00a0\n\nThe study must review the history of federal reservation systems, including a review of the considerations that led to the establishment of such systems, iterations of such systems over time, and visitor feedback. The study must also address\n\nthe benefits and challenges of implementing federal reservation systems to achieve management goals for federal land,the availability of data on the demand for recreation on federal land,how fees have been collected over time to meet agency needs, andhow federal reservation systems can be improved to reduce missed reservations and increase use in periods of high demand."
