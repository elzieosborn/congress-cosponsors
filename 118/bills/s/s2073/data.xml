  <summary date="2024-11-18T14:45:46Z" status="Passed Senate">Eliminate Useless Reports Act of 2023

This bill requires federal agencies to include a list of outdated or duplicative reporting requirements in their annual budget justifications. With respect to each recurring plan or report that is outdated or duplicative, the agency must also include (1) a recommendation on whether to end, modify, consolidate, or reduce the frequency of the report or plan; (2) a citation to each provision of law or directive in a congressional report that requires or requests the submission of the report or plan; and (3) a list of the relevant congressional committees.

If a recurring plan or report is required to be submitted by at least two federal agencies, the bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to (1) determine whether the requirement to submit the recurring plan or report is outdated or duplicative, and (2) make recommendations to Congress accordingly.</summary>
