This bill allows the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta tribes to conduct gaming activities on their land in Texas if certain conditions are met.

Currently, the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act prohibits the tribes from conducting gaming activities on their land if those activities are prohibited by Texas law. The bill instead prohibits the act from precluding or limiting the applicability of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). Therefore, the bill effectively makes IGRA the controlling federal statute governing gaming activities on the tribes' land.</summary>
