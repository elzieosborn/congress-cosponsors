    "text": "Accelerating Biomedical Innovation Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish, through a consortium of institutions of higher education, a center to accelerate the development of advanced medical countermeasures. (These are certain medical products that may be used to diagnose, prevent, or treat conditions associated with chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats or emerging infectious diseases during public health emergencies.)\n\nThe center must work on drugs or devices that are selected by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA). A drug or device is eligible for selection if it incorporates a novel technology (or uses an existing technology in a novel way) in a manner that substantially (1) furthers the development of a drug or device of interest, (2) fulfills an unmet need, or (3) develops the manufacturing process for a drug or device.\n\nThe bill also requires BARDA to coordinate with international partners to encourage global efforts to advance medical countermeasures."
