This bill requires the use of plain writing when the federal government provides information about benefits and services.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must rescind outdated guidance and issue new guidance for the creation, maintenance, and use of covered content at agencies.

Covered content means any content that is necessary for obtaining a federal benefit or service or for filing taxes or that provides information about

 such benefit or service; federal agency operations, policies, or guidance of material importance to, and posted publicly by, the agency; how to interact with or provide feedback to an agency regarding its operations, policies, or guidance; or how to navigate or interact with an agency website, digital service, or office. The OMB must report not less frequently than every two years to Congress on this bill's implementation. The OMB shall make such reports available on a public website and maintain the reports as open government data assets.

The bill incorporates plain writing requirements into statutory provisions pertaining to new websites and digital services.</summary>
