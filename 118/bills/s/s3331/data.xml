This bill allows the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a pilot grant program for projects to construct, repair, maintain, or improve transportation infrastructure and facilities for space launch and reentry sites.&#160;

Launch and reentry site operators may use the grants for projects that (1) are located at, or adjacent to, a launch or reentry site; (2) directly enable or support transportation safety or transportation activities (i.e., the movement of people or property to, from, or within a launch site); and (3) are made generally available (subject to reasonable commercial terms).

DOT may also issue&#160;a supplemental matching grant to an operator of a launch or reentry site.</summary>
