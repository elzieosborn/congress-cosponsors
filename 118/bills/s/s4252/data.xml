This bill expands coverage under the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) to include unborn livestock as LIP-eligible livestock losses.

The bill applies to unborn livestock death losses (i.e., losses of any livestock&#160;that was gestating on the date of the death of the livestock) incurred on or after January 1, 2024.

LIP is a Farm Service Agency program that provides indemnity payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality or reduced sales prices due to specified events (e.g., adverse weather, disease, or animal attack).</summary>
