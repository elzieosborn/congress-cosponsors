This bill excludes critical materials for vehicle batteries that were extracted or processed in Germany or France from any determination of the eligible amount of the new clean vehicle tax credit unless the Department of State certifies that either country has, since February 24, 2022, directly provided a cumulative amount of aid to Ukraine that is not less than the direct commitment of aid provided by the United States.

The State Department must annually review its certification of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine by Germany or France and require such countries to attain a certain level of defense spending for the duration of the war in Ukraine.</summary>
