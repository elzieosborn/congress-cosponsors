  <summary date="2025-08-28T13:41:46Z" status="Passed Senate">Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2023

This bill modifies the coastal areas belonging to the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS)&#160;and which are, therefore, ineligible to receive federal financial assistance for land development. It also expands exceptions to this restriction and establishes a coastal hazard pilot project.

Specifically, the bill updates and replaces existing CBRS maps with maps&#160;recommended&#160;by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in a 2022 report to Congress titled John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System Hurricane Sandy Remapping Project.&#160;Affected coastal areas are located in 13 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.

In addition,&#160;the bill creates&#160;new exceptions to the limitation on federal financial assistance&#160;for certain (1) aquaculture operations (e.g., shellfish production),&#160;and (2) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers coastal storm risk management projects.&#160;The bill also provides that&#160;insurable structures (i.e., walled and roofed buildings) that are on the ground in areas added to the CBRS within one year of enactment remain eligible for federal financial assistance.&#160;

The bill directs FWS&#160;to issue regulations&#160;requiring owners or lessors of real property in communities affected by the CBRS to disclose this information to prospective buyers or lessees.

The bill establishes a coastal hazard pilot project to propose definitions and criteria and produce maps of areas vulnerable to coastal hazards, such as flooding, storm surge, and erosion.</summary>
