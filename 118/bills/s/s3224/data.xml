This bill provides statutory authority for certain guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that expands the types of preventive care that may be offered under high deductible health plans (HDHPs) without a deductible.

In 2019, the IRS issued guidance that allows HDHPs to cover certain items and services for individuals with chronic conditions without a deductible, including medications and monitoring devices for those with diabetes or heart conditions. The bill provides statutory authority for this guidance.&#160;</summary>
