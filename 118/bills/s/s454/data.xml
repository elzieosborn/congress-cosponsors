This bill requires the Department of Labor to award grants to certain national youth-serving organizations for comprehensive workforce readiness programs that are provided to youth and take place before or after school, during summer vacation or a holiday, or on the weekend (i.e., out-of-school-time programs).

Such grants must be used to develop and implement nationwide youth workforce readiness programs, including for activities such as on-the-job training and leadership development opportunities, internships, and other supportive services.

The bill also requires local workforce development boards to establish youth councils as subgroups of the boards.</summary>
