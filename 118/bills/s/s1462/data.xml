This bill broadens the authority for certain individuals to carry concealed firearms in school zones and across state lines.

Specifically, the bill exempts the following categories of individuals from the federal prohibition on possessing (or discharging) a firearm in a school zone:

 certain active and retired law enforcement officers who are authorized to carry concealed firearms under federal law, and individuals who are allowed to carry concealed firearms under the law of a state. Additionally, the bill allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition (including magazines) in national parks; on state, local, or private property that is open to the public; and in certain federal facilities that are open to the public.

Finally, the bill permits states to reduce the frequency with which retired law enforcement officers must meet certain qualification standards.</summary>
