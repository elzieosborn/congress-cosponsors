Additionally, the bill allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition (including magazines) in national parks; on state, local, or private property that is open to the public; and in certain federal facilities that are open to the public.\n\nFinally, the bill permits states to reduce the frequency with which retired law enforcement officers must meet certain qualification standards."
