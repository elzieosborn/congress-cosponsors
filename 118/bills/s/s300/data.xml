This bill revises interest rates and repayment plans for federal student loans.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to set the interest rate on federal student loans made on or after July 1, 2024, at 0% and replace the interest with a one-time financing fee.

Further, the bill permits ED to credit or refund borrowers who pay the balance of their loan earlier than required by their repayment plan with the amount of the financing fee.

In addition, the bill establishes an income-dependent education assistance repayment plan as the default repayment plan for federal student loans. A borrower may select either this new plan or a 10-year fixed repayment plan.

ED must calculate annual repayment amounts and provide annual statements to borrowers.

The Department of the Treasury must transmit tax information to ED as necessary to determine a borrower's repayment obligations and financing fee adjustments.</summary>
