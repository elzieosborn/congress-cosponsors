Membership in the reserve is contingent on a mutual agreement between the agency and the individual. CISA must submit an implementation plan for congressional review before taking any further action with respect to the reserve. In addition, CISA and the Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report on the reserve. The report must include recommendations that address whether the program should be made permanent, extended, or modified."
