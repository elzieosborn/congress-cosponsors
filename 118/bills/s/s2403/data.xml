This bill increases the amount of deposit insurance available to noninterest-bearing transaction accounts through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Under current law, deposits are generally insured up to $250,000.

Specifically, noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at smaller FDIC-insured depository institutions (i.e., those with less than $225 billion in assets) and at all NCUA-insured credit unions must be fully insured against losses. In addition, no fees may be levied against an institution or credit union for insurance under this bill.&#160; &#160;</summary>
