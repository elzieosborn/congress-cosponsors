    "text": "Converting Our Waste Sustainably (COWS) Act of 2023\n\nThis bill establishes an alternative manure management program for eligible dairy and livestock producers and provides specified funds to the program for FY2024 through FY2028.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture (USDA) must establish an alternative manure management\u00a0program to award producers contracts to support carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Producers must implement management measures that include adopting\u00a0\u00a0\n\npasture-based management;alternative manure treatment and storage practices;a solid separation system (or installing a new, higher efficiency solid separation system); orscrape technologies, including vacuum technologies.USDA may provide a 100% federal cost share. Further, the bill caps the maximum payment to a person or legal entity in any five-year period at $825,000.\n\nUSDA must prioritize contracts to entities that address public health concerns (e.g., air quality and water quality) associated with dairy and livestock operations located near low-income or underserved communities. Further, USDA must ensure geographical diversity when awarding contracts.\n\nUSDA must also use a majority of the program's funds for small and mid-sized dairy and livestock operations, including beginning, limited resource, and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.\n\nThe bill also includes composting practices as eligible projects under USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Stewardship Program.\n\nFinally, USDA must review practice standards for composting facilities and soil\u00a0carbon amendments\u00a0(e.g., compost) and develop and implement a new conservation practice standard for the on-farm production of compost.\u00a0"
