  <summary date="2023-04-03T17:06:46Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ending China's Developing Nation Status Act 

This bill requires the Department of State to take actions to stop China from being classified as a developing nation by international organizations. (Generally, international organizations provide developing nations certain rights and beneficial treatment. For example, the World Trade Organization provides developing nations with so-called special and differential treatment, which includes measures that aim to increase trading opportunities for those nations.)

Under this bill, the State Department must advocate for international organizations to (1) change China's status from developing nation to developed nation, or (2) develop a mechanism to change China's status to developed nation if no mechanism currently exists.

The President may waive this requirement if doing so is in the national interest of the United States.</summary>
