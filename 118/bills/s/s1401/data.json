Higher risk facilities must receive more frequent inspections.\n\nThe bill (1) provides for the establishment in DOJ of an Ombudsman who may receive complaints, make inquiries, and recommend actions, and decline to investigate or take action, as specified; and (2) prohibits BOP retaliation against any person or entity that has instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding, investigation, or inspection under this bill.\n\nThe ombudsman shall coordinate with the BOP to educate incarcerated people, their representatives, and the public about the existence and functions of the ombudsman."
