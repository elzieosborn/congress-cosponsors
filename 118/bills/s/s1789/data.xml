This bill modifies provisions related to agents and attorneys who represent veterans in Department of Affairs (VA) benefit claims.

The VA must determine whether to recognize an individual as an agent or attorney for purposes of VA benefit claims within 90 days of receiving an application from such an individual. If the VA cannot verify whether the agent or attorney meets its qualifications and standards before the end of the 90 days, the VA must recognize the agent or attorney. If the VA determines after the 90-day period that such an agent or attorney does not meet the VA's qualifications and standards, the VA may suspend the individual without regard to notice and hearing procedures.

The VA may not refuse to recognize an agent or attorney solely because the agent or attorney charges a fee for services rendered in the preparation, presentation, or prosecution of a claim. Additionally, the bill addresses and establishes the circumstances under which fees may be charged for the preparation, presentation, or prosecution of a claim for VA benefits.

Finally, the bill imposes criminal penalties on individuals for directly or indirectly soliciting, contracting for, charging, or receiving any unauthorized fee or compensation with respect to the preparation, presentation, or prosecution of any claim for VA benefits. The commission or attempted commission of such offenses is punishable by a fine, imprisonment for up to one year, or both.</summary>
