(The CCC serves as a mandatory funding mechanism for agricultural programs.)\n\nBeginning on the date of the bill's enactment, any unobligated CCC funds held by the CCC or the Department of Agriculture (USDA) for operations not specifically authorized or provided for by Congress must be (1) transferred to the Treasury, and (2) permanently rescinded.\n\nThe bill also specifies that the CCC may not borrow money to reimburse the CCC for, or carry out, any operations not specifically authorized or provided for by Congress.\n\n(The CCC Charter Act enables the CCC to act for authorized purposes and programs; the act also provides USDA with discretionary authority to use the CCC. Congress previously restricted this discretionary authority in annual appropriations acts.)\u00a0\u00a0"
