Among other objectives, the team must (1) develop or continue the development of a scheduling system and platform that enables personnel and patients of the VA to view available appointments for VA care, (2) create a process through which patients can telephonically speak with a scheduler who can assist in determining availability and scheduling, and (3) carry out other functions with respect to health care appointments furnished by the VA.\n\nIn carrying out its objectives, the team must consult and coordinate with the deployment schedule and capabilities of the VA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Electronic Health Record Modernization Program.\n\nIf the VA determines a required objective or any feature or service in connection with an objective cannot be implemented or incorporated, the VA must report to Congress providing an explanation and setting forth a plan without that objective.\u00a0\n\nThe VA must also report to Congress on the progress in fulfilling the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objectives under the bill."
