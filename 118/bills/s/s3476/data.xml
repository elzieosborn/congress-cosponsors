The Department of Commerce must report on the value of direct investments by U.S. persons in countries of concern and in covered entities, disaggregated by sector and state of origin, and accounting for investment occurring offshore. Commerce must also report on the number of large direct investments by U.S. persons in countries of concern.

The Department of the Treasury must report on the value of portfolio investments by U.S. persons in countries of concern and in covered entities, disaggregated by sector and state of origin, and accounting for investment occurring offshore.
