This bill prohibits the District of Columbia (DC) from using federal or local funds to require that students in elementary or secondary schools receive a COVID-19 vaccination.

The bill also nullifies the Coronavirus Immunization of School Students and Early Childhood Workers Regulation Amendment Act of 2021, enacted by the DC Council. That act (1) requires COVID-19 vaccinations for students in elementary and secondary schools and staff at licensed child care facilities, and (2) provides for the electronic transmission of COVID-19 and other vaccination certifications for school attendance.</summary>
