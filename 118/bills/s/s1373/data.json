    "text": "Naloxone Affordability Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires the Government Accountability Office to study health insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs for naloxone as an over-the-counter medication.\n\nNaloxone is a medication that temporarily reverses opioid overdoses. Historically, naloxone required a prescription and so was typically covered by health insurance. However, the Food and Drug Administration approved a naloxone nasal spray (sold under the brand name Narcan) for use without a prescription on March 29, 2023, and health insurance does not generally cover over-the-counter medications."
