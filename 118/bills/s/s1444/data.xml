  <summary date="2023-10-12T19:45:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Border Patrol Enhancement Act

This bill addresses various issues related to U.S. Border Patrol staffing.

The bill establishes for the U.S. Border Patrol an authorized personnel level of 20,500 agents, which may be adjusted by the Department of Homeland Security using a validated personnel requirements determination model required by this bill. Specifically, the U.S. Border Patrol must complete a personnel requirements determination model and contract with a research entity to analyze the validity of the model.

The bill also provides for higher minimum pay rates for agents.

Furthermore, the U.S. Border Patrol must require agents, employees, and certain contract employees to participate in continuing education on various topics, including (1) the nonlethal use of force policies and de-escalation strategies; (2) identifying and responding to vulnerable populations, such as children and victims of human trafficking; and (3) relevant cultural, societal, racial, and religious training.</summary>
