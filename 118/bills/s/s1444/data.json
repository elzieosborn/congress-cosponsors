Specifically, the U.S. Border Patrol must complete a personnel requirements determination model and contract with a research entity to analyze the validity of the model.\n\nThe bill also provides for higher minimum pay rates for agents.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. Border Patrol must require agents, employees, and certain contract employees to participate in continuing education on various topics, including (1) the nonlethal use of force policies and de-escalation strategies; (2) identifying and responding to vulnerable populations, such as children and victims of human trafficking; and (3) relevant cultural, societal, racial, and religious training."
