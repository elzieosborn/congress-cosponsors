This bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to institutions of higher education, or consortia of such institutions, to establish or expand medical schools.

In awarding these grants, HHS must prioritize minority-serving institutions or those that propose to establish or expand schools in medically underserved communities or areas with shortages of health professionals where no such schools exist.</summary>
