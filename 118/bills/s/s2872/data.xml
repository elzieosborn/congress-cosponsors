  <summary date="2024-08-12T19:09:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill allows a borrower who is a victim of sex-based harassment (including sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault) to defer payment of federal student loans for up to three years. Additionally, the bill authorizes the Department of Education (ED) to waive certain requirements for repayment of grant assistance or federal student loans for a borrower whose attendance was interrupted due to such sex-based harassment.

ED must, within five years of this bill's enactment, submit a report to Congress evaluating the effectiveness of the bill's activities.</summary>
