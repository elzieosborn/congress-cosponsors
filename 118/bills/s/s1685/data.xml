This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to form the Supercomputing for Safer Chemicals (SUPERSAFE) Consortium to, among other purposes, establish rapid approaches for the development of safer alternatives to toxic substances.

Specifically, the consortium must use supercomputing, machine learning, and similar capabilities to (1) establish rapid approaches for large-scale identification of toxic substances and the development of safer alternatives to toxic substances; (2) address the need to identify safe chemicals for use in consumer and industrial products, including in the manufacturing process to support the move to safer alternatives; and (3) make recommendations on how the produced information can be applied in risk assessments in regulatory decisions.

The consortium must make all models and documentation available to the public.</summary>
