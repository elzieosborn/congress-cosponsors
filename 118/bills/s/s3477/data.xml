This bill authorizes Department of Transportation (DOT) grants for improving transit connections for students at institutions of higher education.

Specifically, grants must be used for projects such as (1) adding transit stops that serve campuses and connect to surrounding areas or other cities, (2) increasing the frequency of service or adjusting the transit time to allow students to get to and from their classes, or (3) providing for service operating costs. DOT may award the grants to partnerships of public transit providers and one or more community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, or other minority-serving institutions.</summary>
