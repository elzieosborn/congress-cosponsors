This bill expands the authority of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide technical assistance for farmer-to-farmer networks. A farmer-to-farmer network means any affiliation or association of farmers that share information, technical assistance, or any other type of mutually beneficial support.&#160;

Under the bill, USDA may enter into cooperative agreements with eligible entities to provide assistance to farmer-to-farmer networks to (1) build network capacity, connect farmers with mentors or group learning opportunities, and support goal setting; (2) increase technical assistance for farmers, ranchers, and forest owners who use different farming models, practices, and scales; and (3) establish and steward the networks.

Those eligible for the program include nonprofit entities, farmer-to-farmer networks, tribal entities, local governments, institutions of higher education, and states. USDA must prioritize&#160;agreements with entities that seek to meet the specific needs of certain farmers, ranchers, and forest owners who are historically underserved or operating in high-poverty areas.

The bill also provides for subawards to plan and conduct events, as well as to identify and develop innovative activities, in order to increase farmer access to farmer-to-farmer assistance. USDA and the Natural Resources Conservation Service must establish any necessary additional requirements for subawards.&#160;&#160;&#160;</summary>
