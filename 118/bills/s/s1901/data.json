A blank check company is a development stage company that issues a penny stock and (1) has no specific business plan or purpose, or (2) has indicated that its business plan is to merge with a company or companies.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires such a company to disclose\n\n the amount of cash per share expected to be held by the blank check company immediately prior to the merger under various redemption scenarios; side payments or agreements to pay sponsors, blank check company investors, or private investors in public equity for their participation in the merger; and fees or other payments to the sponsor, underwriter, and any other party."
