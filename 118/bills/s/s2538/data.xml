This bill provides statutory authority for a program through which the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awards grants or other support for regional biocontainment laboratories. These are laboratories that are designed to safely conduct research on dangerous pathogens and toxins to address emerging infectious diseases and other biological threats.

Additionally, HHS must establish a board consisting of grantee representatives to provide recommendations to (1) improve the quality and consistency of laboratory procedures and practices, and (2) coordinate federally funded activities carried out at the laboratories.&#160;</summary>
