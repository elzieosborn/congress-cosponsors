  <summary date="2023-12-05T14:44:31Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Feral Swine Eradication Act

This bill reauthorizes the feral swine eradication and control pilot program and removes the pilot program designation. This Department of Agriculture (USDA) program responds to the threat feral swine pose to agriculture, native ecosystems, and human and animal health.

The bill also requires USDA to ensure that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) continue monitoring an area for reoccurrence of feral swine for one year after USDA determines that feral swine has been eradicated from an eligible area.

Further, the bill includes new reporting requirements, which direct APHIS and the NRCS to submit a joint report to Congress on the program. This report must be publicly available on USDA's website.</summary>
