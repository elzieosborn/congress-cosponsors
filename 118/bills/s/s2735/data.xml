This bill authorizes the use of federal elementary and secondary education funds to purchase or use dangerous weapons for purposes of providing students with educational enrichment activities and instruction, such as archery, hunter safety education, or culinary arts.

Current law prohibits the use of these funds to provide any person with a dangerous weapon or training in the use of a dangerous weapon. The bill specifies that this prohibition shall not apply to the use of these funds for permissible program activities that provide students with educational enrichment activities and instruction, such as archery, hunter safety education, or culinary arts.</summary>
