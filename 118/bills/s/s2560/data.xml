This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to undertake certain activities to address those affected by Long COVID. The bill defines Long COVID as conditions that may result directly or indirectly from COVID-19.

Specifically, HHS must develop a voluntary registry of individuals who are affected by Long COVID, including symptoms, treatments, and demographics. HHS must additionally coordinate the response of federal agencies to address Long COVID, support related research and public health surveillance, and develop appropriate guidance and educational materials for health care providers and the public.</summary>
