  <summary date="2023-09-11T18:34:56Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Enhance Access To SNAP Act of 2023 or the EATS Act of 2023

This bill expands eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for certain students.

Specifically, the bill removes the restriction on SNAP eligibility for students to allow otherwise eligible students who are attending institutions of higher education (IHEs) at least half time to participate in SNAP. Under current law, students 18-49 years old are restricted, with exceptions, from participating in SNAP. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 temporarily exempted some students from certain SNAP eligibility requirements; these temporary student exemptions are currently scheduled to expire after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency on May 11, 2023.

Further, the bill provides that students enrolled at least half time in a recognized school, training program, or IHE constitute individual households (not residents of institutions) and may be eligible for SNAP benefits. (Participation in SNAP is limited to households.)</summary>
