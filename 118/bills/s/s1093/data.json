(Current law requires the FAA to establish air tour management plans for national parks and tribal lands that are within or abutting a national park.)\n\nThe FAA and Hawaii must enter into an agreement to establish (1) the content of an air tour management plan, (2) the procedure for establishing a plan, and (3) the responsibilities of each party in carrying out the plan.\n\nPrior to the establishment of this air tour management plan, the FAA may grant an air tour operator that is operating within Hawaii, and not within the National Park System, interim operating authority.\n\nThe legal requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to the establishment of an air tour management plan under this bill."
