This bill requires the imposition of sanctions in the event of a military invasion of Taiwan by China and addresses related issues.

If the President determines that China or any of its proxies has initiated a military invasion of Taiwan, or if a joint resolution making such a determination is enacted, the bill requires

 the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on certain senior officials of China's government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP); the Department of the Treasury to impose property-blocking sanctions on specified foreign financial institutions, including banks under the jurisdiction of China and in which China's government holds an interest; Treasury to impose property-blocking sanctions on any entity affiliated with China's government or the CCP; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prohibit the trading of the securities of an issuer affiliated with China's government or the CCP on a national securities exchange; Treasury to prohibit U.S. financial institutions from making certain investments, such as investments in an entity owned or controlled by China's government, the CCP, or China's military; the prohibition of the importation of certain goods, including goods produced wholly or in part in China or by certain entities owned or financed by China's government or the CCP; and a prohibition on any depository institution or SEC-registered securities broker or dealer processing funds transfers to or from China or for the benefit of Chinese government officials or CCP members.</summary>
