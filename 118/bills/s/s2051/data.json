For example, the act allows\u00a0NCMEC to provide support services, consultation, and assistance to missing and sexually exploited children, parents, their families, and child-serving professionals on recovery support, including counseling recommendations and community support.\n\nFurther, the act provides statutory authority for\u00a0NCMEC to facilitate requests for removing from the internet any child sexual abuse material and sexually exploitive content depicting children. (Currently, NCMEC operates an initiative to help facilitate the removal of such content from the internet.)\u00a0\n\nThe act requires\u00a0NCMEC to report additional information in its annual report on missing children. In particular,\u00a0NCMEC must include in this publicly available report the number of children reported as missing from state-sponsored care, the number of such children whose recovery was reported, and the number of such children who are likely victims of child sex trafficking.\u00a0\n\nThe act also requires\u00a0NCMEC to annually report on the criteria and processes used to establish forensic partnerships and\u00a0recommend forensic resources to law enforcement."
