  <summary date="2023-02-22T19:53:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">No Emergency Crude Oil for Foreign Adversaries Act

This bill prohibits exports of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to require as a condition of any sale of crude oil from the SPR that the oil not be exported to such countries. However, DOE may issue a waiver of the prohibition if the sale of crude oil is in the national security interests of the United States.

In addition, DOE must report on (1) the route to destination and place of refinement of all crude oil sold at auction from the SPR since November 23, 2021, and (2) the ownership of the refinement facilities at which such crude oil was refined.</summary>
