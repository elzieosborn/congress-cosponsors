This bill denies federal funds to schools providing&#160;emergency shelter or housing to certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law), subject to exceptions.

Under the bill, primary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education are ineligible for federal funds if they provide emergency shelter or housing exclusively to non-U.S. nationals under the order of state, local, or federal government. The bill excepts short-term (72 hours or less) emergency shelter made necessary by qualifying disasters.&#160;

Federal funds denied by the bill include grants, loans, loan guarantees, and property, but not certain reimbursements for services rendered.</summary>
