The consortium must coordinate research on such risks conducted and supported by various NIH institutes and offices.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must also develop a strategy to designate areas that have a high risk of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes among vulnerable individuals due to risks associated with climate change."
