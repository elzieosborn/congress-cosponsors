This bill establishes requirements and grants that address risks associated with climate change, particularly for vulnerable individuals (i.e., members of racial and ethnic minority groups, pregnant or postpartum individuals, and children younger than age three).

Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must establish a program to award grants to partnerships of community-based organizations and other entities to identify and address climate-change-related risks to these individuals at a county level.

HHS must also establish a program to award grants to health professional schools for developing&#8212;and integrating into their curriculums&#8212;education and training on identifying risks associated with climate change for vulnerable individuals.

In addition, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) must establish the Consortium on Birth and Climate Change Research. The consortium must coordinate research on such risks conducted and supported by various NIH institutes and offices.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must also develop a strategy to designate areas that have a high risk of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes among vulnerable individuals due to risks associated with climate change.</summary>
