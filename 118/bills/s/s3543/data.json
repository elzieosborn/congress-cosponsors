The monument is established within the National Park System to preserve, protect, and interpret resources associated with Black Wall Street, the Historic Greenwood District, and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921.\u00a0\n\n(The Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 occurred in the neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, referred to as America's Black Wall Street. Racial violence resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Black residents and the displacement of thousands, in what came to be known as one of the worst racial attacks in U.S. history.)\n\nUnder the bill, the Department of the Interior may acquire land within a specified area by donation, purchase, or exchange to constitute the monument.\u00a0\n\nInterior may enter into cooperative agreements with public or private entities to provide and facilitate interpretive and educational services, administrative support, and technical assistance related to the monument. Interior may also enter into agreements to mark or interpret significant historical or cultural resources or locations within the monument.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also establishes a commission to advise Interior on the development and management of the monument, including the construction of visitor facilities and infrastructure. Members of the commission must serve without compensation. Interior must consult with the commission to prepare a management plan for the monument."
