This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to help small businesses purchase cybersecurity products and services.

Specifically, the SBA must establish a website that provides a marketplace for facilitating agreements under which small businesses may cooperatively purchase cybersecurity products and services. Such website shall be free to use for small businesses and cybersecurity vendors. The SBA must also take steps to educate small businesses about the types of cybersecurity products and services that are specific to each industry sector and provide outreach to encourage use of the cooperative marketplace.

The Government Accountability Office must study and report on potential improvements to existing federal initiatives that train small businesses on how to avoid cybersecurity threats.</summary>
