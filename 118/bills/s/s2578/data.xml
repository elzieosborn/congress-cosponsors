  <summary date="2024-05-17T19:08:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill allows a state to receive cash funds under The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) to directly purchase agricultural commodities through the private commercial marketplace.

TEFAP is a federal program that helps supplement the diets of people with low income by providing them with emergency food assistance at no cost. Through TEFAP, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) purchases a variety of commodities and makes those food products (e.g., canned, frozen, dried, and fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, meat, dairy, and whole-grain and enriched grain products) available to state distributing agencies.

Specifically, the bill allows an eligible&#160;state agency to elect to receive as cash the dollar amount used by USDA to purchase the commodities to distribute to the state.&#160;</summary>
