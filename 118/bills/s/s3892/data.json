Community health agencies include nonprofits, federally qualified health centers, and other organizations that employ health workers (in accordance with certain labor standards) who have lived experience in the communities served.\n\nThe bill also allows state Medicaid programs to cover these services and provides for an increased Medicaid federal matching rate, also known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), for these services."
