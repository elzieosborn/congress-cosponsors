This bill provides for coverage of community health services under Medicare.

Community health services are services provided by a community health agency in accordance with an individual needs assessment, including preventive services (e.g., screenings) and services to address social determinants of health (e.g., educational home visits). Community health agencies include nonprofits, federally qualified health centers, and other organizations that employ health workers (in accordance with certain labor standards) who have lived experience in the communities served.

The bill also allows state Medicaid programs to cover these services and provides for an increased Medicaid federal matching rate, also known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), for these services.</summary>
