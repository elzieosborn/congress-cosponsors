    "text": "Genomics Data Security Act\n\nThis bill establishes requirements and otherwise directs the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to take actions to address national security concerns in genomic and other research.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits the use of NIH funds by any Chinese company (or its subcontractors or subsidiaries). This includes companies (1) over which the Chinese government, a Chinese national, or an entity organized under Chinese law exercises control; or (2) in which the Chinese government has a substantial interest. It also requires, as a condition of certification, that clinical laboratories that have access to U.S. health data disclose ties to the Chinese government.\n\nIn addition, the NIH must incorporate national security issues in its strategic plan and report annually on any improperly disclosed, vetted, or approved ties that NIH-funded researchers have to foreign governments.\n\nFurthermore, the Department of Health and Human Services must establish a working group to update the NIH's Genomic Data Sharing Policy with respect to intellectual property, national security, and privacy concerns."
