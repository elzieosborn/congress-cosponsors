Further, the President must prohibit any transactions between any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and a foreign digital asset transaction facilitator identified by Treasury under this bill.\n\nThe bill allows Treasury to prohibit or restrict certain fund transmittals if a foreign jurisdiction, institution, account, or transaction is of primary money laundering concern."
