    "text": "Veterans Expedited TSA Screening Safe Travel Act or the VETS Safe Travel Act\n\nThis bill makes certain veterans eligible for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) PreCheck\u00a0Program at no cost if they meet the program's background check and security requirements.\n\nVeterans who are eligible for this fee waiver are those who the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\u00a0has determined to have a service-connected disability\u00a0and require the use of a wheelchair, prosthetic limb, or other device to aid with mobility due to (1) loss, or loss of use, of an\u00a0extremity; (2) full or partial paralyzation; or (3) permanent blindness. The veteran must also be in\u00a0the patient enrollment system of the VA.\n\nThe bill specifies that the TSA may not increase enrollment fees for\u00a0the\u00a0PreCheck Program in order to\u00a0carry out this fee waiver program.\n\nThe VA and the TSA must implement a process under which eligible veterans may receive the PreCheck Program benefit.\n\nFurther, the VA and the TSA must implement a process to provide disabled veterans with effective outreach about programs that are designed to improve the screening process for passengers with disabilities. The VA and the TSA must also assess the awareness of veterans of relevant TSA programs and examine the need and feasibility of other measures to improve travel security procedures for disabled veterans."
