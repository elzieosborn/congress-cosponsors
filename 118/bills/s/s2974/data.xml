  <summary date="2024-01-26T14:15:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Pregnant Students' Rights Act of 2023

This bill requires a public institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student-aid programs to provide information to admitted and enrolled students on the rights and resources for students who are pregnant or may become pregnant. These rights and resources must exclude abortion services.

Additionally, the IHE must establish a protocol to meet with students who believe they were discriminated against based on pregnancy.

The IHE must also provide pregnancy-related questions to enrolled students and annually submit compiled responses to the Department of Education.</summary>
