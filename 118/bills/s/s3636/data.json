After testing, federal land management agencies may offer non-competitive career-conditional appointments to such veterans demonstrating necessary strengths and abilities. Such agencies may also refer veterans not demonstrating sufficient strengths and abilities in the tests to training programs, and then re-administer such tests until the veteran qualifies for a non-competitive career-conditional appointment."
