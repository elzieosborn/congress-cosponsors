  <summary date="2023-06-26T17:53:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act of 2023

This bill requires air carriers and ticket agents to offer full cash refunds for airline tickets if (1) an air carrier cancels or significantly delays a flight, or (2) a passenger cancels their ticket for a flight at least 48 hours before the scheduled departure time.

The bill permits air carriers and tickets agents to offer alternative forms of compensation, including credit or vouchers, provided that such offer is valid indefinitely, and the offer includes a clear and conspicuous notice of the passenger's right to a cash refund.

Additionally, the bill requires air carriers and ticket agents to disclose to passengers, prior to the sale of airline tickets, that they can cancel their tickets and receive a full refund.</summary>
