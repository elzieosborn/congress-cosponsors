    "text": "Protecting Students on Campus Act of 2024\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Education (ED) and institutions of higher education (IHEs) participating in federal student aid programs to distribute information on how to report alleged violations of civil rights under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires ED's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the rights\u00a0of individuals under Title VI. This campaign must be updated annually and distributed to IHEs.\n\nThe bill requires an IHE to post a link on its website on how to file a Title VI complaint with OCR. Additionally, the\u00a0IHE must annually post the materials from OCR's public awareness campaign. The information must be posted in high-traffic public places on campus (e.g., student centers) and high-traffic websites (e.g., the website for student services).\u00a0\n\nOCR must give monthly congressional briefings on (1) the number of complaints filed with OCR, (2) how OCR plans to address those complaints and the investigations opened in response to those complaints, and (3) how long those complaints remain open.\u00a0Additionally, the bill prohibits OCR from closing or dismissing a complaint due to resolution via another agency or avenue.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also requires annual reporting by IHEs on discrimination complaints. Further, the bill directs ED's Office of Inspector General to audit and study discrimination complaints."
