This bill provides FY2024 supplemental appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State for activities to respond to the attacks in Israel. The bill designates the funding as emergency spending, which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.

The bill provides appropriations to DOD for Operation and Maintenance; Procurement; and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation. The funding is provided for purposes such as

 replacing defense articles that were provided to Israel, reimbursing DOD for defense services and training provided to Israel, procuring Israel's Iron Dome and David's Sling defense systems, and developing Israel's Iron Beam defense system. The bill provides appropriations to the State Department for

 Diplomatic Programs, including Worldwide Security Protection; Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service; and the Foreign Military Financing Program. In addition, the bill includes provisions that expand the authorities of the President to transfer defense articles and services from DOD to Israel.

Finally, the bill rescinds specified unobligated funds that were provided for activities of the Internal Revenue Service.</summary>
