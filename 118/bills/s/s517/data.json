    "text": "Combating Workplace Discrimination in Correctional Facilities Act of 2023\n\nThis bill provides certain rights and protections for prisoners who refuse to or do not work while in prison.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits the Department of Justice from requiring a prisoner to participate in a work program.\n\nAdditionally, the bill allows a prisoner to file a civil rights lawsuit under federal law without first exhausting all administrative remedies. Currently, a prisoner must exhaust all administrative remedies before filing such a lawsuit.\n\nThe bill prohibits any retaliation against a prisoner for refusal to work. It also prohibits the Bureau of Prisons from disciplining a prisoner for refusal to work.\n\nFinally, the bill extends other federal statutory protections to prisoners by (1) including correctional facilities as covered employers and prisoners as covered employees under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to employment-related discrimination against imprisoned workers, and (2) requiring correctional facilities to implement certain policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973."
