The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) created the CDLIS and operates the\u00a0system under an agreement with the FMCSA. Prior to\u00a0October 1, 2023, AAMVA charged a user fee to states for the CDLIS. However, FMCSA directed AAMVA to suspend charging user fees to states for operation and maintenance of the system.\n\nThis act modifies the fee system requirements to specify that DOT may authorize a qualified operator to (1) operate, maintain, develop, modernize, and enhance the CDLIS; (2) collect fees for the system on behalf of DOT; and (3) use the collected fees. In addition, fees collected must be credited to an appropriation account or an account designated by the authorized operator.\n\nThe act also specifies that fees must\u00a0be used to operate, maintain, develop, modernize, or enhance the CDLIS, including for related personnel and administration costs.\n\nFurther, under the act, DOT may not be charged a fee for access to, use of, or data in the CDLIS. DOT must also have access to quarterly fee statements."
