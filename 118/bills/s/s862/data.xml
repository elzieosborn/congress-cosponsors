  <summary date="2023-06-22T16:53:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Restoring America's Health Care Workforce and Readiness Act This bill extends and increases enhanced funding for the National Health Services Corps (NHSC) through FY2026 and establishes an emergency services demonstration program within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide supplemental student loan repayment to current and former NHSC participants. The NHSC provides scholarships and student loan repayment awards to health care providers who agree to work in areas with health care provider shortages.

To receive supplemental payments, individuals must agree to participate in the National Disaster Medical System. This system is a partnership between HHS, the Department of Defense, and other federal departments that responds to public health and other emergencies, including by deploying medical response teams.</summary>
