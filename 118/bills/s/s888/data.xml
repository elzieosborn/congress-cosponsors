This bill modifies regulations for pilots within the general aviation sector, including private pilots who wish to share certain expenses or receive compensation for specified flights (e.g., flight sharing).

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Transportation to issue regulations authorizing

 a pilot who wants to share aircraft operating expenses to communicate with the public in any manner the pilot deems appropriate (e.g., through the internet) regarding an aircraft flight; and a personal operator (a private pilot certificate holder who flies an aircraft with eight or fewer seats) to receive compensation for flying persons or property, and not be subject to certain common carrier or commercial airliner regulations. It also sets forth definitions for the terms common carrier and personal operator as they relate to the aviation industry.</summary>
