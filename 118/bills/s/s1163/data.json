Grants may be provided to minority-serving institutions (e.g., historically Black colleges and universities) and a consortium of one or more institutions of higher education that has a partnership with an aviation company or industry association, a labor-management organization, or other specified entity.\n\nThe grants must be used to\n\n facilitate the creation of programs that educate and train students; increase access to, and the availability of, resources at existing aviation workforce programs; assist students with education, apprenticeship, internship, transportation, and certification costs; and increase student outreach and recruitment."
