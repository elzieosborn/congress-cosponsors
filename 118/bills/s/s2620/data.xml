  <summary date="2024-11-13T17:25:40Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Chesapeake National Recreation Area Act

This bill establishes the Chesapeake National Recreation Area in Maryland and Virginia as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).

The Department of the Interior may acquire land and land-based resources within the recreation area boundaries by (1) donation, (2) purchase from a willing seller with donated or appropriated funds, (3) exchange, or (4) transfer from another federal agency.

Interior, in consultation with the Chesapeake Executive Council,&#160;must prepare a management plan for the recreation area as specified by the bill. Interior must also conduct transportation planning, in coordination with the Department of Transportation and state transportation agencies, to minimize traffic in the surrounding community. Additionally, Interior must&#160;establish an advisory board for the recreation area.

Finally, the bill directs NPS's&#160;Chesapeake Bay office to administer the Chesapeake Gateways and Watertrails Network in coordination with the recreation area.</summary>
