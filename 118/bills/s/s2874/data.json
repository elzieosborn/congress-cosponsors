    "text": "Fresh Produce Procurement Reform Act of 2023\n\nThis bill directs the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) to establish a fresh produce program that serves individuals at risk of food and nutrition insecurity.\n\nSpecifically, the AMS must enter into contracts with growers, distributors, food hubs, and others to procure U.S.- grown fresh produce (excluding legumes) for distribution to organizations that serve individuals at risk (e.g., nonprofit food banks and pantries, schools, child or senior care centers, and community-based organizations).\n\nUnder the AMS contracts, the produce must meet specific requirements. For example, the produce must be grown in the United States, include locally grown produce, and include at least seven varieties of fresh produce that are distributed.\u00a0\n\nThe AMS must prioritize contracts with eligible growers, distributors, food hubs, and others that are (or source produce from)\n\nbeginning farmers;small or mid-sized farms that are structured as family farms; orsocially disadvantaged farmers, including women-owned and veteran-owned eligible entities.As part of the program, the AMS must provide (1) information to assist small farmers, beginning farmers, veteran farmers, and socially disadvantaged farmers in obtaining food safety certifications; (2) financial assistance for changes and upgrades to improve food safety; and (3) technical assistance to eligible fresh produce growers, distributors, food hubs, and others.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the Government Accountability Office must submit a report to Congress that evaluates the effectiveness of the program with respect\u00a0to, among other things, increasing\u00a0low-income households' access to a wide variety of fresh produce and increasing the federal government's procurement of fresh produce. \u00a0"
