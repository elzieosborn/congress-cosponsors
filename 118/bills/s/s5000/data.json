The memorandum of understanding must include a plan to (1) explore and address the effects that the decision may have on the contents of the fund, (2) analyze and address the long-term impact that the decision may have on hydropower production at Glen Canyon Dam, and (3) protect the Colorado River Basin and any threatened or endangered species in the basin from the effects of invasive species and sustained drought.\n\nBy way of background, Reclamation published the SEIS under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for the LTEMP in 2024.\u00a0The\u00a0SEIS revises the 2016 LTEMP Record of Decision to address two issues: (1) responding to the threat of the invasive smallmouth bass\u00a0below Glen Canyon Dam, and (2) incorporating the latest sediment science to assess when high-flow experiments should be conducted in order to protect the endangered humpback\u00a0chub."
