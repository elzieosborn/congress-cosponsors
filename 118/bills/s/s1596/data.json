The bill outlines the requirements for determining a clear and conspicuous manner as it applies to specified communications (e.g., text or video communications).\n\nThe bill directs the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to issue a regulation related to generative AI, including the criteria for determining whether an advertisement contains an image or video footage created through generative AI.\n\nThe bill also requires reporting to the FEC of paid internet or digital communications."
