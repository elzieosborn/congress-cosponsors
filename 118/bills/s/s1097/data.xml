This bill redesignates the C&#233;sar E. Ch&#225;vez National Monument established on October 8, 2012, as the C&#233;sar E. Ch&#225;vez and the Farmworker Movement National Historical Park in California and Arizona.

The boundary of the historical park shall include

 The Forty Acres in Delano, California; the Santa Rita Center in Phoenix, Arizona; and McDonnell Hall in San Jose, California. The Department of the Interior may acquire land and interests in land that are within the boundary of the park by donation, purchase from a willing seller with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange.

Interior may provide public interpretation of historic sites, museums, and resources on land not administered by Interior related to the life of C&#233;sar E. Ch&#225;vez and the history of the farmworker movement.

Interior must prepare a general management plan for the park.

The bill also requires consideration of the Farmworker Peregrinaci&#243;n National Historic Trail for designation as a national scenic trail.</summary>
