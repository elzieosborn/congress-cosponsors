This bill allows an issuer of securities to exclude a shareholder proposal from proxy statements despite whether the proposal relates to a significant social policy issue. Currently, an issuer may exclude a proposal if it deals with a matter relating to its ordinary business operations unless the proposal raises a significant social policy issue.&#160;</summary>
