The SEC must determine whether an asset is in a country of concern for purposes of this bill based on (1) the amount of capital invested in an entity that has a physical presence or employees in that country, or has a plurality of sales from that country; and (2) the proportion of that entity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total assets and liabilities located in that country.\n\nThe SEC must publish a report annually containing a list of investment advisers with private fund assets located in a country of concern.\n\nFurther, issuers of securities must report information to the SEC regarding certain large securities transactions that are exempt from registration. This information includes the issuer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s identity, associations with entities in countries of concern, details of the transaction, the beneficial owners of the issuers, and intended use of the proceeds of the transaction.\n\nThe SEC must publish a report quarterly on transactions that involve a country of concern.\u00a0"
