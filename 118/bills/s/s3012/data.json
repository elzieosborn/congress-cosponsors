Under current law, deposits are generally insured up to $250,000.\n\nSpecifically, noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at FDIC-insured depository institutions and at NCUA-insured credit unions must be insured up to $10 million. However, an institution or credit union may opt-out of this insurance during the 30-day period beginning on the date the program starts.\n\nIn addition, the maximum deposit insurance amount must be adjusted for inflation every two years.\u00a0 \u00a0"
