A single audit\u00a0is conducted by an independent auditor and includes the financial statements and federal awards of a non-federal entity.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the act requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to designate one or more federal agencies to conduct a government-wide analysis of single audit quality.\u00a0Such government-wide analysis must be completed within three years of enactment and every six years thereafter.\n\nOMB must develop a strategy, and the General Services Administration must develop analytic tools, to identify risks to federal award funds using Federal Audit Clearinghouse data.\n\nWithin four years of enactment, the Government Accountability Office must evaluate several related topics, including (1) the effectiveness of such\u00a0strategy and analytic tools, and (2) reporting burdens for auditors and audited entities.\u00a0"
