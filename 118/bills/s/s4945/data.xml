This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to carry out research, technical studies, demonstrations, and pilot programs&#160;related to the mission and programs of the Rural Business-Cooperative Service.

In carrying out these activities, USDA must&#160;promote long-term prosperity in rural areas by&#160;providing resources (e.g., capital and education) to help individuals living in rural areas start businesses, grow businesses, or find jobs.

In addition, USDA may permit demonstrations&#160;involving innovative methods of program delivery that do not meet USDA's standards, rules, regulations, or policies. USDA must determine,&#160;among other things, that permitting a demonstration&#160;is in the federal government's best interests.&#160;&#160;</summary>
