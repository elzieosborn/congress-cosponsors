The current areas of focus for 1890 COEs may also include

climate change adaptation and mitigation;fostering forestry resilience and conservation;food safety, bioprocessing, and value-added agriculture; andthe integration of the social sciences into the food and agricultural sciences.The bill also specifies that no more than 10&#160;1890 COEs may be in the program.
