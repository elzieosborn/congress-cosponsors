The court must render judgement without regard to the statute of limitations or any delay-based defense. The United States is the only entity liable for such a claim. This jurisdiction expires unless such a claim is filed within one year.

All other claims of the tribe to title arising under the Treaty of Grouseland are extinguished.</summary>
