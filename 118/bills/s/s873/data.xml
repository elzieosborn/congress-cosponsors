This bill addresses issues regarding public recreation and access to recreation on federal lands and waters, including special recreation permits for outfitting and guiding.

Among other provisions, the bill requires

 the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to identify long-distance bike trails and opportunities to develop or complete long-distance bike trails; USDA to issue guidance relating to climbing management for National Forest System land; Interior and USDA to identify and establish target shooting ranges within national forests and Bureau of Land Management districts; and Interior and the Forest Service to enter into an agreement with the Department of Commerce to foster the installation or construction of broadband internet infrastructure at developed recreation sites on federal recreational lands and waters. Interior and the Forest Service must conduct a single inventory and assessment of recreation resources for federal recreational lands and waters and publish the inventory and assessment for public comment.

Interior shall establish a Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation.

Interior and the Forest Service must (1) alert the public to closure or disruption of public campsites, trails, roads, and other public areas and access points; and (2) develop and make public a national strategy to increase the number of youth recreation visits to federal land.

The bill provides for online collection of recreation fees and for the establishment of a digital version of America the Beautiful--The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Passes.</summary>
