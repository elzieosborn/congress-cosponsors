The unclassified report shall be made available on a publicly available website. Each unclassified report and classified annex shall be made available upon request by any Member of Congress.\n\nSuch report shall (1) include a statement of the facts of the act of terrorism, (2) identify any gaps in homeland or national security to prevent future acts of terrorism, and (3) include any recommendations for additional measures to improve homeland or national security.\n\nIf the reporting agencies determine that any information required to be reported could jeopardize an ongoing investigation or prosecution, such agencies may withhold such information from reporting and shall notify Congress of that determination.\n\nReports required under this bill may be combined into a quarterly report submitted to Congress.\n\nThis bill shall terminate five years after its enactment."
