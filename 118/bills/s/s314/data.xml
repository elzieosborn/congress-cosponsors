This bill allows permanent expensing of qualified property (i.e., property with a recovery period of 20 years or less and that is computer software, water utility property, or film, television, or live theatrical production property). It also modifies depreciation provisions for residential rental property and nonresidential real property.

The bill repeals provisions for the amortization of research and experimental expenditures, thus providing for direct expensing of such expenditures.</summary>
