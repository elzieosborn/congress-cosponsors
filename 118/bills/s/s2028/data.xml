This bill revises the approval process for applications to export natural gas by expediting the process for exports to certain U.S. allies. However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may not grant expedited approval for applications to export natural gas to any nation that is (1) subject to sanctions or trade restrictions imposed by the United States, or (2) designated by an act of Congress as excluded from such expedited approval for reasons of national security.</summary>
