OPM must develop a set of criteria to establish and evaluate the number and locations of such boards that (1) factor in contemporary federal workforce data as of the date of this bill's enactment; and (2) is informed by annual changes in workforce data, including the geographic disbursement of the federal workforce and the role of remote work options.\n\nThe bill sets forth provisions regarding administration and oversight, and governance and activities, of such boards.\n\nOPM, in coordination with OMB and GSA, must establish a Federal Executive Board Fund within OPM for financing essential board functions for the purposes of staffing and operating expenses."
