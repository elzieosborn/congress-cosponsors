Additionally, government entities may not discriminate against private organizations on the basis of religion when selecting funding recipients.\n\nOrganizations that receive federal funds for social services programs may not discriminate against individuals on the basis of religion when providing services. If an individual objects to the character or affiliation of a private organization that is providing a service as part of a social services program, government entities must provide the individual with reasonable alternatives.\n\nReligious organizations may bring civil actions against entities for violations."
