The strategy must identify specific sanctions-related tools that may be effective in responding to coercive action.\n\nThe Department of Commerce must submit a report that (1) identifies critical sectors of the U.S. economy that are strategic vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party because the sector in question relies on Chinese trade or inputs, and (2) makes recommendations to reduce such vulnerabilities."
