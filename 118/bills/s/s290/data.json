    "text": "Preserving Our Commitment to Homeless Veterans Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide case management support to local housing authorities under the VA-supported housing program. The program assists veterans who are homeless and their families in finding and sustaining permanent housing.\n\nThe VA must ensure that no case manager is concurrently assigned to more than 35 veterans in each fiscal year, but may waive the requirement for a particular case manager in a particular fiscal year if it determines such a waiver is appropriate.\n\nThe VA must also ensure that each veteran to whom a case manager is assigned is located within a reasonable distance of the case manager.\n\nIf a case manager position within the Veterans Health Administration is vacant for a period of 180 days or more, the VA must seek to enter a contract with a qualified local service provider to furnish case management services until the position is filled."
