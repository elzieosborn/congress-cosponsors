HHS must work with relevant federal departments to incorporate these resources into federal training programs for public safety officers.\n\nThe bill also authorizes HHS to set up a public safety officer suicide-reporting system and a grant program for peer-support behavioral health and wellness programs within fire departments and emergency medical services agencies."
