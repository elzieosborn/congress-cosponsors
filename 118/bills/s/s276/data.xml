This bill requires the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to periodically investigate and report on immigration-related issues until there have been fewer than 35,000 apprehensions at the southwest border for three consecutive months.

When required, the reports must address certain issues, including (1) the vetting procedures applicable to non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) seeking entry into the United States who were apprehended along the southwest border, (2) the total number of individuals unlawfully present who have been processed and released into the United States, (3) the number of such individuals who have received parole, and (4) an audit of the parole applications.

The office must submit such reports (and provide briefings on the reports) to the President, Congress, DHS, and the Department of Justice.</summary>
