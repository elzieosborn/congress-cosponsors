Tier one countries meet the standards; tier two countries make some efforts to meet the standards; tier three countries make de minimis or no efforts to meet the standards.\n\nIf a country is ranked in the second or third tier, the State Department must designate an anti-corruption contact at the U.S. diplomatic post in that country to promote good governance and combat corruption.\n\nThe State Department must report annually to Congress a list of foreign persons (individuals or entities) (1) who have engaged in significant corruption in a tier three country, and (2) upon whom the President has imposed sanctions pursuant to this bill."
