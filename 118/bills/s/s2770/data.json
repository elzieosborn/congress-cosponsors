This prohibition does not apply to certain entities, such as radio or television broadcasting stations that broadcast such media with disclosures as part of a bona fide newscast.\n\nThe bill also permits a federal candidate whose voice or likeness appears in such materially deceptive AI-generated audio or visual media to bring a civil action for injunctive relief or damages."
