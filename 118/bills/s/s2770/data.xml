This bill prohibits the distribution of materially deceptive audio or visual media that is generated by artificial intelligence (AI) relating to federal candidates.

The bill generally prohibits individuals, political committees, and other entities from knowingly distributing materially deceptive AI-generated audio or visual media of a federal candidate, or in carrying out a federal election activity, with the intent to (1) influence an election, or (2) solicit funds. This prohibition does not apply to certain entities, such as radio or television broadcasting stations that broadcast such media with disclosures as part of a bona fide newscast.

The bill also permits a federal candidate whose voice or likeness appears in such materially deceptive AI-generated audio or visual media to bring a civil action for injunctive relief or damages.</summary>
