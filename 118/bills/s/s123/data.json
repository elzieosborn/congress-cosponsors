A third party settlement organization is the central organization that has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees (generally, a merchant or business) in a third party payment network.\n\nThis reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions.\n\nThe bill rescinds unobligated funds for Internal Revenue Service enforcement activities and operations support."
