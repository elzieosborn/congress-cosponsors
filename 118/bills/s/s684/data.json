    "text": "This Land Is Our Land Act\n\nThis bill prohibits certain entities related to China or the Chinese government from acquiring, leasing, or owning any interest in U.S. agricultural land.\n\nSpecifically, this prohibition applies to certain foreign individuals and entities with connections to China, including (1) a business incorporated in China; (2) a person, company, university, or organization that can legally enter into contracts, own properties, or pay taxes on behalf of the Chinese government; and (3) an individual or organization affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nAn entity must divest itself from any ownership or leased interest in U.S. agricultural land within two years of the bill's enactment. Further, within one year of enactment, an entity must sign a letter of intent to divest its interests in the land.\n\nUnder the bill, U.S. agricultural land includes land in a U.S. state or territory that is used for (1) food processing; or (2) farming, ranching, or timber production, including currently idle land that was used within the previous five years for one of these purposes.\n\nThe bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations and provides for property forfeiture and sale by public auction.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture must establish an office to monitor compliance and impose civil fines.\n\n Finally, the bill nullifies any noncompete agreement between a covered foreign entity with an ownership or leased interest in U.S. agricultural land and an employee of the entity."
