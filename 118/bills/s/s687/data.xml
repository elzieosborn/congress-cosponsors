This bill requires a study on the use of social media platforms among individuals under age 18. A social media platform is a public-facing website, internet application, or mobile internet application (e.g., social network, search engine, or email service) with at least 30 million active monthly users in the United States.

The Federal Trade Commission must coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to carry out the study, and the study must address matters such as frequency of usage, mental health effects linked to such usage, and policy recommendations.</summary>
