This bill requires the Department of Defense to make annual assessments from 2024 through 2028 with regards to the quantity and type of munitions Israel needs to defend itself and prevail in the event of sustained armed confrontation with specified adversaries (for example, Iran or Hamas). The assessment must address subjects such as (1) whether sufficient quantities and types of such munitions exist in Israeli and U.S. stockpiles, and (2) the pace at which the United States could replenish Israeli stockpiles in the event of such conflicts.</summary>
