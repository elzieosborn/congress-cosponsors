This bill authorizes various activities in connection with Civilian Conservation Centers, which are residential workforce development or training facilities for underserved youth that are operated by the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture (USDA).

For example, the bill requires USDA and Interior to offer at Civilian Conservation Centers specialized training programs focused on (1) forestry and rangeland management, (2) wildland firefighting, or (3) any other topic related to the mission of the Forest Service or Interior or the public interest. The bill authorizes USDA and Interior to directly hire qualified individuals who have successfully completed a Civilian Conservation Center training program without regard to certain civil service hiring requirements.

Additionally, USDA and Interior must establish a pilot program to expand available housing for wildland firefighters, volunteers, partner crew members, interns, and other agency employees. To carry out the program, USDA and Interior must employ individuals who are enrolled in a training program at a Civilian Conservation Center.

USDA also may conduct career and technical training demonstration programs related to natural resource conservation, forestry, or wildland firefighting.&#160;
