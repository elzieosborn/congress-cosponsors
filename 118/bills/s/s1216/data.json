The bill authorizes USDA and Interior to directly hire qualified individuals who have successfully completed a Civilian Conservation Center training program without regard to certain civil service hiring requirements.\n\nAdditionally, USDA and Interior must establish a pilot program to expand available housing for wildland firefighters, volunteers, partner crew members, interns, and other agency employees. To carry out the program, USDA and Interior must employ individuals who are enrolled in a training program at a Civilian Conservation Center.\n\nUSDA also may conduct career and technical training demonstration programs related to natural resource conservation, forestry, or wildland firefighting.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
