Specifically, the bill directs (1) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to require specified percentages of LNG exports to be transported on vessels built or retrofitted in the United States and documented under its laws, and (2) the President to require specified percentages of crude oil exports to be transported on vessels built or retrofitted in the United States and documented under its laws.\n\nThe vessels that are subject to these requirements must also have certain components that are built in the United States.\u00a0If the vessels are retrofitted, the work must be done in a shipyard in the United States. FERC and the President may waive the component requirements under specified circumstances.\u00a0\n\nThe Energy Information Administration must collect and publish information on exports of natural gas and crude oil by vessels, including forecasts and data on those exports."
