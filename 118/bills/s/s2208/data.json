    "text": "National Seafood Supply Act of 2023\n\nThis bill expands Department of Agriculture (USDA) support for domestically harvested seafood.\n\nUSDA must establish an Office of Seafood Policy and Program Integration to coordinate USDA's seafood policies and activities and to work in coordination with the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to support domestically harvested and processed wild and farmed seafood.\n\nThe bill\u00a0establishes requirements that must be met to\u00a0label fish\u00a0as wild USA seafood\u00a0or wild American seafood.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also includes\u00a0commercial fishing\u00a0in the definition of farming for the purposes of certain USDA farm loans.\n\nFurther, the bill expands the Agricultural Marketing Service's Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) requirements to\u00a0include cooked king crab and tanner crab and cooked and canned salmon. Under\u00a0COOL,\u00a0retailers must provide their customers with information regarding the source of certain foods (e.g., wild and farm-raised fish and shellfish).\n\nIn addition, the bill\u00a0requires a school food authority to receive a waiver of Buy American requirements\u00a0to purchase foreign seafood commodities and products under the\u00a0National School Lunch Program unless the commodities or products are not produced domestically or available domestically. Further, the newly created Office of Seafood Policy and Program Integration\u00a0must develop a plan to increase\u00a0seafood in the school lunch program to levels commensurate with federal dietary guidelines.\n\nFinally, USDA must conduct a\u00a0study to identify barriers to local and regional food production, processing, and market delivery in locations facing food security challenges, including Alaska and Hawaii."
