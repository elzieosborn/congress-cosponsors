  <summary date="2023-04-17T19:09:03Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Correctional Facilities Occupational Safety and Health Act of 2023

This bill extends federal workplace safety and health protections to incarcerated workers. These are individuals who (1) are incarcerated or detained in a federal, state, or local correctional facility (or a private facility operating under government contract); and (2) perform work offered or required by the correctional facility, such as prison work programs or work release programs.

States and territories that enforce their own workplace safety and health laws and standards under a plan approved by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration must include workplace protections for incarcerated workers in the plan. In addition, the Department of Labor must establish a grant program to assist states with amending their occupational safety and health laws to cover incarcerated workers and with enforcing those laws.

Furthermore, the Bureau of Prisons must ensure that its workplace safety and health program applies to incarcerated workers in the same manner as it applies to employees of the bureau.

Additionally, states and localities that participate in the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program must have workplace safety and health protections for incarcerated workers that are appropriately monitored and enforced. The bill reserves a portion of the grants for recipients to use to set up workplace safety and health protections for incarcerated workers.

The bill also requires periodic reports to Congress and the Department of Justice about the workplace and safety conditions at correctional facilities, including any potential noncompliance with relevant standards.</summary>
