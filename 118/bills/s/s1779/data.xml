This bill expands the new clean vehicle tax credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act to include&#160;clean vehicles with fewer than four wheels (e.g., motorcycles).

Additionally, the vehicles must meet battery capacity requirements; be manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways; and be capable of achieving a&#160;speed of 45 miles per hour or greater.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</summary>
