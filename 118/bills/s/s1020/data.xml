  <summary date="2023-07-14T10:44:35Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Livestock Consolidation Research Act of 2023

This bill requires the Economic Research Service (ERS) to publish a report on consolidation and concentration in the livestock industry (i.e., beef, dairy, pork, and poultry production, including broilers, eggs, and turkeys). ERS must publish the report within one year of the Census of Agriculture being made publicly available. The Census of Agriculture is conducted every five years; the 2022 census is scheduled for release in 2024.

The ERS report must include (1) information on changes in the size and location of ranches, farms, processing facilities, and packers throughout the United States; and (2) the impact of these changes on farmers, ranchers, and downstream consumers.</summary>
