The rescinded funds must be transferred, in equal proportion, to the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (which supports certain Social Security programs) and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (which supports certain Medicare programs).\n\nThe bill also permits Senators to raise a budget point of order to object to the consideration of any measure that (1) reduces Medicare or Social Security benefits, or (2) offsets the cost of provisions unrelated to carrying out Medicare using a decrease in outlays for or an increase in revenues from that program. A point of order raised on these grounds may be waived or suspended only by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senators."
