    "text": "Furthering Resource Exploration and Empowering American Energy Act or the FREE American Energy Act\n\nThis bill expedites the review of energy projects, limits executive power over certain energy projects, delegates certain energy permitting authority to states, provides statutory authority for specified environmental rules, and terminates tax credits for certain vehicles.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes deadlines by which applicable federal agencies must approve or deny permits or other authorizations for certain natural gas, oil, alternative energy (e.g., solar), oil or gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas terminals, or hydropower projects.\n\nIn addition, the bill limits executive power by (1) exempting certain projects related to oil pipelines, natural gas pipelines, or electric transmission facilities from permits required under any executive orders; and (2) rescinding Executive Order 13990, which is about protecting public health and the environment and addressing climate change.\n\nFurther, the Office of Management and Budget must initiate a rule making that establishes a process to delegate the authority to approve or deny certain oil or gas projects on federal land to states that contain the federal land.\n\nThe bill also provides statutory authority for rules issued in 2020 and titled (1) Update to the Regulations Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act; and (2) The Navigable Waters Protection Rule: Definition of \"Waters of the United States.\"\n\nFinally, the bill terminates a tax credit for certain clean vehicles placed in service after 2024 (currently 2032)."
