This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to answer questions submitted for the record by members of the congressional veterans' affairs committees within 45 business days after the date on which the VA receives the question.

The VA must provide notice to Congress if it is unable to respond within the 45-day time frame. The notice must include a justification of the inability to meet the deadline, an estimate of when an answer will be provided, and a description of the steps necessary to answer the question.

At the VA's request, other agencies must assist the VA in answering questions as necessary.</summary>
