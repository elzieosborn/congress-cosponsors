    "text": "No Federal Funding for CCP Spying and Persuasion In Education Settings (SPIES) Act of 2023\n\nThis bill generally prohibits an institution of higher education (IHE) that hosts a Confucius Institute from receiving funding from the Department of Defense (DOD). A Confucius Institute is a cultural institute directly or indirectly funded by the Chinese government.\n\nCurrently, a U.S. IHE that hosts a Confucius Institute is prohibited from receiving DOD funds (except for funds provided directly to students as educational assistance) unless that IHE receives a waiver from DOD. This bill removes DOD's waiver authority.\n\nThe bill also applies the general prohibition to international IHEs."
