  <summary date="2025-08-29T13:45:36Z" status="Passed Senate">Land Manager Housing and Workforce Improvement Act of 2024

This bill authorizes the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture (USDA) to enter into agreements, expend funds, and take certain hiring actions to address workforce housing needs within the National Park Service (NPS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Forest Service.

Specifically, Interior and USDA may recruit and directly appoint candidates who reside near sites maintained by the&#160;NPS, the FWS, or the Forest Service into the competitive service at or below specified pay levels. This authority terminates on September 30, 2030.

Further, for purposes of developing, constructing, or operating field employee housing, Interior may (1) enter into contracts, (2) acquire up to 20 acres of&#160;land within the vicinity of national parks, and (3) use proceeds from certain leases of&#160;NPS land. The bill extends Interior&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s authority to enter into cost- and service-sharing agreements with public and private entities to include agreements related to projects for employee housing.

The bill authorizes USDA to allow the use of Forest Service land and buildings by public and private entities for up to 50 years for permits related to workforce housing. (Currently, USDA may enter into such arrangements for up to 30 years.)

Interior and USDA must report to Congress on the availability and affordability of housing near&#160;NPS, BLM, FWS, and Forest Service land, among other topics. The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on certain topics related to federal workforce housing.</summary>
