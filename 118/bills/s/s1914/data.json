    "text": "Air Traffic Control Workforce Transparency Act\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide Congress with information on specific air traffic controller staffing standards and data.\n\nCurrently, the FAA must submit an annual report to Congress that contains the staffing standards used to determine the number of air traffic controllers needed to operate the U.S. air traffic control system. The bill requires the FAA report to specifically contain the Collaborative Resource Workgroup (CRWG) staffing standards used to determine the number of fully certified air traffic controllers needed. (The CRWG consists of participants from\u00a0the FAA Air Traffic Organization who\u00a0work with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association to survey facilities to support validation of or changes to the staffing targets for certified professional controllers.)\u00a0\n\nThe bill also directs the FAA to provide Congress with specific information for each FAA-operated air traffic control facility. For example, the FAA must provide information on the current certified professional controllers' staffing levels and the CRWG operational staffing targets for certified professional controllers.\u00a0"
