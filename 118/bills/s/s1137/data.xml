This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Program and establishes additional requirements for related existing programs.

Among other activities, the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Program shall

 conduct data collection and research on mental health, suicides, and attempted suicides of DHS law enforcement officers and agents; evaluate current mental health and resiliency programs within DHS components; promote education and training related to mental health, resilience, suicide prevention, stigma, and mental health resources; establish a Peer-to-Peer Support Program Advisory Council; and assist DHS components in developing a program to provide suicide prevention and resiliency support and training for families of DHS law enforcement officers and agents and for surviving families of officers and agents who have been lost to suicide. The bill requires DHS components to prioritize and improve their mental health and wellness programs.
