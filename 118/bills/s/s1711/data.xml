This bill modifies requirements relating to advance electronic information for cargo.

Specifically, the bill eliminates

 a restriction on the use of advance electronic information for commercial enforcement, and waivers of the requirement to transmit advance electronic information for countries. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must refuse entry for any international mail shipments for which advance electronic information is not transmitted for shipments received after December 31, 2023.

By December 31, 2023, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) must arrange for the transmission to CBP of information for all international mail shipments. The USPS, at least every 30 days, must publish the number of such shipments for which the information was not transmitted to CBP during the preceding 30-day period.

The bill requires monthly reports of specified information, including the volume of international mail shipments and other cargo received by the USPS and private sector importers for which advance electronic information is submitted.</summary>
