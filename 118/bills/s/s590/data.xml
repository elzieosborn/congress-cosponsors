This bill permits the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to acquire supplies and services through its procurement channels for non-NASA space activities carried out by other entities on NASA properties if certain conditions are met.

NASA may acquire supplies and services at the request of a private or commercial company or state government if NASA determines that doing so (1) is in the best interest of the federal government, and (2) neither interferes with NASA requirements nor competes with other commercial space activities.

NASA must also have full reimbursable funding from a company or state government before incurring any obligation for the delivery of supplies or services acquired on behalf of the company or state government.</summary>
