Additionally, funds already appropriated for such construction must remain available until expended.\n\nThe bill also modifies the requirements for the physical barriers along the southern border and requires DHS to consult with the labor organization representing border patrol agents about the safety and effectiveness of the agents deployed in the vicinity of the barriers.\n\nFinally, the bill exempts these construction projects from certain legal requirements, including requirements stemming from the Administrative Procedure Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the federal laws regarding public contracts."
