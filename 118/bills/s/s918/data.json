    "text": "Strengthening Enforcement to Curtail Unlawful, Risky Entrance to Flights Act of 2023 or the SECURE Flights Act of 2023\n\nThis bill prohibits the use of certain warrants and other documents issued by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as proof of identification at airport security checkpoints.\n\nIf an individual uses a prohibited document as proof of identification, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) must inform ICE, CBP, and local law enforcement to determine whether the individual is in violation of any term of release from custody of the agency. An individual who is in violation may not be permitted to enter a sterile area (e.g., the boarding area) unless the individual (1) is being removed or deported from the United States, or (2) presents a covered valid and unexpired identification document. Examples of covered identification documents include a U.S. passport, a biometrically secure card issued by a DHS trusted or registered traveler program, a state-issued enhanced driver's license, and an employment authorization document issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nFurther, prior to authorizing entry into a sterile area, the TSA must collect biometric information from an individual who (1) does not present a covered identification document, and (2) the TSA cannot verify is a U.S. national. The TSA must submit the information to the national Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT)."
