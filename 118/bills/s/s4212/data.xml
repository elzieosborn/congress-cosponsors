This bill directs the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) of the Department of Commerce to promote tourism to music-related and sports attractions.

The bill requires NTTO to promote domestic and international travel and tourism to&#160;U.S. music festivals, concert venues, and other music-related attractions and locations. The bill also expands NTTO's current mandate to facilitate sports and recreation events and activities to include the&#160;promotion of international travel and tourism to such activities in the United States.

NTTO must report its activities and findings to Congress within one year after the bill's enactment and, thereafter, every two years.</summary>
