This bill permanently allows the Department of the Treasury to access certain death records maintained by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to prevent improper payments to deceased individuals.

Current law requires the SSA to share its Death Master File with the Do Not Pay system maintained by Treasury for three years. The bill makes this requirement permanent, and it allows Treasury to compare SSA death records with personally identifiable information from other federal records systems and to share these comparisons with any federal or state agency that is authorized to use the Do Not Pay system.</summary>
