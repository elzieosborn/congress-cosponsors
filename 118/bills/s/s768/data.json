This bill establishes a special disclosure rule relating to organizations affiliated with China's government, the CCP, or the PLA. Specifically, the bill requires an IHE to disclose a gift from or contract with such an organization that is valued at $5,000 or more, considered alone or in combination with all other gifts from or contracts with that organization.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires an IHE that receives federal grants to annually file a report with ED that identifies any activities conducted pursuant to a contract or other agreement between the IHE and such an organization, including any joint research or academic exchanges. Such contracts or agreements must be publicly available on the IHE's website."
