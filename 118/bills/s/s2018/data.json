In assessing where cellular service is most needed, the NPS must consider locations where the availability of cellular service in a developed area of a park would increase public access to emergency services and traveler information or the communications capabilities of NPS employees. The NPS must complete the assessment within one year of the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enactment.\u00a0\n\nFurther, within three years of the bill's enactment, the NPS must develop a plan based on the results of the assessment to install broadband and cellular service infrastructure at locations within the National Park System. In developing the plan, the NPS must consult with affected tribes and local stakeholders.\u00a0\n\nThe plan must (1) be technology neutral; (2) provide for infrastructure to be located in previously developed areas or areas zoned for uses that would support infrastructure; and (3) avoid or minimize impacts to cultural and natural resources, the visitor experience, and park viewsheds. The plan must also provide for the use of public-private partnerships for the installation of equipment and provision of broadband or cellular service."
