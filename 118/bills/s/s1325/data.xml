  <summary date="2024-05-30T16:27:22Z" status="Reported to Senate">Western Hemisphere Partnership Act of 2023

This bill states that the Department of State should collaborate with democratic partners to promote certain objectives in the Western Hemisphere: (1) improvement of security conditions and the rule of law; (2) digitalization and cybersecurity; (3) improvement of economic conditions; and (4) transparent, accountable, and democratic governance. These objectives do not apply to Cuba, Nicaragua, or Venezuela.

The bill also requires the President to submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for investment, trade, and development in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. The focus of this strategy shall be on increasing exports of U.S. goods and services to those regions.

The State Department must&#160;report to Congress on efforts by the Maduro regime of Venezuela to detain U.S. citizens and permanent residents.</summary>
