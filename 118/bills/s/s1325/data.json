These objectives do not apply to Cuba, Nicaragua, or Venezuela.\n\nThe bill also requires the President to submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for investment, trade, and development in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. The focus of this strategy shall be on increasing exports of U.S. goods and services to those regions.\n\nThe State Department must\u00a0report to Congress on efforts by the Maduro regime of Venezuela to detain U.S. citizens and permanent residents."
