This bill extends for an additional five years the time period during which an eligible Alaska Native veteran may apply for a land allotment under the Alaska Native Vietnam Era Veterans Land Allotment Program. The program makes Alaska Native veterans who served in the Armed Forces in Vietnam between August 5, 1964, and December 31, 1971, or their heirs eligible to receive up to 160 acres of federal land in Alaska.

Under the current program, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management may accept applications through December 29, 2025. This bill extends this time period for an additional five years to December 29, 2030.</summary>
