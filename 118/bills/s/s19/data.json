    "text": "Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act or the FRESH Act\n\n This bill gives states the sole authority to promulgate or enforce any regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing on or under any land within their boundaries. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a process to extract underground resources such as oil or gas from a geologic formation by injecting water, a propping agent (e.g., sand), and chemical additives into a well under enough pressure to fracture the geological formation.\n\nHydraulic fracturing on federal land must comply with the law of the state in which the land is located."
