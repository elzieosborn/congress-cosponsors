This bill imposes sanctions on the parent company of the TikTok social media service, ByteDance Limited, as long as it is involved with TikTok.

Specifically, the President must impose property-blocking sanctions on ByteDance or any successor entity or subsidiary if it is involved in matters relating to (1) TikTok or any successor service; or (2) information, video, or data associated with such a service.

 The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) must report to Congress on any national security threats posed by TikTok, including the ability of China's government to access or use the data of U.S. users of TikTok. Within 180 days of this bill's enactment, ODNI must brief Congress on the implementation of the bill.</summary>
