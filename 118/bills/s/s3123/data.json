The standards must ensure compatibility and interoperability among applicable federal databases with respect to the collection and dissemination of such data.\n\nWithin five years of the bill's enactment, the Forest Service and Interior\u00a0must also digitize and make publicly available online, as applicable, certain geographic information system data about (1) federal waterway restrictions, (2) federal waterway access and navigation information, and (3) federal fishing restrictions. Data on waterway restrictions, waterway access, and navigation must be updated at least annually, and data on fishing restrictions must be updated in real time as changes take effect.\n\nFinally, the\u00a0Forest Service and Interior\u00a0must develop a process to allow members of the public to submit questions or comments about waterway restrictions,\u00a0waterway access, and navigation."
