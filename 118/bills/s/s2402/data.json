The partnerships must use the subgrants to (1) carry out activities that support the development and implementation of career pathway programs, and (2) provide support services to students engaged in career pathway programs.\n\nLabor must ensure an equitable geographic distribution of such grants, including to rural areas and other regions that have traditionally been underserved by regional economic development and industry or sector partnership activities."
