    "text": "Ensuring American Security and Protecting Afghan Allies Act This bill provides conditional permanent resident status to certain individuals who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and addresses related issues. (A conditional permanent resident becomes a lawful permanent resident, also known as a green card holder, if the conditions are removed.)\n\nGenerally, to be eligible for a conditional green card under this bill, an Afghan national must be (1) lawfully admitted into the United States on or before this bill's enactment, or (2) paroled into the United States between July 30, 2021, and this bill's enactment.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must remove the conditions if, by a certain date, DHS determines that the individual (1) is not inadmissible under any statutory grounds, and (2) does not pose a national security concern. DHS may waive certain grounds of inadmissibility for humanitarian purposes or family unity.\n\n The bill also designates certain Afghan nationals who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan as priority refugees of special humanitarian concern, including an individual who (1) served in certain branches of the Afghan armed forces, or (2) was a female member of certain entities in the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces. The Department of Defense must establish a process to review requests for such a designation.\n\nThe bill also authorizes a special immigrant visa for an Afghan national who is the parent or sibling of a member or veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. (Special immigrant visa holders qualify for a green card after meeting certain criteria.)"
