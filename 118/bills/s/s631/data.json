Such entities must (1) provide a reasonable means for individuals to access and delete their health data, and (2) maintain and publish a privacy policy disclosing their practices for handling personal health data.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits commercial entities from using personal health data for commercial advertising.\n\nThe bill also prohibits the sale of location data to or by data brokers, including data volunteered by an individual, data derived from a medical center, data from a wearable fitness tracker, and data from web browsing history.\n\nThe bill provides for enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and by private civil actions."
