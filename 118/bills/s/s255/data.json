By contrast, other asylum applicants (e.g., an individual who entered the United States after this bill's enactment at a place other than a designated port of entry) must wait 180 days after filing an asylum application to be eligible for work authorization, as required under current law for all asylum applicants.\n\nFurthermore, asylum applicants who meet all the requirements to receive expedited authorization shall be entitled to work authorization. By contrast, other asylum applicants may, but are not entitled to, receive work authorization, as specified under current law for all asylum applicants."
