  <summary date="2023-10-04T14:16:42Z" status="Introduced in Senate">A. Donald McEachin Environmental Justice For All Act

This bill establishes several environmental justice requirements, advisory bodies, and programs to address the disproportionate adverse human health or environmental effects of federal laws or programs on communities of color, low-income communities, or tribal and indigenous communities.

Specifically, the bill expands Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit federally funded programs, policies, practices, or activities from causing disparate impacts on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Aggrieved persons may seek legal remedy when faced with such discrimination.

In addition, the bill directs agencies to follow certain requirements concerning environmental justice, including new environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

Further, it creates a variety of advisory bodies and positions, such as the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council. Among other things, the council must issue an environmental justice strategy.

It also establishes requirements and programs concerning chemicals or toxic ingredients in certain products. For example, the bill (1) requires certain products (e.g., cosmetics) to include a list of ingredients or warnings; and (2) provides grants for research on designing safer alternatives to chemicals in certain consumer, cleaning, toy, or baby products that have an inherent toxicity or that are associated with chronic adverse health effects.

Finally, it creates a variety of funding programs, such as a grant program to enhance access to park and recreational opportunities in an urban areas.</summary>
