Specifically, on such basis, FEMA may terminate a contract between a covered entity\u00a0and a Write Your Own company (a property and casualty company that writes and services federal standard flood insurance policies in its own name).\n\nFEMA shall establish a process for a covered entity to appeal such a termination.\n\nNeither FEMA nor a Write Your Own company is required to make an early-termination payout to a covered entity with respect to a contract terminated under the\u00a0bill."
