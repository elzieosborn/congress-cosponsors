Specifically, the symbol used on the exchange must identify these entities as consolidated variable interest entities. (A consolidated variable interest entity is a business structure where an investor holds a controlling interest in an entity through contractual agreements rather than having a majority of voting rights.)\n\nIn addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission must require brokers and dealers to warn investors in these entities that those investors may lack legal recourse with respect to these investments."
