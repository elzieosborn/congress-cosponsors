This bill allows recipients of demonstration grants for preventing and detecting elder abuse to use the grants for state court programs that use clinics supervised by a licensed attorney to recruit and train law students to represent individuals in guardianship cases and serve as guardians ad litem. (Guardians ad litem are court-appointed representatives for individuals who are unable to represent their own interests, typically because they are minors or declared legally incompetent.)</summary>
