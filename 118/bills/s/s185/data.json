    "text": "Native American Direct Loan Improvement Act of 2023\n\nThis bill revises the Native American Direct Loan (NADL) program, which is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Under the NADL program, the VA makes loans directly to Native American veterans to purchase, construct, improve, or refinance their homes located on federal trust land.\n\nSpecifically, the bill expands the NADL program by allowing Native American veterans to refinance other existing mortgage loans on the same property if certain conditions are met.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires the VA to conduct additional program outreach by partnering with local service providers (e.g., tribal organizations and nonprofit organizations) to conduct outreach, homebuyer education, housing counseling, and post-purchase education.\n\nThe bill directs the VA to assign a sufficient number of personnel to carry out the NADL program, including construction and valuation specialists to assist with issues unique to new construction and renovations on trust land.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the VA to make a loan with a 1% interest rate to a Native community development financial institution to allow the institution to relend loan amounts to qualified Native American veterans residing on federal trust land."
