    "text": "Servicemember Enrollment and Readmission for Valuable Education Act or the SERVE Act\n\nThis bill revises the definition of service in the uniformed services as the term relates to readmission requirements for servicemembers.\n\nCurrent law requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) to readmit students who take a leave of absence to perform active military service at the same academic status they had attained prior to such service. This readmission requirement currently applies to servicemembers who perform service in the uniformed services for a period of more than 30 days under a call or order to active duty of more than 30 days. This bill removes the 30-day requirement, thereby allowing a student who is serving for less than 30 days to be readmitted to their IHE."
