This bill restricts the use of federal funds for the salaries or expenses of political employees if the President's budget is not submitted to Congress by the first Monday in February as required by law.

Specifically, if the President's budget is not submitted to Congress on or before the first Monday in February of a year, federal funds may not be used for a political employee's salary or expenses for service by the employee during the period beginning on the first Tuesday of February of that year and ending on the date the budget is submitted.

On the earliest possible date after the President's budget is submitted, political employees whose salaries or expenses were not paid for service during a period in which the President's budget had not yet been submitted must be paid for that period.</summary>
