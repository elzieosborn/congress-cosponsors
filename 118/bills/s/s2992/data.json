Members of this task force include employees of the Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nThe bill requires the task force to (1) identify trade barriers to U.S. agricultural exports that are vulnerable to dispute settlement under the World Trade Organization (WTO) or other trade agreements to which the United States is a party, (2) develop and implement a strategy for enforcing violations of trade agreements related to those trade barriers, (3) identify like-minded trading partners that could act as complainants on disputes relating to specific trade barriers that are systemically or economically important to the United States, and (4) submit periodic reports to Congress.\n\nIn its first report, the task force must include a plan for filing a request for consultations under the WTO with respect to agricultural price supports implemented by the Indian government."
