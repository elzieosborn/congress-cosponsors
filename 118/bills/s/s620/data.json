Currently, only revenue generated by certain nearshore areas of the OCS is shared with Alaska. The bill requires Treasury to share a specified portion of revenue derived from all areas in the Alaska OCS region. Alaska may use the funding from such revenue for coastal protection, coastal infrastructure, systems to reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, programs at institutions of higher education, and other related purposes."
