The term aquaculture means the propagation and rearing of aquatic species in controlled or selected environments, including ocean ranching (with exclusions).\n\nSpecifically, the Office of Aquaculture must encourage and promote aquaculture operations that promote U.S. food security and limit adverse environmental effects.\n\nUSDA must also establish a 14-member Aquaculture Advisory Committee to advise USDA on (1) developing policies and outreach relating to sustainable aquaculture practices; and (2) the history, use, and preservation of indigenous and traditional aquaculture practices and ecological knowledge."
