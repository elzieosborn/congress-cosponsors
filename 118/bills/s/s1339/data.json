    "text": "Pharmacy Benefit Manager Reform Act\n\nThis bill establishes various requirements for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) with respect to services provided to health insurance plans.\n\nFirst, PBMs must report annually to the plan sponsor certain information about the PBM's services, including the amount of prescription drug copayment assistance funded by drug manufacturers, a list of covered drugs billed under the plan during the reporting period, and the total net spending by the health plan on prescription drugs. PBMs also must provide plan sponsors with a supplementary report every six months with specified information about drugs that were dispensed under the plan by pharmacies that are wholly or partially owned by the PBM.\n\nSecond, the bill prohibits spread pricing. Under the bill, spread pricing occurs when a PBM charges an insurance plan (or an insurance plan charges plan participants) a price for a prescription drug that exceeds the price paid to the pharmacy for the drug.\n\nFinally, PBMs must remit to the plan sponsor all rebates, fees, alternative discounts, and other remuneration received from a drug manufacturer.\n\nThe bill establishes civil penalties for violations of these requirements and provides funding for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Department of Labor to implement the provisions of this bill."
