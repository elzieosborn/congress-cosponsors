This bill allows foreign states to be sued in a U.S. court for physical injury to a person or property or death occurring in the United States as a result of fentanyl trafficking. (Typically, a foreign state is immune from lawsuits filed against it in a U.S. court.)

Specifically, a foreign state is not immune from a lawsuit seeking damages for (1) an act of fentanyl trafficking in or into the United States, or (2) a tortious act or acts regardless where the tortious act or acts occurred.

If the United States is in discussions with a foreign state that is seeking to resolve claims related to fentanyl trafficking or tortious acts, the Department of Justice may intervene and seek a stay in a case filed under this bill involving the foreign state.</summary>
