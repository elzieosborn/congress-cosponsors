(Typically, a foreign state is immune from lawsuits filed against it in a U.S. court.)\n\nSpecifically, a foreign state is not immune from a lawsuit seeking damages for (1) an act of fentanyl trafficking in or into the United States, or (2) a tortious act or acts regardless where the tortious act or acts occurred.\n\nIf the United States is in discussions with a foreign state that is seeking to resolve claims related to fentanyl trafficking or tortious acts, the Department of Justice may intervene and seek a stay in a case filed under this bill involving the foreign state."
