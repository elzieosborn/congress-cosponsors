This bill imposes additional requirements on countries that are part of the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens or nationals of such countries to travel to the United States without a visa.

Specifically, a country that is part of the program must (1) share information with the United States about any of its citizens or nationals who are known or suspected to be involved with terrorism, and (2) establish frameworks for enhanced law enforcement cooperation with the United States.

The Department of Homeland Security must terminate a country from the program if it fails to comply with these requirements.</summary>
