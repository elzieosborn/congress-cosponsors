    "text": "Nutrition Services Improvement Plan Act\n\nThis bill directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study to evaluate the Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP), which is currently administered by the Administration on Aging. The study must assess the ability of NSIP to (1) engage and support local farms in supplying food products for nutrition services, and (2) support produce prescription programs and medically tailored meals for older individuals.\n\nAs background, NSIP provides funds to states, U.S. territories, and Indian tribal organizations to purchase food or to cover the costs of food commodities provided by the Department of Agriculture for the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs (e.g., Meals on Wheels)."
