This bill removes certain requirements for biosimilars to be designated as interchangeable. (Biosimilars that are designated as interchangeable may be substituted for the reference product at a pharmacy without a new prescription, depending on state pharmacy laws.)

Specifically, the bill establishes a presumption that an approved biosimilar is interchangeable with the reference product without the need for additional evidence from the manufacturer, and it removes the applicable exclusivity periods for a first interchangeable biosimilar (i.e., a product that is the first interchangeable biosimilar to be approved with respect to the reference product).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may require a manufacturer of a biosimilar to conduct a safety study with respect to switching or alternating between the biosimilar and the reference product, but only after the FDA briefs certain members of specified congressional committees to explain why the study is necessary.
