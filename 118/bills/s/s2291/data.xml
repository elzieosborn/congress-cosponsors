  <summary date="2024-02-23T15:29:14Z" status="Reported to Senate">Northern Border Coordination Act

This bill establishes a center to coordinate border security activities along the U.S.-Canada border and addresses related issues.

Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must establish the Northern Border Coordination Center to serve as the centralized coordination center for operations, domain awareness, intelligence, and engagement with federal, state, tribal, local, and international partners.

The center must also (1) serve as a coordination mechanism for implementing, evaluating, and updating the Northern Border Security Strategy; and (2) support counter-unmanned aircraft systems operations.

The bill also requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine Operations to (1) establish capability at the center to support northern border missions, including in the Great Lakes region; (2) locate personnel and resources with the center to support air and maritime domain awareness; and (3) coordinate with relevant DHS components on various activities, including efforts to monitor unmanned aircraft systems.</summary>
