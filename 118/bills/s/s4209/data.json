Interior may not use eminent domain to acquire such land.\u00a0\n\nInterior must allow hunting, fishing, and any other outdoor recreation activity on the newly acquired land provided the activity was in existence before the acquisition.\n\nInterior must also generally allow the gathering of fiddlehead ferns (Matteuccia struthiopteris) on the land for noncommercial use and consumption, but may impose limits if such gathering could adversely affect the monument\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resources.\u00a0\n\nInterior must collaborate with local communities and tribal governments to educate the public about the natural environment and history of land management in the monument, including the shaping of the land by Native communities and practices, timber management, and other activities.\u00a0\n\nThe bill permits Interior to conduct noncommercial timber harvests as necessary. Interior must collaborate with stakeholders to ensure safe interactions between logging operations and visitors.\n\nSeparately, the bill permits Interior to acquire up to 10 acres of land outside the boundaries but within the vicinity of the monument for visitor services and administration. Interior may enter into agreements with the State of Maine, tribal or local governments, or private entities to accomplish such an acquisition and to develop a cooperative information center for the monument."
