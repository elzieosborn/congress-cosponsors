  <summary date="2023-11-08T11:41:15Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill limits federal liability protection, sometimes referred to as Section 230 protection, that generally precludes providers and users of an interactive computer service from being held legally responsible for content provided by a third party.

Specifically, the bill removes the protection if the conduct giving rise to the liability involves the use or provision of generative artificial intelligence (i.e., an artificial intelligence system that is capable of generating novel text, video, images, audio, and other media based on prompts or other forms of data provided by a person).</summary>
