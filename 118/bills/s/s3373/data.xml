FERC is authorized, upon the request of the licensees, to extend projects that were issued a license before March 13, 2020. (Under existing law, licensees must commence construction of licensed projects within a time fixed in their license.) The bill also provides that FERC may reinstate such licenses, effective as of the date they expire.</summary>
