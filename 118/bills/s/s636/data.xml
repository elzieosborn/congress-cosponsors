  <summary date="2023-05-04T14:27:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Dolores River National Conservation Area and Special Management Area Act

This bill establishes the Dolores River National Conservation Area and the Dolores River Special Management Area in Colorado.

A management plan must be developed for each area. The bill allows for the continued use of the areas by members of Indian tribes for traditional ceremonies and as a source of traditional plants and other materials.

The Department of the Interior shall establish the Dolores River National Conservation Area Advisory Council.

Interior must manage the areas identified as Ponderosa Gorge in a manner that maintains its wilderness character, including certain restrictions on (1) road construction; (2) the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, or mechanical transport; and (3) projects undertaken for the purpose of harvesting commercial timber.

The bill releases segments of the Dolores River inside the areas from further study for potential addition to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System.</summary>
