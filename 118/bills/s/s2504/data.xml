  <summary date="2024-11-20T17:38:37Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Enabling Farmers to Benefit from Processing Nutrition Programs Act of 2023

This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a streamlined process for farmers and ranchers to provide benefits under certain federal nutrition programs (i.e., the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program).

Specifically, USDA must establish a streamlined application process&#160;for farmers and ranchers to apply to be vendors under the nutrition programs, including by developing a single application for the programs or an information sharing system. USDA must also develop a streamlined process for these vendors to use standardized technology&#160;to process program benefits&#160;(such as a single piece of equipment or a mobile application).

Further, USDA must ensure that the program benefit processing equipment and systems made available by a state agency is appropriate for the entity. For example, this includes ensuring wireless or mobile processing equipment and technology systems are appropriate&#160;for farmers markets and other direct-to-consumer markets.&#160;&#160;</summary>
