    "text": "Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Act of 2023\n\nThis bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to study and establish research and demonstration sites on agrivoltaic systems. The bill defines agrivoltaic system as a system under which solar energy production and agricultural production, including crop or animal production, occur in an integrated manner on the same piece of land through the duration of a project.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs USDA to study agrivoltaic systems, which includes conducting a review of current research and identifying research gaps. USDA must also develop a five-year plan for using USDA's research, extension, outreach, conservation, and renewable energy activities to better support agrivoltaic systems that do not displace agricultural production.\n\nUSDA must also develop a definition for agrivoltaic system for the purposes of incorporating these systems into federal agriculture and energy programs, and investment tax credits.\n\nIn addition, the Agricultural Research Service must establish and maintain a network of agrivoltaic systems research and demonstration sites in multiple U.S. regions to investigate increasing agricultural productivity and profitability, enhancing agricultural resilience, protecting biodiversity, and increasing economic opportunities in rural communities."
