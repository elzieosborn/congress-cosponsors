This bill provides statutory authority for all issuers of securities to use certain offering procedures that are available to emerging growth companies.

Specifically, the bill allows under statute issuers of securities to communicate with potential investors to ascertain interest in a contemplated securities offering, either before or after the filing of a registration statement (i.e., test the waters).

Additionally, issuers are allowed under statute to submit a confidential draft registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for review prior to public filing or within one year after the initial public offering or registration.</summary>
