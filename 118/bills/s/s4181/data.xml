This bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop and submit to Congress every three years a human capital operating plan to shape and improve FEMA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s workforce.

Specifically, the plan must include performance measures to track staffing and training, an analysis of the current workforce and possible gaps in staffing or skills,&#160;and a plan of action to address such gaps. The plan must discuss the membership and training of the Surge Capacity Force, through which federal employees deploy in response to a catastrophic disaster.

FEMA must submit the first plan within one year after the bill&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s enactment and subsequent plans at least once every three years.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to submit a report analyzing whether FEMA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s plan meets the requirements of the bill, including any recommendations to ensure subsequent plans meet the requirements.</summary>
