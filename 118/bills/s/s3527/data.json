(The SDR is an international reserve asset maintained by the IMF based on contributions from IMF member countries. SDRs may be exchanged between member countries and may also be exchanged for currencies.)\n\nTreasury must (1) vigorously advocate that each member of the IMF prohibit transactions of SDRs held by Iran, and (2) direct U.S. representatives to the IMF to use the voice and vote of the United States\u00a0to oppose any SDR allocation to Iran."
