This bill establishes the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National Monument in Illinois as a unit of the National Park System.

The monument shall

 preserve, protect, and interpret the resources associated with the Springfield Race Riot of 1908 and its role in the forming of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; and include the construction of a permanent memorial, within the boundary of the monument, to the victims, survivors, and descendants of survivors of the riot and to the Springfield community. The Department of the Interior may expend appropriated funds to acquire or lease essential facilities for the administration of the monument and visitor services outside the boundary, but within the vicinity of the monument.

Interior, using donated or appropriated funds, shall construct a memorial within the boundary of the monument.

The bill (1) establishes the Springfield 1908 Advisory Commission to advise Interior regarding the management and development of the monument, and (2) terminates the commission 12 years after this bill's enactment.

Interior shall consult with the commission on matters relating to the management and development of the monument.</summary>
