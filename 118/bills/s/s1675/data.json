Specifically, the bill amends Acer to require USDA to consider the information provided through consultation with the maple industry when making program grants.\n\nThe bill also extends the program's authorization through FY2028.\n\nThe Acer competitive grant program promotes the domestic maple syrup industry through activities associated with research and education related to maple syrup production, natural resource sustainability in the maple syrup industry, and the marketing of maple syrup and maple sap products. Acer also provides grants to encourage owners and operators of privately held land containing species of trees in the genus Acer to initiate or expand maple sugaring activities, or to voluntarily make the land publicly accessible for maple sugaring activities."
