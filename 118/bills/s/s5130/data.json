    "text": "Opioid Overdose Data Collection Enhancement Act\n\nThis bill expands the allowable uses of grants under the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program to include the adoption and implementation of an overdose data collection program to track fatal and nonfatal overdoses and the administration of opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., the\u00a0Overdose Detection\u00a0Mapping Application Program).\n\nSpecifically, the bill allows states, local governments, coalitions of law enforcement agencies, and Indian tribes to use these grants to develop and implement a data collection tool, including mobile data mapping applications.\u00a0The tool must allow these entities to easily and quickly track the locations of (1) suspected fatal and nonfatal overdoses, and (2) the administration of opioid overdose reversal medication by first responders.\n\nAn entity seeking to use a grant must first conduct an audit of available data and resources and submit the\u00a0audit with the grant application.\n\nGrant recipients must (1) support the development of coordinated public safety, behavioral health, and public health responses to the data collected by the tool; (2) focus on areas in which fatal and nonfatal overdoses occur and trends of concern; (3) provide for interoperability with existing overdose data collection tools; and (4) make data collected through the program available to federal, state, tribal, and territorial governments and coalitions of law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Department of Justice\u00a0must consult with agencies that maintain overdose data collection tools, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy."
