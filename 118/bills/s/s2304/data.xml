This bill expands the scope of grants that support the allied health workforce and grants that support health profession opportunities for those from disadvantaged backgrounds (i.e., the Health Careers Opportunity Program). Specifically, it expands these programs to expressly include dual or concurrent enrollment programs (i.e., programs that enable high school students to enroll in postsecondary courses and earn transferable credits that apply towards the completion of a postsecondary degree or recognized educational credential.)</summary>
