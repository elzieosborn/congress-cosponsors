In addition, air carriers in a partnership with certain educational institutions are eligible for aircraft pilot workforce grants.\n\nAmong other things, DOT must give priority to applicants that assure that grant funds will be used to encourage the participation of populations that are underrepresented in the aviation industry, including women, minorities, and individuals in economically disadvantaged geographic areas and rural communities."
