The bill also requires that not less than 90% of regular IRS employees perform work in person at their job sites.\n\nThe bill prohibits the IRS from auditing taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000 at a greater rate than before the enactment of this bill.\n\nFurther, the IRS may not hire additional personnel (other than for return processing activities and call center operations) until its tax return processing backlog is not in excess of 5 million cases and it issues tax refunds within 6 weeks or less after receipt of a tax return."
