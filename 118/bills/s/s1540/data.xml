  <summary date="2023-12-20T16:10:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill establishes circumstances under which reinitiation of consultation related to endangered or threatened species is not required under a land and resource management plan or a land use plan.

Specifically, the bill prohibits a land and resource management plan for a unit of the National Forest System or a land use plan for public lands from

 being considered to be a continuing federal agency action, or constituting a discretionary federal involvement or control for a distinct federal purpose. This makes certain consultation requirements related to endangered or threatened species inapplicable to such plans.</summary>
