This bill requires the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to undertake various activities to address mental and behavioral health issues among the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) populations.

Specifically, SAMHSA must develop and implement an outreach and education strategy to promote behavioral and mental health and reduce stigma associated with mental health conditions and substance abuse among AANHPI populations.

Additionally, SAMHSA must study (1) mental health and substance use disorders among AANHPI youth, including the number of individuals who attempted suicide or died by suicide or drug overdose; and (2) strategies for increasing AANHPI representation in the behavioral and mental health workforce.</summary>
