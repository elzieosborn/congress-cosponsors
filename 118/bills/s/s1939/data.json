The National Transportation Safety Board is also reauthorized through FY2028.\n\nThe bill also addresses a wide range of issues, including by\n\n expanding air traffic controller training capacity and requiring the FAA to update the training process for air traffic controllers and the FAA Contract Tower Program; requiring the FAA to operationalize key programs under the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) by December 31, 2025; requiring air carriers to provide a full refund, upon request, to passengers who hold a nonrefundable ticket for a cancelled or significantly delayed flight; requiring the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a policy directing certain air carriers to seat a young child next to an accompanying adult if adjacent seats are available without charging an additional fee; requiring DOT to issue rules on minimum training standards for airline personnel who assist wheelchair users; increasing the number of daily round-trip flights allowed at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA); establishing a new DOT grant program for airports to dispose of products that contain per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), such as certain firefighting equipment, and purchase fluorine-free firefighting alternatives; requiring the FAA to update safety standards for commercial air tour operators; and requiring the FAA to establish a regulatory pathway for the certification or approval of commercial unmanned aircraft (i.e., drones) to operate beyond the visual line of sight."
