In particular, DOJ may award a grant for (1) developing, implementing, and updating a process for collecting certain data regarding public defense attorneys and panel attorneys; or (2) hiring additional public defense attorneys and for other activities (e.g., increasing compensation or establishing a loan assistance program for public defenders).\n\nAdditionally, DOJ must award grants to eligible entities (e.g., certain tax-exempt organizations and states) to provide a comprehensive educational program to public defenders and panel attorneys that offers ongoing training, support, and programming.\n\nThe bill directs the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office for Access to Justice to conduct certain studies related to public defender and panel attorney caseloads and compensation.\n\nThe bill also authorizes DOJ to provide a state with an increase in Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program funds in order to collect and submit certain data related to the legal representation of defendants in criminal cases."
