This bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to&#160;limit the duration of an agreement that a ticket service provider may enter into with a venue for the exclusive right to conduct the initial sale of tickets to all, or substantially all, live concerts, theatrical performances, sporting events, comedy shows, or other scheduled performances held at that particular venue.

The&#160;FTC&#160;must issue regulations to define the period of time that constitutes an excessive&#160;duration for such an exclusivity agreement. However, the minimum period of time that constitutes an excessive duration must be more than four years.

The bill provides the FTC with authority to enforce this limitation.</summary>
