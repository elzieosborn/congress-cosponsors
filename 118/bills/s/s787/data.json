GAO must also make recommendations for any related legislative and administrative action.\n\nAs part of the study, GAO must assess\n\n the extent to which air carriers are preparing for weather events and natural disasters, as well as changing conditions, that may have an impact on air carriers' operational investments, staffing levels and safety policies, and mitigation strategies; how the Federal Aviation Administration oversees air carriers' operational resilience to these types of events; and steps the federal government and air carriers can take to improve their operational resilience."
