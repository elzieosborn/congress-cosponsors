This bill requires the Children's Bureau of the Office of the Administration for Children &amp; Families to provide states, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations with information, advice, educational materials, and technical assistance relating to eliminating obstacles to identifying and responding to reports of children missing from foster care and other vulnerable foster youth.

Specifically, the bureau must evaluate the protocols that states and tribes have developed to comply with the reporting requirements for locating children missing from foster care and identify the best practices for providing such children with effective interventions.

Additionally, the bureau must provide assistance for assessing and screening children who were missing and returned to foster care and children who are, or are at risk of, being victims of sex trafficking.</summary>
