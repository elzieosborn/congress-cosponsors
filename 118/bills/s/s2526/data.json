The office shall be headed by the Ambassador-at-Large for Press Freedom, who shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The State Department must ensure that there is a press freedom curriculum for the National Foreign Affairs Training Center to help Foreign Service officers better understand issues of press freedom and tools that are available to help protect journalists and promote freedom of the press norms. The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on the implementation of the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act of 2009, including how the State Department prepares information for the reports on press freedom that are required by that act."
