    "text": "Farmers Feeding America Act of 2023\n\nThis\u00a0bill reauthorizes The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP),\u00a0increases funding for the program,\u00a0and provides additional delivery options for geographically isolated states (i.e., Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam).\n\nTEFAP is a federal program that helps supplement the diets of people with low income by providing them with emergency food assistance at no cost. Through TEFAP, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) purchases a variety of commodities and makes those food products (e.g., canned, frozen, dried, and fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, meat, dairy, and whole-grain and enriched grain products) available to state distributing agencies.\n\nThe bill increases funding for purchasing commodities under\u00a0the program.\n\nFurther, the bill directs USDA to coordinate with geographically isolated states to (1) establish alternative delivery options for allocated commodities, and (2) allow for the states to order commodities through the\u00a0USDA Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program.\u00a0\n\nUSDA may also provide geographically isolated states the ability to directly purchase domestically grown food in lieu of receiving a portion of the commodities. Under this option, USDA may distribute as cash\u00a0to the state up to 20% of the cash value of the commodities that are allocated to the state under TEFAP.\u00a0\n\nFurther, USDA may consider additional factors beyond lowest price\u00a0in determining winning bids for contracts for fresh produce packages\u00a0(including product variety and transportation distance).\u00a0"
