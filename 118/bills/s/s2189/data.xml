This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to establish and maintain a publicly accessible and searchable database of fossil fuel-powered travel by the President, the Vice President, and political appointees where such travel is on official business or paid for by a third party if the individual is appearing in their official capacity.

The bill makes an exception where publishing on the database could be deemed a national security risk.</summary>
