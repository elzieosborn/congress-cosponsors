This bill imposes restrictions on the use of LOGINK, China's state-sponsored and state-supported logistics platform.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the Department of Defense from entering into or renewing contracts with entities that use (1) LOGINK, (2) any logistics platform associated with the Chinese government, or (3) any logistics platform that shares data with LOGINK or logistics platforms associated with the Chinese government. The bill requires the President to enter into negotiations with allies and partners (such as Japan, Australia, and NATO members) to prohibit entities in their countries from using any of these platforms.

Additionally, the bill requires the President to prohibit entities that own or operate a port (or any other critical infrastructure designated by the President) in the United States from using or sharing data with LOGINK or logistics platforms associated with the Chinese government.</summary>
