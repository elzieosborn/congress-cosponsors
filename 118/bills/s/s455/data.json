(The order restricts the entry of noncitizens who are not immigrants into the United States by air travel unless they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or otherwise attest that they will take public health measures to prevent the spread of the disease.)\n\nAdditionally, the bill nullifies the DHS order titled Notification of Temporary Travel Restrictions Applicable to Land Ports of Entry and Ferries Services Between the United States and Canada and published on April 22, 2022. (The order restricts the entry of noncitizens who are not immigrants along the United States-Canada border, including at ferry terminals, unless they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and can provide proof upon request.)\n\nThe bill also nullifies any successor or subsequent orders that require proof of a COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of entry into the United States and prohibits the use of federal funds to administer or enforce such requirements."
