This bill allows hemp and hemp-derived ingredients to be included in food and dietary supplements.

Current law prohibits, with limited exceptions, the sale of food and dietary supplements that contain an ingredient that is an active ingredient in (1) an approved drug, or (2) a drug for which there have been substantial and publicly known clinical investigations. This bill exempts hemp and hemp-derived ingredients, such as hemp-derived cannabidiol, from this prohibition.

The Food and Drug Administration may establish labeling and packaging requirements for such foods and dietary supplements.</summary>
