This bill prohibits grants that are awarded by the Health Resources and Services Administration through the Health Center Program from being used to provide an abortion unless the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother. (The Health Center Program supports the operations and activities of health centers that primarily provide preventative and primary care to low-income individuals and other medically underserved populations.)</summary>
