HHS exercised this authority as part of its COVID-19 response, including to allow for the expulsion of undocumented migrants at the border without any asylum processing.\n\nUnder this bill, HHS may not terminate the restrictions for (1) at least 60 days after it notifies Congress of the end of the COVID-19 emergency, and (2) at least 30 days after it submits to Congress a plan for addressing the possible influx of migrants or imports resulting from lifting the restrictions."
