This bill prohibits the Small Business Administration (SBA) from discharging, suspending, or ending collection action on any claim related to a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan or Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL).

Additionally, the SBA must refer such claims that are for $100,000 or less to the Department of the Treasury and Treasury must make a final decision for the disposition of such claims.

The SBA must provide monthly briefings to, and the SBA Administrator must annually testify before, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives about the collection of claims for such loans.</summary>
