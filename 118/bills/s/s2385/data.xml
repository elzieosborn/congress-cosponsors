This bill expands access to water resources for Native communities (i.e., Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian communities).

Specifically, the bill&#160;allows the Department of Agriculture to make or insure loans and make grants to eligible entities (e.g., Native communities) for technical assistance to develop, use, and control water.

Additionally, the bill allows the Indian Health Service to (1) provide and maintain essential sanitation facilities to community structures (e.g., schools, hospitals, and tribal offices), (2) provide technical assistance, and (3) provide financial assistance to operate and maintain water facilities that serve Native communities.The bill also increases the authorization of appropriations for the Native American Affairs Technical Assistance Program through FY2028.</summary>
