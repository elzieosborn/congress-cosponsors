(Currently, a state agency may allow for a telephonic signature through a recorded verbal assent.)\n\nThe bill also specifies that, for a video phone or telephonic signature, the current recording system requirement may be satisfied through an audio recording or in writing. (During 2020 and 2021, the Food and Nutrition Service provided waivers to certain state agencies which allowed the state agency to document in writing that an applicant verbally signed the application, instead of requiring an audio recording.)"
