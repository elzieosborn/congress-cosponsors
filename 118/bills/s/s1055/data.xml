  <summary date="2023-12-18T17:49:27Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Airport Infrastructure Resilience Act of 2023

This bill requires the Department of Transportation to establish a pilot program to provide infrastructure grants to airport sponsors. These competitive grants seek to incentivize the planning, design, and construction of projects that improve infrastructure that is subject to current or future long-term risks with respect to

 changing conditions, such as sea level rise or permafrost thaw; or weather events and natural disasters, such as severe storms, flooding, drought, rockslides, extreme weather, and earthquakes. Funding may be provided for (1) new projects, (2) improvements to existing infrastructure, and (3) the purchase of monitoring equipment or services.

The bill requires that a portion of the grant funds go to sponsors of regional airports (i.e., small hub, nonhub, nonprimary, and reliever airports).</summary>
