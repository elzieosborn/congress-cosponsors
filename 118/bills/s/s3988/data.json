    "text": "Getting Rid of Abusive Trust Schemes Act or the GRATS Act\n\nThis bill imposes new requirements on grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) to discourage tax avoidance schemes by wealthy taxpayers. Specifically, such trusts must have a minimum term of 15 years and a maximum term of the life expectancy of the annuitant plus 10 years. The bill also prohibits any decrease in a GRAT during its term and requires that the remainder interests in such trusts at the time of their transfer must have a minimum value for gift tax purposes.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also treats a transfer of property between a GRAT and its deemed owner as a sale or exchange for income tax purposes, with specified exceptions.\n\nThe bill designates any income tax paid on the income of a GRAT as a gift for purposes of the gift tax unless the owner of the trust is reimbursed during the same calendar year. The amount of the gift may not be reduced through the use of certain deductions, including the charitable or marital deduction, or gifts of tuition or medical care.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
