This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor to jointly report on existing grant programs that support the nurse workforce.

The report must include recommendations on how to change the grant programs to (1) increase nurse faculty in underserved areas, (2) provide more pathways for experienced nurses to become faculty at schools of nursing, and (3) support pathways for licensed practical nurses to become registered nurses.</summary>
