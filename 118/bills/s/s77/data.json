The SBA must collect data on certain performance metrics such as the (1) total number of small businesses assisted by the program, (2) total dollar amount of export sales by participating small businesses, and (3) number of small businesses that have created new jobs through their participation in the program.\n\nThe bill also requires applicants for participation to include a budget plan that outlines their intended use of funds awarded under the program."
