    "text": "National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2024\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2028 the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and expands the activities federal agencies must conduct under the program, including activities relating to secondary effects of earthquakes and post-earthquake infrastructure performance.\u00a0\n\nNEHRP is a coordinated earthquake hazards reduction program of four federal agencies: the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Science Foundation. Under NEHRP, these agencies are required to conduct various activities relating to earthquakes, including advancing warning systems, hazard reduction measures, and research to improve understanding of earthquakes and their effects.\n\nThe bill expands the scope of the activities under NEHRP, including requiring the agencies to\u00a0\n\nimprove understanding of and develop resilience measures for secondary effects and multiple hazards associated with earthquakes, such as tsunamis and fires;increase post-earthquake functional recovery, which means maintaining or restoring the pre-earthquake functionality of buildings and lifeline infrastructure systems (e.g., infrastructure for water, electricity, and transportation); andassist public entities with developing an inventory, and conducting seismic performance evaluation, of infrastructure with high seismic risk.\u00a0Additionally, the bill specifically includes tribal governments in the activities conducted under NEHRP."
