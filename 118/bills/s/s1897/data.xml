This bill requires and authorizes actions related to the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles crossing the border from the United States to Mexico.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must, to the extent practicable, ensure that 20% of such outbound vehicles are inspected. DHS may use various means to meet this requirement, including nonintrusive imaging.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must hire at least 500 new officers to inspect pedestrians and vehicles crossing the border to Mexico. The CBP may also hire support staff and purchase equipment to assist with such inspections.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) must hire at least 100 new Homeland Security Investigations special agents to investigate the smuggling of currency and firearms from the United States to Mexico. ICE may also hire support staff to support these special agents.

The bill also requires reports to Congress on various issues addressed in this bill, including quarterly reports on currency, firearms, and ammunition seized from outbound inspections along the southern border.</summary>
