This bill designates nine specified drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. (Among other things, such a designation allows the Department of the Treasury to require financial institutions to block transactions involving the organization.)

The bill also requires the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to establish an interagency task force on combating Mexican cartels and other transnational criminal organizations.</summary>
