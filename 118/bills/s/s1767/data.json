Recipients may also use funds for safety measures to protect health care workers from hazards (e.g., alternative transit options and personal protective equipment).\n\nEssential health care workers include health care providers, public health workers, janitorial staff in health care settings, and other roles essential to the care of patients or maintenance of public health that cannot be conducted remotely."
