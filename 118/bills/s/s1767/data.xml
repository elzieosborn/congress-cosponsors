This bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to public or private nonprofit health care facilities and home health agencies for providing hazard pay to essential health care workers during a declared emergency or disaster in which the work or commute is hazardous. Recipients may also use funds for safety measures to protect health care workers from hazards (e.g., alternative transit options and personal protective equipment).

Essential health care workers include health care providers, public health workers, janitorial staff in health care settings, and other roles essential to the care of patients or maintenance of public health that cannot be conducted remotely.</summary>
