This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collect and disseminate information about diagnosing, treating, and preventing concussions and traumatic brain injuries among public safety officers.

The CDC must put the information it collects on its website. The CDC must also disseminate the information to medical and public health professionals, public safety employers and employee representatives, and other stakeholders.

In implementing the bill, the CDC may support public and private efforts to identify and create guidelines, protocols, and evidence-based practices for treating concussions and traumatic brain injuries in public safety officers.</summary>
