(Some providers began offering carryout meals to seniors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n\nFurther, the bill permits the Administration on Aging to establish and operate, through grants to or contracts with eligible entities, a national resource center to support growth of the direct care workforce. The center\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities may include the provision of training and technical assistance and the promotion of strategies to recruit and retain direct care workers.\u00a0\n\nFinally, the bill establishes or reconvenes certain advisory groups, including (1) an advisory committee to provide guidance regarding the needs of older Native Americans and the implementation of related programs, and (2) a White House Conference on Aging to recommend improvements to federal programs that serve older individuals."
