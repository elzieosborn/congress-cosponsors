    "text": "Protecting Equal Opportunity from ESG Act\n\nThis bill prohibits racial hiring quotas by federal contractors.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires each executive agency to take steps to ensure that each contract entered into by the agency includes requirements that the contractor\n\n certify that, during the five-year period immediately preceding the date on which the contract is entered into, the contractor did not initiate, carry out, or enforce any system of quotas, benchmarks, or goals regarding employment practices that encourage or require discrimination on the basis of race; and not, during the performance of the contract, initiate, carry out, or enforce any such system. The bill makes an exception where the Department of Labor determines that special circumstances in the national interest so require.\n\nLabor shall have the authority to investigate potential violations and obtain compliance. The bill establishes penalties for noncompliance."
