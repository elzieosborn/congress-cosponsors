This bill directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to establish a program to support state and local governments in the transition to ranked choice voting (a system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference).

Specifically, the EAC must provide technical assistance to state and local governments that are considering whether to make, or that are in the process of making, the transition to a ranked choice voting system for their elections.

The EAC must also award grants to support such transition, including through the acquisition of voting equipment and tabulation software, appropriate ballot design, educational materials, and voter outreach.</summary>
