This bill requires certain digital advertising platforms to annually report to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) about their free public service advertising, with a particular focus on advertisements for mental, behavioral, and physical health resources. Additionally, the FTC must provide Congress with a summary of the reported information.

The reporting requirement applies to social media platforms, search engines or other public-facing websites, online services, and applications that sell digital advertising space and have more than 100 million unique monthly users.</summary>
