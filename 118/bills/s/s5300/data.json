NASA currently operates a water treatment system to remove PFAS from the affected water supply.)\u00a0\n\nAny such agreement must include, to the extent practicable, (1) a provision for the removal and relocation of the wells remaining on NASA property, (2) a description of the location to which the wells are planned to be relocated, and (3) a current cost estimate of such relocation. Replacement wells must be established on property under the administrative control of the town of Chincoteague.\u00a0"
