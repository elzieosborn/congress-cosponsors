  <summary date="2025-08-27T14:59:32Z" status="Passed Senate">This bill reauthorizes the Marine Debris Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through FY2028.

The mission of the Marine Debris Program is to investigate and prevent the adverse impacts of marine debris on the U.S. economy, the marine environment, and navigation safety. Under current law,&#160;marine debris includes any manufactured or processed persistent solid material that is disposed of or abandoned into the marine environment or the Great Lakes (directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally).</summary>
