The state-inspected meat and poultry products must be shipped directly to household consumers and in normal retail quantities (e.g., do not exceed 300 pounds for beef, 100 pounds for pork, and 27.5 pounds for lamb).\n\n(Under the inspection programs, the Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service allows states that meet certain requirements to inspect meat and poultry. The state-inspected products are currently limited to intrastate commerce, unless a state opts into a separate Cooperative Interstate Shipment Program.)\u00a0"
