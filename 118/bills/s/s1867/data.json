Under the bill, childcare includes eligible programs that provide quality care and early education for young children who are in kindergarten or have not yet entered kindergarten.\n\nUnder the initiative, USDA must give priority to applicants that propose to use certain\u00a0loans or grants to address the availability, quality, or costs of childcare in an agricultural or\u00a0rural community.\u00a0In addition, USDA must\u00a0prioritize communities in farming-dependent counties and ensure a balanced geographical distribution of the benefits.\n\nUSDA must conduct a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the projects carried out under the initiative and submit a report to Congress.\u00a0"
