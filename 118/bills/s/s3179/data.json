    "text": "Stop Woke Investing Act\n\nThis bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to amend regulations to limit the inclusion of shareholder proposals in proxy statements. A proxy statement is provided to shareholders prior to a public company holding a shareholder meeting and contains information relevant to a shareholder vote. Under current SEC rules, certain qualifying shareholder proposals must be included on a company's proxy statement, including proposals that raise significant social policy issues.\n\nUnder the bill, a shareholder proposal must have a material effect on the financial performance of the company to be included in a proxy statement. The bill also establishes a cap on the number of shareholder proposals required to be included with respect to a shareholder meeting depending on the size and type of the company. In addition, a proposal submitted by a member of the board of directors is prohibited from inclusion."
