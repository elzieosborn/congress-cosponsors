Specifically, these procedures shall cover repair and maintenance projects at federally owned ports of entry that engage in certain activities, such as entry inspections and activities to prevent the entry of illicit drugs, agricultural pests, and contraband. The procedures shall cover projects that cost no more than $300,000, with this cap to be adjusted annually for inflation.

CBP may perform such repair and maintenance projects in accordance with the procedures established under this bill.</summary>
