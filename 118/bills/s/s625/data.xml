This bill modifies provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to whistleblower protections. Specifically, the bill

 revises the standard for review of whistleblower awards in the Tax Court to require a de novo review standard (currently, the standard is abuse of discretion); exempts whistleblower awards from reductions due to budget sequestration; allows whistleblowers anonymity in proceedings before the Tax Court; modifies the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) whistleblower report to require inclusion of a list and description of the top 10 tax avoidance schemes disclosed by whistleblowers; requires the IRS to pay interest on whistleblower awards if not paid within one year of receipt of proceeds collected from whistleblower disclosures; and allows payment of the attorney fees of whistleblowers regardless of whether the whistleblower award was paid through the mandatory or the discretionary whistleblower award program.</summary>
