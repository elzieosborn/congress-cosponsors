  <summary date="2024-11-26T17:22:13Z" status="Passed House">Overtime Pay for Protective Services Act of 2023

This bill extends through 2028 and modifies the authority to provide premium pay for protective services employees of the U.S. Secret Service that exceeds certain statutory limits on premium pay. The bill also requires the Secret Service to provide related information to Congress.

The bill provides that, if the bill is enacted after December 31, 2023, the extension applies as if it were enacted on December 31, 2023. The bill also specifies that employees who perform routine administrative or technical work are not eligible for this premium pay.

Next, within 180 days of the bill's enactment, the Secret Service must report to Congress on how it is addressing the demand for Secret Service protection personnel and recommend strategies for reducing the use of overtime.

The bill also requires the Secret Service to report to Congress (1) the number of employees receiving premium pay above the statutory cap; (2) the number of employees who were not fully compensated due to the statutory cap and the total amount that employees would have been paid without the cap; (3) the total, median, mean, and greatest amounts of premium pay above the cap; and (4) a list of personnel who received premium pay above the cap and separated from the agency. This information must be provided for each calendar year and updated quarterly. Further, the Secret Service must report to Congress on the effect that the bill has had on this data.</summary>
