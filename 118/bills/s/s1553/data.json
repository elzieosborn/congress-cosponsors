The bill allocates income generated by that investment to rangeland improvement projects and enhancing, expanding, or improving access to public lands or National Forest System land to benefit hunting and recreation activities.\n\nThe bill increases the maximum duration of grazing permits and leases from 10 years to 20 years."
