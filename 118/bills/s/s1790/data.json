This clawback requirement applies to an entity (including a director, shareholder, or other person who participates in the conduct of the institution's affairs) that caused more than a minimal financial loss to, or a significant adverse effect on, the insured depository institution. The compensation subject to the clawback requirement includes salary, bonuses, awards, and any profits realized from the buying or selling of securities during the preceding three years.\n\nThe bill also expands the authority of the FDIC to claw back compensation of parties responsible for financial losses incurred by a financial company regardless of the process by which it is appointed receiver."
