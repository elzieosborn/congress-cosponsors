Venture capital funds are exempt from certain regulations applicable to other investment firms, including those related to filings, audits, and restricted communications with investors. Currently, an investment firm qualifies as a venture capital fund if, among other requirements (1) the fund's securities are owned by 250 persons or less, and (2) the fund has $10 million or less in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital. The bill increases these amounts to 500 persons and $50 million, respectively."
