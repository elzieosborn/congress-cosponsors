This bill reauthorizes counter-drone authorities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ)&#160;through FY2025.

Under current law,&#160;DHS and&#160;DOJ have limited authority to protect certain covered facilities and assets from threats posed by drones. Covered facilities and assets include those related to U.S. Customs and Border Protection functions, U.S. Secret Service protection operations, Federal Bureau of Investigation activities, and operations of the U.S. Marshals Service.

This authority allows DHS and DOJ to

detect, identify, monitor, and track drones;warn drone operators;disrupt or take control of drones;seize, exercise control of, or otherwise confiscate a drone; anduse reasonable force to disable, damage, or destroy drones deemed to pose a threat.</summary>
