Similarly, the discard date on a food label (i.e., the date after which the item should not be consumed) must include the phrase USE By or the abbreviation UB. Abbreviations may only be used if the full phrase does not fit on the label.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture may specify alternative phrases through regulations."
