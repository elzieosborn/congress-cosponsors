This bill establishes requirements for the format of quality date and discard date labels on food packaging.

Specifically, the bill requires the quality date on a food label (i.e., the date after which the quality of the item may deteriorate) to include the phrase BEST If Used By or the abbreviation BB. Similarly, the discard date on a food label (i.e., the date after which the item should not be consumed) must include the phrase USE By or the abbreviation UB. Abbreviations may only be used if the full phrase does not fit on the label.

The Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture may specify alternative phrases through regulations.</summary>
