  <summary date="2023-11-27T12:59:23Z" status="Passed Senate">This bill extends the deadlines for the Department of the Interior to issue proposed and final regulations pursuant to negotiated rulemaking for the Tribal Self-Governance Program. (The PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act, which was signed into law on October 21, 2020, revised Interior's process for approving self-governance compacts and funding agreements with tribes. This act authorized a negotiated rulemaking committee to negotiate and promulgate regulations for its implementation.)

Under current law, Interior must submit proposed regulations for the program within 21 months and final regulations within 30 months of October 21, 2020. This bill extends those deadlines to 38 months and 50 months, respectively.</summary>
