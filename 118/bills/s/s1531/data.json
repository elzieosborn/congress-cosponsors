The team must also develop a geographic information system for monitoring the Northern Rockies Bioregion and assess the potential for facilitating wildlife movement across or under major highways and rail lines within the biological corridors established by the bill.\n\nThe bill provides for the temporary closure to the general public of specific portions of protected areas, at the request of an Indian tribe, to protect the privacy of a religious activity or cultural use by an Indian."
