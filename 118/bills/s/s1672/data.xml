This bill requires officers and employees of the legislative and executive branches to disclose communications with providers of interactive computer services (e.g., internet service providers) regarding restricting speech.

Specifically, executive and legislative branch officers and employees must disclose their communications with a provider or operator of an interactive computer service regarding action to restrict access to material posted by another information content provider. The bill makes exceptions for legitimate law enforcement and national security purposes.

The disclosure must be made within seven days of the date on which the communication is made.

The bill establishes penalties for violations.</summary>
