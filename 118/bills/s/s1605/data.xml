This bill addresses data collection, public education, workplace safety, and other matters related to maternal health during public health emergencies.

Specifically, the bill supports (1) various programs and initiatives carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collect data about maternal health, including racial, ethnic, and other demographic data; and (2) research activities of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Additionally, the CDC and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must make publicly available and periodically update pregnancy and postpartum data that is collected through federal surveillance systems during public health emergencies. The data must be disaggregated by factors such as race, ethnicity, insurance status, and location.

Further, the CDC must carry out a program to educate pregnant individuals, their employers, and their health care providers about maternal and infant health risks during public health emergencies.

The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to convene a task force to develop recommendations on the provision of maternity care during public health emergencies with a particular focus on communities of color and rural populations.</summary>
