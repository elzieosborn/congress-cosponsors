The data must be disaggregated by factors such as race, ethnicity, insurance status, and location.\n\nFurther, the CDC must carry out a program to educate pregnant individuals, their employers, and their health care providers about maternal and infant health risks during public health emergencies.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to convene a task force to develop recommendations on the provision of maternity care during public health emergencies with a particular focus on communities of color and rural populations."
