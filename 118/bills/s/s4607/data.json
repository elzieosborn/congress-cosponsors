    "text": "America's National Churchill Museum National Historic Landmark Act\n\nThis bill designates the America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Churchill Museum, including the Winston Churchill Memorial, located at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, as the America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Churchill Museum National Historic Landmark. (Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave a speech titled The Sinews of Peace, also widely known as the Iron Curtain Speech, at the college in 1946.)\n\nThe bill permits the Department of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with public and private entities for the purposes of protecting historic resources at the landmark and providing educational and interpretive facilities for the public. Interior may provide technical and financial assistance to partner entities.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also directs Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the national significance of the landmark and to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating it as a unit of the National Park System. The study must consider alternatives to that designation for the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the landmark, and must include cost estimates associated with identified alternatives."
