    "text": "Satellite Cybersecurity Act\n\nThis bill requires the dissemination of information and other activities to address cybersecurity risks to commercial satellite systems.\n\nSpecifically, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) must (1) maintain a publicly available clearinghouse of resources concerning the cybersecurity of commercial satellite systems; and (2) consolidate voluntary recommendations for developing, maintaining, and operating those systems, including recommendations for protecting systems against cyber-related risks and attacks. To the extent practicable, CISA must implement these activities as a public-private partnership.\n\nIn addition, the National Space Council and the White House Office of the National Cyber Director must develop a national strategy for addressing and improving the cybersecurity of commercial satellite systems.\n\nFurther, the Government Accountability Office must report on federal actions to support and improve the cybersecurity of commercial satellite systems, including actions taken to address the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure sectors. The report must cover, among other topics, the effectiveness of those actions and the reliance of federal agencies on commercial satellite systems (particularly those with ties to foreign countries)."
