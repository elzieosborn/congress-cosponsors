    "text": "Election Mail Act\n\nThis bill addresses the delivery and processing of election mail for federal elections, including by establishing certain standards for mail-in ballots.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to\n\n ensure (to the maximum extent practicable) same-day processing of mail-in ballots, postmark each ballot, carry election mail (e.g., voter registration applications and mail-in ballots) as first-class mail that is free of postage, appoint an election mail coordinator at each area office and district office, and consult annually with Indian tribes regarding barriers to voting for eligible voters living on Indian lands. The bill prohibits the USPS, within 120 days of a federal election, from making any operational change that would restrict the prompt and reliable delivery of election mail.\n\nEach state and jurisdiction must provide with each mail-in ballot a return envelope with an intelligent mail barcode. This requirement does not apply to a state or jurisdiction that uses an alternative system that enables voters to track the ballot through the mail.\n\nThe bill requires election officials to count mail-in ballots that are postmarked by election day and arrive within seven days after the election."
