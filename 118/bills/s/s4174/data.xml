This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish an online clearinghouse of resources and other information for individuals with an intellectual disability (and their caregivers and families) that is searchable by zip code. In particular, the clearinghouse must include information about (1) community-based services and long-term support services available through Medicaid; and (2) how to obtain health care, mental health care, and other relevant services.

HHS must also promote awareness of the resources in the clearinghouse.</summary>
