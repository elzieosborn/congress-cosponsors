The bill requires that the VA provide\u00a0such notifications to individuals who are being reassessed for eligibility to continue in the program. Additionally, the bill requires that such notifications include all criteria used to determine eligibility for assistance and how the criteria were used to evaluate information provided in assessments to determine eligibility.\n\nThe bill also requires the VA to report annually on the program.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the VA to establish a process through which it may recognize organizations and individuals to assist veterans, their family members, or caregivers, in navigating the programs and services of the Veterans Health Administration. The VA must solicit feedback and recommendations from relevant organizations in the creation of such a process. In order to be recognized under the established process, individuals and organizations must certify that no fee or compensation will be charged to individuals for the provision of assistance."
