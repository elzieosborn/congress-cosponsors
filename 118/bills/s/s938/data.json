The fund may be used for specified grant programs. The bill increases the corporate income tax rate to 24.5% to provide revenues for the fund.\n\nIn addition, the bill revises requirements concerning the clean water state revolving fund (SRF) and the drinking water SRF, including by prohibiting states from providing financial assistance using amounts from the clean water SRF for projects that will provide substantial direct benefits to new communities other than projects for constructing an advanced decentralized wastewater system.\n\nIt also creates or reauthorizes several grant programs related to water infrastructure, such as grants for removing lead from drinking water."
