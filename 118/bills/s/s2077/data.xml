This bill specifies that agricultural producers who rely on acequia systems are eligible to receive assistance under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program for all losses suffered as a result of drought, flood, or other natural disasters. Acequias, or community ditches, are community-operated and -organized water irrigation systems.&#160;

The bill also provides that a special use permit shall not be required on Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Department of the Interior land for the (1) presence or use of&#160;an acequia&#160;or the use of the acequia's water,&#160;or (2) routine maintenance and minor improvements conducted by a community user or governing body of an acequia.

Further, USDA must submit a report to Congress on agricultural producers who&#160;rely on&#160;acequia systems.&#160;</summary>
