This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to hold national hearings to review Federal Milk Marketing Orders. (USDA uses these orders to establish a minimum price for various classes of milk.) The hearings must include the review of proposals from producers and the dairy industry on the price of Class I skim milk.

The bill also requires manufacturers to report cost and yield information for all dairy products processed in the same facility or facilities to USDA's Dairy Product Mandatory Reporting Program. Further, every two years, USDA must publish a report containing the information obtained under these new requirements.</summary>
