    "text": "Save Our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act\n\nThis bill expands the administrative requirements of the Marine Debris Program and the Marine Debris Foundation. Both the program and the foundation work to remove, reduce, and prevent marine debris on oceans, waterways, and the Great Lakes.\n\nFirst, the bill modifies the program to allow the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to (1) enter into other agreements, outside of contracts; and (2) make in-kind contributions for certain projects in an amount that represents the benefit\u00a0NOAA derives from the project.\n\nNext, the bill modifies the requirements for the foundation, including by modifying the process for approving or removing members of the foundation's board of directors. It directs\u00a0NOAA to obtain the approval from the Department of Commerce before appointing or removing a member of the foundation's board of directors. The bill expands the list of governmental entities that NOAA must consult with before removing a board member to include the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe board must\u00a0appoint and review the performance of a chief executive officer (CEO) for the foundation. The board may also remove the CEO.\n\nThe bill also directs the foundation to locate its principal office in the National Capital Region or a city or county directly adjacent to the open ocean, a major estuary, or one of the Great Lakes.\n\nThe foundation must also develop best practices for conducting outreach to Indian tribes.\n\nThe bill expands existing matching fund sources to allow the\u00a0foundation to match contributions made to the foundation, or recipients of the foundation's grants, by nongovernmental organizations, regional organizations, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and foreign government entities.\u00a0"
