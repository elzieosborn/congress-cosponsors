Funds from the grants must be used for related purposes, such as (1) the purchase or rental of fishing equipment; (2) fees for boats, piers, or other facilities; (3) fishing licenses; and (4) fishing guide costs. In awarding such grants, NOAA must prioritize proposals for projects focused on underserved communities. NOAA must also provide technical assistance related to the youth fishing projects.\n\nThe bill also requires NOAA to report to Congress regarding (1) the entities that were awarded grants, (2) the amount of funds disbursed, and (3) the activities and number of participants funded by the grants."
