This bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a grant program to support youth fishing projects.

Under the program, NOAA must award grants to nonprofit organizations; educational institutions; state, local, or tribal governments; or Native Hawaiian organizations for conducting youth fishing projects. Funds from the grants must be used for related purposes, such as (1) the purchase or rental of fishing equipment; (2) fees for boats, piers, or other facilities; (3) fishing licenses; and (4) fishing guide costs. In awarding such grants, NOAA must prioritize proposals for projects focused on underserved communities. NOAA must also provide technical assistance related to the youth fishing projects.

The bill also requires NOAA to report to Congress regarding (1) the entities that were awarded grants, (2) the amount of funds disbursed, and (3) the activities and number of participants funded by the grants.</summary>
