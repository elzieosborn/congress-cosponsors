This bill establishes the Interagency Group on Large-Scale Carbon Management within the National Science and Technology Council to plan and oversee efforts to (1) remove carbon dioxide from the air, ocean, and land; and (2) store such carbon.

The interagency group must develop a strategic plan for federal research, development, and demonstration of technological carbon dioxide removal and storage.

In addition, the interagency group must establish working groups to carry out a Carbon Removal Initiative that pursues such research, development, and demonstration across several federal agencies.</summary>
