  <summary date="2023-12-26T23:26:32Z" status="Public Law">Duck Stamp Modernization Act of 2023

This act modifies provisions regarding the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp, commonly referred to as the duck stamp, including to allow an individual to be carrying an electronic stamp, rather than a paper stamp, at the time of taking waterfowl.

The act requires states to issue electronic stamps at the time of purchase and the Department of the Interior to issue a paper stamp after March 10 each year to each individual who purchased an electronic stamp for the preceding waterfowl season. The electronic stamps are valid through the first June 30 after issuance.</summary>
