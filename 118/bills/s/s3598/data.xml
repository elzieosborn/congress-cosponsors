This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a standard for timing between the date on which a referral for VA care is entered into the VA's system and the date on which an appointment for care occurs, whether at a VA facility or through care in the community.

The VA must publish the standard in the Federal Register and on a publicly accessible VA website. Additionally, the VA must submit a report at least quarterly on the number and percentage of referrals that meet the new timing standard.</summary>
