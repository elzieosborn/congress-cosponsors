  <summary date="2025-08-18T19:34:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Invent Here, Make Here Act of 2023

This bill (1) modifies the licensing&#160;requirements with respect to&#160;inventions developed with federal funds, and (2) requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to&#160;coordinate with other agencies to support the&#160;domestic&#160;development of commercial products based on research conducted by federal agencies.

Generally, subject to individual waivers, the licensing for inventions developed with federal funds requires that the manufacture of products embodying or using such inventions occurs substantially in the United States. The bill (1) prohibits waivers of this requirement with respect to countries of concern (North Korea, China, Russia, Iran, or a country determined to be engaged in conduct detrimental to U.S. security), and (2) requires any such waiver to comply with the procedures established by the Made in America Office.</summary>
