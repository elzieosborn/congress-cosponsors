This bill makes changes to the Charter Schools Program (CSP).&#160;

Specifically, the bill allows state entities (e.g., state educational agencies and state charter school boards) to use up to 5% of their CSP grant funds to make pre-charter planning subgrants to prospective charter applicants (or nonprofit or public entities that will support prospective applicants).

Currently, state entities must use at least 7% of their CSP grant funds to provide technical assistance to eligible applicants and authorized public chartering agencies. The bill instead allows state entities to use not more than 10% of these funds for technical assistance.</summary>
