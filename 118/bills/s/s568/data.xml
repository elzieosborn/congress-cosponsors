This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to ensure that the face of all $20 federal reserve notes printed after December 31, 2030, bear the likeness of Harriet Tubman. Treasury may delay this date by two years if the earlier deadline creates an unacceptable risk (1) of counterfeiting; or (2) to the safe, secure, and speedy functioning of the United States economy.</summary>
