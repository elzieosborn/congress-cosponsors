This bill establishes parental notification requirements for social media companies that allow minors to create accounts.

Specifically, the bill requires a social media company to (1) collect contact information of a parent or guardian at the time a minor child creates an account, and (2) notify a parent or guardian when a minor child creates an account.

It authorizes a civil action against a social media company that fails to provide, upon request, access to the minor's usage data or the ability to delete a minor's account and associated data.</summary>
