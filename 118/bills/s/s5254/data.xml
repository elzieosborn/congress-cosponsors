  <summary date="2024-10-23T15:32:17Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Child Care for American Families Act&#160;

This bill increases and revises the employer-provided child care tax credit. It increases the rate of such credit from 25% to 40% (50% for certain small businesses and 60% for child care facilities located in an eligible census track).

The bill increases the limitation on the dollar amount of the credit to $1.2 million in any taxable year and imposes a $2 million limit on the aggregate amount of child care expenditures that may be taken into account for purposes of calculating the credit.&#160;

The bill directs the Internal Revenue Service to issue guidance regarding multi-employer facilities and to establish a public awareness program to inform taxpayers about the availability of the child care credit and filing procedures for such credit.&#160;</summary>
