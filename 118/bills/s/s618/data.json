Such areas include terrestrial, coastal, and marine-protected or conserved parks, conservancies, and reserves. Projects must be cost-matched from sources other than the U.S. government.\n\nProject grants shall focus on countries that (1) have low-income, lower middle-income, or upper-middle-income economies; (2) have a high degree of biological diversity or important species or ecosystems; and (3) have demonstrated a commitment to conservation through their actions.\n\nThe foundation may not provide support for any government, or any entity owned or controlled by a government, that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism or has engaged in a consistent pattern of gross human rights violations. Additionally, the foundation may not engage in any dealings prohibited under U.S. sanctions."
