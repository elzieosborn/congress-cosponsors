This bill requires certain actions regarding institutions of higher education (IHEs) and the management of their assets.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education to annually update the College Navigator website with information on the assets of IHEs, including information about investments with minority- or women-owned firms.

The bill also requires the Minority Business Development Agency to (1) report on recommended changes for substantially increasing the use of minority- or women-owned firms in the investment and bond transactions of IHEs, and (2) convene a conference every two years.</summary>
