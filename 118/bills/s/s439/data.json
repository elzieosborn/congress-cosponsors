Specifically, the bill allows for sales by current Members during the 180 days following the bill's enactment and for sales by future Members during the 180 days following the commencement of their service.\n\nAny profit made in violation of the prohibition must be disgorged to the Treasury and may subject the Member to a civil fine.\n\nEach Member must submit an annual certification of compliance, and the Government Accountability Office must audit Members' compliance with the bill's provisions."
