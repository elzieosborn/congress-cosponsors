  <summary date="2024-01-11T20:50:42Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Agriculture PFAS Liability Protection Act of 2023

This bill exempts producers and harvesters of agricultural products from liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) for the release of certain perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS. However, liability for damages or costs associated with the release of certain PFAS must not be precluded if an entity acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.

PFAS are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.</summary>
