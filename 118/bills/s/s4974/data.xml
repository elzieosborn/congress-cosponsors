  <summary date="2025-08-25T16:19:56Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill reauthorizes through FY2033 the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System. (The system, operated by the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], monitors volcanoes in the United States to improve hazard forecasts and reduce risk to communities within their reach.)

The bill also establishes an implementation committee to provide the USGS with recommendations, implementation steps, and performance standards for the system. The committee must include representatives from state partners, institutions of higher education, and U.S. volcano observatories.

Further, the bill requires the USGS to update its management plan for the system at least every five years, and to include any new or existing cooperative agreements in the plan.&#160;

Finally, the bill adds the Forest Service as a coordinating agency for the system.</summary>
