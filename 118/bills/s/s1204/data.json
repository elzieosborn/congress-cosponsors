These authorizations expire after five years.\n\nThe bill also requires the VA to report on (1) the use of medical marijuana by veterans to manage pain and to treat diseases and disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder); and (2) the relationship between state-approved medical marijuana treatment programs, program access, and opioid use and misuse reduction."
