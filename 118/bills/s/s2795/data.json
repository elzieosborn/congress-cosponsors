Under the act, this period of relief for those affected by a closure or disapproval is extended by two years to apply to programs that close or discontinue before September 30, 2025.\n\nThe act extends through FY2028 the authorization for VA emergency preparedness for public health emergencies.\n\nThe act also extends the applicability of certain loan fee rates through November 15, 2031, under the VA's home loan program."
