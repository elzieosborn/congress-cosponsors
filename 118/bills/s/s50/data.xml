This act revises the National Estuary Program to require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to give priority consideration to selecting the Pensacola and Perdido Bays in Florida as estuaries of national significance. Under the existing program, the EPA protects and restores the water quality and ecological integrity of estuaries of national significance.

The EPA may not use any amounts appropriated to carry out the national estuary program for the Pensacola and Perdido Bays (1) in FY2024, nor (2) in FY2025 unless the total amount appropriated to carry out the program for FY2025 is at least $850,000 more than the total amount appropriated to carry out that program for FY2023.</summary>
