Specifically, the bill provides such entitlement to members who, during active service, were deployed during specified time frames in certain locations where burn pits are or were used (e.g., Iraq from August 2, 1990, to February 28, 1991). A burn pit is an area used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment."
