This bill excludes from gross income, for income tax purposes, post-graduation scholarship grants. The bill defines a post-graduation scholarship grant as any grant program that is established by a tax-exempt organization that, among other things, repays a portion of a student's education loan.&#160;

To be eligible for these grants, a grant recipient must live and work in a community that has a bachelor's degree attainment rate below the state or national average. &#160;</summary>
