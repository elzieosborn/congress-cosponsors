Compensation includes salary, bonuses, awards, and profits from buying or selling securities.\n\nThe bill also expands the authority of the FDIC to claw back compensation of parties responsible for financial losses incurred by a financial company regardless of the process by which FDIC is appointed receiver.\u00a0\n\nFinally, the bill establishes that the creditors and shareholders of an insured depository institution's holding company are responsible for the losses when the institution is resolved by the FDIC."
