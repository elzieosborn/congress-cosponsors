    "text": "Parental Rights Protection Act\n\nThis bill restricts government entities from requiring that individuals age 18 or younger receive certain COVID-19 vaccines that were authorized through emergency use and related procedures.\n\nSpecifically, a federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local government entity (including a local educational agency) that receives funding from either the Department of Education or the Department of Health and Human Services may not require such COVID-19 vaccinations for individuals age 18 or younger. In particular, a local educational agency that mandates COVID-19 vaccinations for students loses its eligibility for federal education funding.\n\nThe bill also requires the prior, informed, written consent of a parent or guardian before administration of such COVID-19 vaccines to an individual age 18 or younger."
