This bill permits tribal child support enforcement agencies to access the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program to collect past-due child support payments from the federal tax refunds of noncustodial parents.

Additionally, the bill authorizes the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration to disclose certain tax return information to tribal child support enforcement agencies. Such information may be disclosed to establish and collect child support obligations from, and to locate, those individuals owing such obligations.

It also permits the Department of Health and Human Services to reimburse tribal agencies for certain reporting costs related to the Federal Parent Locator Service.</summary>
