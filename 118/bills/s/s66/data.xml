  <summary date="2023-06-02T16:31:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">NOTAM Improvement Act of 2023

This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish the FAA Task Force on NOTAM (notice to air missions required by international or domestic law) Improvement. A NOTAM is a notice containing information essential to personnel concerned with flight operations but not known far enough in advance to be publicized by other means. It states the abnormal status of a component of the National Airspace System.

Specifically, the task force must (1) review existing methods for presenting NOTAMs and flight operations information for pilots; (2) review regulations and policies relating to NOTAMs, including their content and presentation to pilots; (3) evaluate and determine best practices to organize, prioritize, and present flight operations information in a manner that optimizes pilot review and retention of relevant information; (4) provide recommendations to improve the presentation of NOTAM information; and (5) report to Congress on its reviews and evaluations.</summary>
