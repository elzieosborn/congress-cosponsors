    "text": "United States-Uruguay Economic Partnership Act\n\nThis bill addresses issues related to Uruguay.\n\nSpecifically, this bill adds Uruguay to the list of countries eligible for designation as a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. (Such a designation generally provides for duty-free entry of goods into the United States from the designated countries, with some exclusions and limitations.)\n\nThe bill also establishes that a national of Uruguay shall be eligible for an E visa (for an investor or trader who is a national of a foreign country with a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States) if Uruguay provides a similar nonimmigrant status to U.S. nationals.\n\nFurthermore, the Department of Homeland Security must report to Congress an assessment as to whether Uruguay meets the eligibility criteria for the Visa Waiver Program. If Uruguay fails to meet the criteria, the report must also describe what actions Uruguay must take to become eligible. (Citizens of countries in the program may travel to the United States for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa.)"
