The bill also makes changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, earned income tax credit (EITC), heads of household filing status, tax exemption for dependents, and deduction for dependent care expenses.

This bill increases the child tax credit for 2026 to $3,000 or $4,200 for each child, depending on the child&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s age, makes the tax credit fully refundable (currently a portion is refundable), and allows taxpayers to receive the tax credit in advance monthly payments. Under the bill, the child tax credit is limited to six children and phases out once a taxpayer&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s income exceeds a certain threshold.

The bill provides a new refundable tax credit for pregnant mothers of $2,800, which phases out once a taxpayer&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s income exceeds a certain threshold. Taxpayers may receive the tax credit in advance monthly payments.
