    "text": "Family Security Act\n\nThis bill increases the child tax credit and provides a new tax credit for pregnant mothers. The bill also makes changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, earned income tax credit (EITC), heads of household filing status, tax exemption for dependents, and deduction for dependent care expenses.\n\nThis bill increases the child tax credit for 2026 to $3,000 or $4,200 for each child, depending on the child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age, makes the tax credit fully refundable (currently a portion is refundable), and allows taxpayers to receive the tax credit in advance monthly payments. Under the bill, the child tax credit is limited to six children and phases out once a taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nThe bill provides a new refundable tax credit for pregnant mothers of $2,800, which phases out once a taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income exceeds a certain threshold. Taxpayers may receive the tax credit in advance monthly payments.\n\nThe bill permanently extends the SALT deduction for individuals (currently, the SALT deduction for individuals expires in 2026) and increases the limit to $30,000 from $10,000 (or to $15,000 from $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately). \u00a0\n\nThe bill permanently eliminates the tax exemption for dependents. Under current law, a tax exemption for dependents is available starting in 2026.\n\nThis bill also eliminates the\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00a0 \u00a0head of household filing status,\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00a0 \u00a0tax credit for dependent care expenses for children under 13 years old, and\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00a0 \u00a0different percentages that apply based on the number of qualifying children in the EITC calculation."
