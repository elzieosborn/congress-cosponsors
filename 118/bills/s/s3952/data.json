In addition, the bill defines early high school graduation fast track pathways as scholarships for students who graduate high school early, do not require remedial coursework in postsecondary education, and attend a public two- or four-year institution of higher education.The bill also makes certain high school students participating in an early college fast track pathway eligible to receive Pell Grants."
