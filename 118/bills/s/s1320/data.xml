This bill requires the President and the Department of State to provide Congress with certain information related to the conflict in Ukraine. The bill requires the President to determine, within 60 days of receiving a request from Congress, whether a person (individual or entity) described in the request meets the criteria to be subject to a sanctions law that targets those who commit serious human rights abuses in territory forcibly occupied by Russia. The President must submit a report to Congress stating whether the President imposed or intends to impose sanctions on any person described in such a request. The bill also requires the State Department to include additional information in certain human rights reports to Congress. The additional information concerns human rights abuses committed by Russian forces in Ukraine or against individuals in Ukraine who are forcibly relocated.</summary>
