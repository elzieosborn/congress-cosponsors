This bill expands the disclosure requirements for certain tax-exempt organizations.

This bill requires the annual tax return information for tax-exempt organizations and deferred compensation plans to be made available to the public at no charge and in an open structured data format that is processable by computers, with the information easy to find, access, reuse, and download in bulk.

The bill also requires the disclosure of the names and addresses of contributors of $5,000 or more&#160;to tax-exempt organizations that participate or intervene in political campaigns on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office.</summary>
