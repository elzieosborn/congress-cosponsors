This bill increases penalties for, and establishes additional enforcement mechanisms related to, fraudulent and grossly negligent violations of U.S. customs laws.

Specifically, the bill increases the maximum civil penalty for a fraudulent violation to three times the domestic value of the merchandise. Further, the bill prohibits a person who commits a fraudulent violation from importing merchandise into the United States for a five-year period.

Additionally, the bill increases the maximum civil penalty for a grossly negligent violation to the lesser of (1) 3 times the domestic value of the merchandise; or (2) 10 times the lawful duties, taxes, and fees. It also prohibits a person who commits a grossly negligent violation from importing merchandise into the United States for a two-year period.

Further, the bill applies these importation bans to an affiliated person (e.g., a family member, partner, or employee) of the person who committed the fraudulent or grossly negligent violation.

The bill also establishes a private right of action for customs fraud or grossly negligent violations. In particular, the bill allows manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, labor unions, or trade associations to bring a civil action against a violator or any person that aids or abets a violator.

The bill prohibits any person (or an affiliated person) who commits a fraudulent or grossly negligent violation from participating in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Importer of Record program, and further requires their importer of record numbers to be revoked.</summary>
