The Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander category must include Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Chamorro, Tongan, iTaukei, and Marshallese, and, to the greatest extent practicable, additional subgroups such as the Chuukese and Palauan.\n\nThe Department of Education must develop guidance related to whether and when these reporting requirements will yield statistically reliable information. Such guidance shall help to inform the minimum number of students that will maximize data reporting for each major racial and ethnic group."
