The bill also requires the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on certain individuals identified in the report if appropriate under U.S. law.\n\nAmong other things, the report must (1) identify prominent criminal gangs in Haiti, (2) list Haitian political and economic elites that have links to criminal gangs, (3) assess how collusion between Haitian political and economic elites and criminal gangs threatens the Haitian people and U.S. national interests, and (4) assess what actions the governments of the United States and Haiti could take to address those threats.\n\nThe President may waive sanctions in certain circumstances."
