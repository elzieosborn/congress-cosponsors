Further, the bill prohibits federal funds from being obligated or expended for the procurement of these products from Russia.\n\nThese prohibitions shall terminate on the date on which the President determines and certifies to Congress that (1) the Russian government has terminated its prohibition on the importation of these products from the United States, (2) the Russian government and its proxies have withdrawn all military and paramilitary forces from Ukraine, and (3) the President has received credible commitments from the Russian government that it will not engage in hostile action against Ukraine in the future."
