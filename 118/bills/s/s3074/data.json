Such schools must also implement policies that specify permitted device usage and screen time by grade. Schools must submit copies of their internet safety and screen time policies to the Federal Communications Commission, and the commission must make those policies publicly available in a database. \u00a0\n\nUnder the bill, social media platforms are defined as online platforms that primarily provide a forum for users to generate and share content.\u00a0"
