This bill requires schools receiving specified federal funding for internet connectivity to limit students&#226;&#8364;&#8482; screen time and access to social media platforms on subsidized devices and networks.&#160;

Specifically, schools receiving funding through the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support (E-Rate) program or the Emergency Connectivity Fund may not allow students to access social media platforms&#160;on subsidized devices or networks. Such schools must also implement policies that specify permitted device usage and screen time by grade. Schools must submit copies of their internet safety and screen time policies to the Federal Communications Commission, and the commission must make those policies publicly available in a database. &#160;

Under the bill, social media platforms are defined as online platforms that primarily provide a forum for users to generate and share content.&#160;</summary>
