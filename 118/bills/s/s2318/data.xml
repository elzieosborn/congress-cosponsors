This bill requires the Department of Defense to submit a strategy to Congress for deploying ground-based theater-range missiles in the Indo-Pacific region. Among other elements, the strategy must include an assessment of the gaps in conventional theater-range precision strike capabilities in the area of responsibility of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.
