  <summary date="2024-03-01T19:42:11Z" status="Reported to Senate">This bill revises the land claims of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. In particular, the bill specifies that only the tribe's claims to the 84 acres of land known as the Thompson Strip, rather than the tribe's claims to any lands within Oregon, are extinguished.

Additionally, the bill prohibits gaming on any real property obtained by the tribe as part of a land claim settlement approved by the United States, including any real property purchased with funds granted as part of any land claim settlement.</summary>
