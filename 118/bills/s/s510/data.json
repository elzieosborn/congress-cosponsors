DOD must make the program available to such members of the air force of Israel and ensure that they may participate immediately after completing training.\n\nDOD must rotationally deploy one or more KC-46 aircraft to Israel until the earlier of five years after the enactment of this bill or the date on which a KC-46 aircraft procured by the military forces of Israel is commissioned into such military forces and achieves full combat capability."
