Those agencies may not obligate or expend loan or grant funds for such purposes.\n\nA biotechnology company of concern includes BGI, MGI, Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and any subsidiary, parent affiliate, or successor of such entities, and any entity that\n\n is subject to the jurisdiction, direction, control, or operates on behalf of the government of a foreign adversary; is involved in the manufacturing, distribution, provision, or procurement of a biotechnology equipment or service; and poses a risk to U.S. national security based on specified activities. Executive agencies may waive the prohibitions on a case-by-case basis under specified circumstances.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget must develop and periodically update a list of the entities that constitute biotechnology companies of concern."
