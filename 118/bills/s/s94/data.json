    "text": "Investing in State Energy Act of 2023\n\nThis bill revises requirements concerning the distribution of funds under the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and the State Energy Program (SEP) to state agencies and local partners that implement energy initiatives. Under WAP, the Department of Energy (DOE) reduces energy costs for low-income households by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes. Under SEP, DOE supports state energy conservation plans and energy security.\n\nThis bill requires DOE, upon receiving state or area plans under WAP or SEP, to distribute funds to the recipients of the funding as quickly as practicable.\n\nWithin 60 days of Congress making the funds available for WAP and SEP, DOE must (1) provide application guidance for financial assistance, and (2) publish the allocation of financial assistance to be provided to states under the programs."
