Specifically, it redefines foreign official so that it does not include an individual acting in an unofficial capacity on behalf of a foreign government or international organization.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, this act broadens the scope of conduct that is prohibited. As originally enacted, FEPA generally prohibited conduct to solicit or accept a bribe in return for influence in the performance of any official act. This act broadens the scope of the prohibited conduct to include the solicitation or acceptance of a bribe in return for influence in the performance of any act or decision.\u00a0\n\nFinally, this act specifies that extraterritorial jurisdiction applies if the foreign official soliciting or accepting the bribe is in the United States. \u00a0"
