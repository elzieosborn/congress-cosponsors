This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support efforts to map the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain and identify associated vulnerabilities.

As part of these efforts, HHS must support the development of a database of certain essential medicines and the identification of information about their supply chain, including the location&#160;of manufacturing facilities. Qualifying essential medicines are those that are likely to be needed in the event of a public health emergency or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threat or for which a shortage would pose a significant threat to the U.S. health care system or at-risk populations.&#160;</summary>
