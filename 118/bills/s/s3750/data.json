    "text": "Redistricting Reform Act of 2024\n\nThis bill outlines criteria for congressional redistricting and generally prohibits mid-decade redistricting.\n\nSpecifically, the\u00a0bill requires congressional districts to comply with the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Further, congressional districts must be drawn to (1) ensure the practical ability of a protected group to participate in the political process, nominate candidates, and elect representatives of choice; and (2) represent communities of interest and neighborhoods.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits the use of a redistricting plan that was drawn with the intent (or has the effect of) materially favoring or disfavoring any political party.\n\nThe entity responsible for developing and adopting the congressional redistricting plan of a state must solicit and take into consideration comments from the public throughout the process of developing the plan.\n\nThe bill creates judicial remedies if a state fails to enact a final congressional redistricting plan. In particular, if a state fails to enact such a final plan by the applicable deadline, then a\u00a0three-judge district court shall have the exclusive\u00a0authority to develop and publish the congressional redistricting plan for the state.\n\nThe bill also includes a provision to prevent states from redistricting more than once following an apportionment (i.e., mid-decade redistricting).\u00a0"
