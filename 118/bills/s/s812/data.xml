This bill temporarily expands the awards program for cost-saving identifications&#160;by federal employees of fraud, waste, or mismanagement to include identifications of surplus salaries and expenses funds.

Savings resulting from such&#160;identifications shall generally be used for deficit reduction,&#160;but agencies may&#160;retain up to 10% of such savings for the purpose of paying cash awards to employees for making the identifications. An officer may not receive such award if the officer (1) serves in a position at level one of the Executive Schedule; (2) is the head of an agency; or (3) is a commissioner, board member, or other voting member of an independent establishment.</summary>
