This bill establishes the International Children with Disabilities Protection Program in the Department of State.

Through the program, the State Department may provide grants to assist organizations of persons with disabilities and family members of children with disabilities in communicating about and advocating for policies that ensure the family inclusion and transition to independent living of children with disabilities.

The bill also authorizes the State Department to fund certain nongovernmental organizations to build the capacity to advance policies such as (1) creating rights protection programs for people with disabilities, and (2) promoting the development of advocacy skills and leadership abilities of people with disabilities.</summary>
