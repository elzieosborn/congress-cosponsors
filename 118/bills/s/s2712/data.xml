  <summary date="2024-02-07T19:30:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill funds grants and other activities to support next generation 9-1-1 systems (i.e., interoperable, secure, Internet Protocol-based systems for receiving 9-1-1 requests for emergency assistance).

Specifically, the bill provides funding that is available through FY2030 to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for grants to state, tribal, and territorial organizations (or entities established by one or more of those organizations) to implement next generation 9-1-1 systems. The Inspector General of the Department of Commerce must conduct oversight related to the grants.

The bill also provides funding that is available through FY2032 for establishing (1) a center to coordinate with state, local, and regional governments about cybersecurity threats to next generation 9-1-1 systems and strategies to detect and prevent such threats; and (2) an advisory board to provide the NTIA with recommendations about next generation 9-1-1 activities.</summary>
