The program may guarantee loans to support new investments in the start-up or expansion of projects in the United States that will increase U.S. food supply chain capacity to aggregate, process, manufacture, store, transport, wholesale, or distribute food.\n\nIn awarding loan guarantees under this bill, USDA must give preference to loans for projects that create jobs in economically distressed communities or to help create a more resilient, diverse, and secure U.S. food supply chain.\n\nUSDA must prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this program.\n\nThe bill specifies that USDA must use the amounts made available to carry out this bill to supplement, and not supplant, funds provided under other federal, state, or local law."
