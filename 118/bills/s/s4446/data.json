    "text": "National Construction Safety Team Enhancement Act of 2024\n\nThis bill expands the authority of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to investigate structural failures other than those involving buildings and to recommend related improvements to engineering standards and practices.\n\nSpecifically, the bill expands the investigative authority of NIST's National Construction Safety Teams. Currently, these teams are authorized to investigate the structural failure of a building that has resulted in substantial loss of life or that had the significant potential to cause a substantial loss of life. These teams must (1) identify the likely cause of the failure, (2) evaluate the technical aspects of evacuation and response procedures, and (3) recommend ways to improve building standards, codes, and practices and other related actions based on their findings.\n\nThe bill expands this authority beyond buildings to include other types of structures and related engineering standards and practices.\u00a0"
