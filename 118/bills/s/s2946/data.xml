This bill authorizes grants for expanding access to drugs or devices to treat opioid overdoses (e.g., naloxone) in elementary and secondary schools.

The Department of Health and Human Services may award the grants to states, Indian tribes, and localities. To receive a grant, recipients must certify that schools in their jurisdictions will stock the drugs and devices and have trained staff on premises during operating hours to administer them.

Additionally, the attorney general of the recipient's state must certify that trained staff are covered by state civil liability protections for individuals who administer aid in an emergency (commonly known as Good Samaritan laws).</summary>
