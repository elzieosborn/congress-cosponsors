This bill requires the Department of State to designate four specified Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. (Among other things, such a designation allows the Department of the Treasury to require financial institutions to block transactions involving the organization.)

The bill also requires the State Department to designate other Mexican drug cartels, or factions of such cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations if they meet certain criteria.</summary>
