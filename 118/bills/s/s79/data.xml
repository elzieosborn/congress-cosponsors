This bill establishes the Interagency Task Force on Patents to support coordination and communication between the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on activities relating to patents for human drugs and biological products.

The task force's duties shall include sharing information about (1) the processes of each agency, including how each agency evaluates applications (e.g., patent applications at the PTO and new drug applications at the FDA); and (2) new approvals of patents, human drugs, biological products, and new technologies. The task force must also establish a process that requires (1) the PTO to request from the FDA information relating to certain patent applications to help patent examiners carry out their duties, (2) the FDA to provide such information to the PTO, and (3) the PTO to assist the FDA in its ministerial role of listing patents.</summary>
