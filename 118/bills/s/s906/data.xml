This bill withdraws normal trade relations treatment (i.e., nondiscriminatory treatment) from China.

Further, the bill (1) sets the applicable duty rates on U.S. imports from China as the rates listed in column 2 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, and (2) authorizes the President to further increase the applicable duty rates.

These provisions become effective two years after the bill's enactment.</summary>
