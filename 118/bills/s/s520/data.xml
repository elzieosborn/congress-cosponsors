This bill requires the Department of State and the Federal of Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to provide notifications and public information about certain Chinese police-related activities outside of China.

The State Department must publish (and keep updated) on its travel alert systems a list of all countries that have a bilateral security agreement or joint police initiative with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The FBI must annually brief Congress on the Chinese government's presence internationally through bilateral security agreements and joint police initiatives.

Furthermore, if the FBI discovers in the United States a police station operated by China's government or the CCP, the FBI must (1) notify the applicable state and local law enforcement agencies within 24 hours of the discovery, (2) notify the public through law enforcement bulletin within 72 hours of the discovery, (3) provide a briefing to Congress within 15 days of the discovery, and (4) provide periodic updates to Congress after the initial briefing.</summary>
