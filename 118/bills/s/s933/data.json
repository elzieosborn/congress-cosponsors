The GSA must issue guidance to ensure that covered agencies incorporate the minimum requirements into current data centers.\n\nDuring the development and planning of a new data center, an agency must report to the GSA and Congress upon determining it is likely to make a management or financial decision relating to such data center.\n\nIn determining whether to establish a new data center or continue to operate an existing data center, an agency must (1) ensure that each at-risk legacy application is updated, replaced, or modernized; and (2) prioritize and leverage commercial cloud environments.\n\nThe GSA must maintain a public-facing website that includes information related to agency compliance with data center requirements.\n\nAn agency must oversee and manage the data center portfolio and the information technology strategy of the agency in accordance with federal cybersecurity guidelines and directives.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must review, verify, and audit compliance with the minimum requirements for new and existing data centers."
