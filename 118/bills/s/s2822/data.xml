This bill provides statutory authority for and expands the Department of Education&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s (ED&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s) Green Ribbon Schools program. (This program was established in 2011 to recognize early learning centers, schools, districts, and postsecondary institutions for excellence in reducing environmental impact, increasing health and wellness, and providing sustainability education.)

In conducting the Green Ribbon Schools program, ED must (1) reserve funding for the Department of the Interior to carry out activities with respect to schools operated or funded by the Bureau of Indian Education; (2) award grants to state educational agencies for the purpose of supporting and engaging eligible entities as green schools; and (3) provide an honorarium to each award winner, subject to appropriations.

The bill directs the Institute of Museum and Library Services to establish an award program for nonformal learning institutions (e.g., libraries, museums, and zoos) that is modeled on ED&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s program.

The bill also establishes within ED the Office of School Infrastructure and Sustainability.</summary>
