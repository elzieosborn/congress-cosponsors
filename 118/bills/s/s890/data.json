    "text": "Screening Partnership Reform Act\n\nThis bill revises the Screening Partnership Program of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Under the program, the TSA contracts with qualified private companies for security screening services at commercial airports.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the TSA to provide the operator of an airport with the opportunity to (1) select a preferred qualified private screening company for the screening services contract, or (2) request that the TSA select the screening company for the contract.\n\nA private screening company may use screening supervisors who have been trained and certified at a Federal Law Enforcement Training Center to administer comparable on-site training and certification to private security screeners at an airport that is participating in the Screening Partnership Program.\n\nThe bill also removes a requirement that a qualified private screening company provide employees compensation and other benefits that are not less than the level provided to federal government personnel."
