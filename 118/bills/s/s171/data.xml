This bill prohibits consideration of certain factors in decisions about access to federally provided treatments or vaccines for COVID-19.

As a condition of receiving the treatments or vaccines from the federal government, states, localities, and private entities must ensure that specified demographic characteristics (e.g., race, sex, and age) or other characteristics (e.g., vaccination status, veteran status, and political ideology or speech) are not taken into account when determining a patient's eligibility for treatments or vaccines.</summary>
