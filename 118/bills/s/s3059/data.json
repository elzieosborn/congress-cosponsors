The bill additionally specifies that if a provider is listed as in-network in this directory when a beneficiary selects and makes an appointment with the provider, but the provider is not actually in-network, the beneficiary is still only responsible for paying in-network cost-sharing requirements.\n\nMA organizations must annually evaluate and report on the accuracy of their directories; the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and MA organizations must publish this information on their websites. The bill provides funds for these purposes.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the bill's implementation."
