(This includes the dimensions of seat shoulder width, elbow width, the edge of the seat base to the back of the seat in front, the edge of the seat base to the headrest of the seat in front, and foot clearance.) This moratorium remains in place until the effective date of FAA regulations establishing minimum seat dimensions."
