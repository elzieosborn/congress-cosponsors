This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish minimum dimensions for seats on passenger aircraft (including dimensions for the size, width, length, and pitch of seats) to ensure the safety and health of passengers.

Further, the bill prohibits air carriers and foreign air carriers from reducing the seat size, width, length, or pitch for passenger aircraft. (This includes the dimensions of seat shoulder width, elbow width, the edge of the seat base to the back of the seat in front, the edge of the seat base to the headrest of the seat in front, and foot clearance.) This moratorium remains in place until the effective date of FAA regulations establishing minimum seat dimensions.</summary>
