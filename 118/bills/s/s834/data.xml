This bill reauthorizes the Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority (AGARDA) and expands the program's environmental sustainability goals. (The program supports innovative research and development of technology, research tools, and products to address long-term and high-risk challenges related to food and agriculture.)

 The bill expands the program's goals to include water conservation and responding to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as resilience to (1) drought, (2) infectious diseases, and (3) plant and animal pathogens and pests.

The bill also removes the current pilot program designation and requires the Department of Agriculture to establish and maintain an AGARDA staff.</summary>
