    "text": "Reliable Rail Service Act\n\nThis bill revises freight rail transportation policy to require rail carriers to provide transportation or service in a manner that meets the shipper's need for timely, efficient, and reliable rail service and fulfills the shipper's reasonable service requirements. (Current policy requires rail carriers to provide the transportation or service on reasonable request.)\n\nIt also establishes specific criteria for the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to consider when determining whether a rail carrier has violated its obligations under the policy. The STB must expedite any proceedings to consider a rail carrier's alleged violation of the policy.\n\nThe bill also specifies that information a rail carrier must provide on the carrier's rates and other service terms includes information on reasonable transit or cycle times consistent with the requestor's needs and requirements for the efficient and reliable receipt, transportation, and delivery of property."
