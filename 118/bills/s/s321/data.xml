This bill extends federal firearms-related restrictions to individuals who are convicted of a misdemeanor crime of stalking.

The term&#160;misdemeanor crime of stalking&#160;means an offense that is a misdemeanor under federal, state, tribal, or local law and has a course of harassment, intimidation, or surveillance that (1) causes emotional distress, or (2) places a person in reasonable fear of harm to themselves, an immediate family member, an individual who shares or has shared a residence, an intimate partner, or a pet. The term intimate partner includes an individual who is or was in a dating relationship with the person or any other individual similarly situated to a spouse.

Additionally, the bill extends federal firearms-related restrictions to individuals who are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening an individual who is in a current or former dating relationship with them or who is similarly situated to a spouse. Currently, federal firearms-related restrictions generally only apply to individuals who are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening a co-parent of a child, a current or former spouse, or a current or former cohabitant.</summary>
