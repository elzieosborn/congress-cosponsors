The term intimate partner includes an individual who is or was in a dating relationship with the person or any other individual similarly situated to a spouse.\n\nAdditionally, the bill extends federal firearms-related restrictions to individuals who are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening an individual who is in a current or former dating relationship with them or who is similarly situated to a spouse. Currently, federal firearms-related restrictions generally only apply to individuals who are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening a co-parent of a child, a current or former spouse, or a current or former cohabitant."
