 This bill provides FY2024 appropriations for the legislative branch, including the Senate and joint items such as

 the Joint Economic Committee, Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies of 2025, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Office of the Attending Physician, and the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services. In addition, the bill provides FY2024 appropriations for

 the Capitol Police; the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights; the Congressional Budget Office; the Architect of the Capitol; the Library of Congress, including the Congressional Research Service and the Copyright Office; the Government Publishing Office; the Government Accountability Office; Congressional Office for International Leadership Fund; and the John C.
