This bill requires certain internet platforms (e.g., large websites and social networks) that use algorithms for suggesting content to obtain express consent from their users before collecting or sharing their personal data. These platforms must notify users of this requirement. The notice must include specified information, including the type of data collected and the names of any third parties with which the data is shared.

The bill provides for enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and a private right of action against a violator of the bill.</summary>
