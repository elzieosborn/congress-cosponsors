(Under the program, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service works in coordination with the Texas Animal Health Commission to combat the spread of cattle fever ticks, which can spread a serious cattle disease called bovine babesiosis or cattle fever.)\n\nSpecifically, USDA must enter into a contract to review and report on the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program with a (1) land-grant college or university, or (2) non-land-grant college of agriculture.\n\nThe review must include an evaluation of\n\n the program's effectiveness with respect to preventing and reducing the spread of cattle fever ticks; the program's benefits, and the burdens of compliance, to cattle producers; the treatment protocols developed and implemented under the program; and the federal and state funds allocated to support the program for the most recent fiscal year."
