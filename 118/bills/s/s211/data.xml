  <summary date="2023-10-19T16:39:20Z" status="Reported to Senate">Saving Money and Accelerating Repairs Through Leasing Act or the SMART Leasing Act 

This bill authorizes the General Services Administration (GSA) to establish a pilot program that allows federal agencies to lease underutilized properties with GSA approval and to use the rent payments to reduce the deficit and help fund capital projects and facilities maintenance.

The GSA may not enter into a lease unless it certifies that the lease will not have a negative impact on its mission or that of the applicable federal agency.

The bill provides for a maximum of six leases under the program during each fiscal year, with a term of up to 15 years.

Of collected funds that are not used to cover costs in connection with the lease, 50% shall be deposited in a working capital account and remain available until expended for maintenance, capital revitalization, and improvements, and 50% deposited in the Treasury's general fund for deficit reduction.

The GSA may not enter into a lease under the pilot program with any individual or entity that

 intends to carry out, under the lease, activities that are illegal to conduct in federal facilities or under federal law or activities for which federal funding is prohibited; is a political organization; is owned, operated, or controlled by a foreign government; or received any federal grant, contract, or award from the applicable federal agency engaged in the lease that is still in the performance period. No lease entered into under the pilot program may be used to carry out lobbying activities.</summary>
