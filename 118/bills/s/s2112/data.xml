  <summary date="2024-07-23T19:54:42Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Search Engines Examine Care Compare Act or the SEE Care Compare Act

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to take certain actions to optimize the ability of beneficiaries to find the Medicare Care Compare website. (The website allows Medicare beneficiaries to find and compare health care providers, such as physicians, hospitals, and nursing homes.)

The CMS must use search engine optimization practices to&#160;make it easier for beneficiaries to find the website, including best practices for indexing and searching, recommendations from search engines, and research-based website designs. The CMS must report on website analytics (e.g., internet traffic) and recommend appropriate legislative and administrative action.</summary>
