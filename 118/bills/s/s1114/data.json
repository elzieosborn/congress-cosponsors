    "text": "Expanding Access to Low-Cost Generics Act of 2023\n\nThis bill modifies provisions related to market exclusivity for a generic drug.\n\nCurrently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) awards 180 days of exclusivity on the market to a first applicant to file a qualifying application for market approval of a generic drug. Generally, this exclusivity period begins upon a first applicant's commercial marketing of the drug.\n\nThe bill authorizes the FDA to approve a subsequent generic drug application prior to a first applicant's first date of commercial marketing if (1) the subsequent application is ready for full approval, (2) the applicant certifies that there are no conditions that would prevent commercial marketing of the drug within 75 days of approval and that the applicant intends to do so, (3) a first applicant's application has been pending for at least 33 months, (4) the approval of a first applicant's application is not precluded by patent infringement claims asserted against that first applicant, and (5) no first applicant's application has been effectively approved on the date that all such conditions are met.\n\nIf an applicant fails to begin commercially marketing their drug within 75 days of approval via the aforementioned process, the applicant's approval is deemed tentative and the applicant is no longer eligible for subsequent approvals, unless the applicant certifies that the failure was due to unforeseen issues that have since been resolved.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA must inform generic drug applicants, upon request or during review, whether the drug is qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the listed brand-name drug (and if not, the reasons why)."
