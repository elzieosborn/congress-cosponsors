This bill requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to periodically determine the&#160;jobs that&#160;exist in significant numbers in the national economy, for purposes of&#160;Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) eligibility, in a manner that accounts for the full range of work in the national economy, including in emerging industries. The SSA must report to Congress about the results of each determination.

Under current law, in order to qualify for SSDI,&#160;applicants must generally&#160;be unable to perform any kind of substantial work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. SSA has historically relied on the Department of Labor's Dictionary of Occupational Titles to make these job determinations, which has not been updated since 1991.</summary>
