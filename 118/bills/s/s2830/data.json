    "text": "Improving Employment Options for DI Beneficiaries Act\n\nThis bill requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to periodically determine the\u00a0jobs that\u00a0exist in significant numbers in the national economy, for purposes of\u00a0Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) eligibility, in a manner that accounts for the full range of work in the national economy, including in emerging industries. The SSA must report to Congress about the results of each determination.\n\nUnder current law, in order to qualify for SSDI,\u00a0applicants must generally\u00a0be unable to perform any kind of substantial work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy. SSA has historically relied on the Department of Labor's Dictionary of Occupational Titles to make these job determinations, which has not been updated since 1991."
