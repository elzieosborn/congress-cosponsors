This act makes changes to provisions relating to the Inspector General (IG) of the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Specifically, if the IG is removed from office or transferred to another position or location within GAO, GAO must communicate in writing the substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons, for any such removal or transfer to both chambers of Congress not later than 30 days before the removal or transfer.

Only the Comptroller General may place the IG on non-duty status, subject to specified requirements.

GAO must include the annual budget request of the IG in the GAO budget without change.

The IG shall obtain legal advice from a counsel reporting directly to the IG or another IG.</summary>
