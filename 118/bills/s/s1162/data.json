    "text": "Accurate Map for Broadband Investment Act of 2023\n\nThis bill modifies the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program by requiring a portion of program funds to be reallocated using an updated version of the National Broadband Map. (The map identifies areas that lack access to broadband internet; the Federal Communications Commission is responsible for creating and periodically updating the map.)\n\nThe BEAD Program is managed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and provides funds to states and territories for broadband deployment, connectivity, mapping, and adoption projects. Current law allocates the majority of BEAD funds based on the share of locations in a given state or territory that the National Broadband Map designates as unserved by broadband internet. Current law also provides for the release of BEAD funds in stages; generally, a state or territory receives 20% of its funds after the NTIA approves its initial proposal for using the funds and the remaining funds after the NTIA approves its final proposal.\n\nUnder this bill, after distributing BEAD funds for initial proposals, the NTIA must reallocate the remaining funds using the most current version of the National Broadband Map and distribute those funds based on the reallocation."
