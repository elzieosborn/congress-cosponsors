This bill directs the Department of Commerce to designate at least seven entities as Ocean Innovation Clusters. Ocean Innovation Clusters are hubs for private, public, and academic stakeholders to collaborate on opportunities to promote and enhance the maritime industry and the Blue Economy.

In designating entities, Commerce shall prioritize entities with a history of supporting cross-sector growth and development of the Blue Economy.&#160;(Under the bill, the term Blue Economy generally refers to the value and impact of sustainable industries related to the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts on the economy of the United States.)

Additionally, Commerce must designate at least one Ocean Innovation Cluster in (1) each of the regions covered by the five regional offices of the National Marine Fisheries Service, (2) the Great Lakes region, and (3) the Gulf of Mexico region.

Commerce may award competitive grants for the establishment, operation, and administration of Ocean Innovation Clusters.</summary>
