An individual must file a written petition for such review not later than 30 days after the complaint is issued or authorized.\n\nThe bill further permits either party to a complaint proceeding to appeal to a federal court of appeals if the NLRB does not issue a final order within one year after a report is issued by an administrative law judge or decision is issued by a regional director."
