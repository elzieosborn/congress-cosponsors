An individual's refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, or an entity's refusal to institute COVID-19 vaccine requirements, on the basis of a sincerely held religious belief is considered to be religious exercise.\n\nThe bill establishes a private right of action and authorizes the federal government to bring civil actions for violations.\n\nThe bill applies to any mandates adopted before, on, or after the bill's date of enactment."
