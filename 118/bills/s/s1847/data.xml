This bill requires public use airports that have received certain federal grants or property conveyances to provide transient general aviation aircraft parking on or near the existing apron in specific circumstances. A transient general aviation aircraft is an aircraft that is not owned or operated by an air carrier and is seeking to park temporarily at an airport.

Specifically, transient general aviation aircraft parking must be provided on or near the existing apron when a pilot or owner of the aircraft does not need or request fuel or use other related services from the airport or a fixed-base operator at the airport. A fixed-base operator is a business that is operating on an airport or heliport and provides aeronautical services, such as fueling, rentals, and parking.

A public use airport may assess a fee on a transient general aviation aircraft for using the transient apron; the fee must be fair, reasonable, transparent, and publicly available. It must also exclude any extraneous or hidden costs. A controlled access airport or a fixed-base operator at the airport may not charge a fee for a pilot or passenger to transit between their transient general aviation aircraft parked on the transient apron and a place outside the airport's perimeter fence, whether or not the individual must pass through a building.</summary>
