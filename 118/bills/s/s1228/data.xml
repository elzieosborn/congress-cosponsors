This bill authorizes the United States Mint to modify the metallic composition of circulating coins (including by prescribing reasonable manufacturing tolerances with respect to those coins) if a study and analysis conducted by the Mint indicates that the modification will

 reduce costs incurred by the taxpayers; be seamless, which means that the coins must have the same weight and diameter as current coins and that the coins work interchangeably in most coin acceptors using electromagnetic signature technology; and have as minimal an adverse impact as possible on the public and stakeholders. The Mint must notify Congress before making the modification and provide a justification for the modification. Congress may disapprove of any proposed modification through a joint resolution.</summary>
