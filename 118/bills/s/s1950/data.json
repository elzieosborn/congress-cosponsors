The DEA must schedule, reschedule, or remove from scheduling any new fentanyl-related substances that it identifies after the bill's enactment within three years of identification. The DEA may temporarily schedule newly identified fentanyl-related substances under schedule I for up to three years.\u00a0 The bill provides for the rescheduling of fentanyl-related substances to lower schedules, or for their removal from scheduling altogether, based on appropriate scientific and medical evaluations from the Department of Health and Human Services.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also provides for expedited registrations to research schedule I controlled substances, including by allowing for the continuation and consolidation of research under a single registration.\u00a0"
