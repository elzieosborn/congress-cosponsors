This bill requires a cable operator or satellite carrier to provide their subscribers in specified Wisconsin counties (i.e., Ashland, Barron, Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, Dunn, Florence, Iron, Pierce, Polk, Sawyer, St. Croix, or Washburn) the choice of retransmission of (1) the signal of any local network station that the operator or carrier is required to retransmit to the subscriber; (2) an in-state, adjacent-market network station; or (3) both. This will allow residents of such Wisconsin counties currently assigned to an out-of-state Minnesota television market to access programming in Wisconsin.</summary>
