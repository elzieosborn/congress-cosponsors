This bill establishes within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a National Center on Antiracism and Health and a law enforcement violence prevention program.

In particular, the new center must carry out various activities to address racism and its impact on health and well-being. This includes declaring racism a public health crisis, collecting and analyzing data, and administering research and grant programs.

Additionally, the bill specifically directs the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, in coordination with the Department of Justice and other relevant stakeholders, to implement the law enforcement violence prevention program by conducting research and supporting other activities pertaining to law enforcement violence and public health.</summary>
