This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to make available online certain information about solicitations for infant formula bids under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Under current law, state agencies must control infant formula costs in the WIC program through competitive bidding for infant formula rebate contracts. The bill requires state WIC agencies to provide USDA with a description of open solicitations for these competitive bids that includes the title of the solicitation, the state agency administering the solicitation, and other relevant information for the USDA to publish online.</summary>
