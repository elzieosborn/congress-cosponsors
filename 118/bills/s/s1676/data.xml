 This bill amends the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program (RTCP) to provide specified funds for the RTCP through FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter. The RTCP provides reimbursement payments for geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers (e.g., those in Hawaii and Alaska) for a portion of the cost to transport agricultural commodities or inputs used to produce an agricultural commodity.

The bill also removes a $15 million payment cap for any given fiscal year. Further, USDA may not impose a limitation on the amount of producer payments for any fiscal year that the program funds are equal to or exceed demand.</summary>
