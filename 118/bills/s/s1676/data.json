The RTCP provides reimbursement payments for geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers (e.g., those in Hawaii and Alaska) for a portion of the cost to transport agricultural commodities or inputs used to produce an agricultural commodity.\n\nThe bill also removes a $15 million payment cap for any given fiscal year. Further, USDA may not impose a limitation on the amount of producer payments for any fiscal year that the program funds are equal to or exceed demand."
