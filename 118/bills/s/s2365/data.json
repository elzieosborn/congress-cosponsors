    "text": "SNAP Next Step Act of 2023\n\nThis bill allows a state agency to use Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) administrative funding for certain\u00a0Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs.\n\nSpecifically, a state agency may recruit eligible SNAP participants for, and carry out employment and training activities under, WIOA programs. Participants must (1) be in a household that is receiving SNAP assistance, (2) meet SNAP participation requirements (e.g., work requirements)\u00a0or be exempt from those requirements, (3) be unemployed or underemployed, (4) be in a family that is not receiving assistance under a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, and (5) not be enrolled in a\u00a0state program that is identified as an Employment First program by a state workforce agency.\u00a0\n\nFurther, a state agency may develop a publicly available employment calculator for the state agency's website to assist SNAP recipients in calculating whether the amount of benefits received would be greater or lesser than income from future employment. Developing the calculator must be considered an administrative cost, which is shared by a state agency and the Department of Agriculture.\u00a0"
