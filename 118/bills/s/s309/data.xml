  <summary date="2023-06-29T18:00:34Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Caribbean Border Counternarcotics Strategy Act

This bill provides statutory authority for the requirement for the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to include a Caribbean Border Counternarcotics Strategy in its National Drug Control Strategy. This strategy must include measures for preventing the illegal trafficking of drugs through the Caribbean region into the United States, including measures to combat drug trafficking and drug-related violent crime in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The bill also revises ONDCP's authorization to (1) add definitions for state and for United States to specify that its authorization includes U.S. territories and possessions, and (2) revise the definition for supply reduction to ensure that the National Drug Control Strategy includes efforts to disrupt the financial networks of drug trafficking organizations.</summary>
