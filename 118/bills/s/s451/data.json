Specifically, the bill requires the President to impose sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act upon (1) Iranian persons who provide material, tactical, or operational support for Russian activities against Ukraine, and (2) Iranian financial institutions that facilitate transactions with Russian persons who provide material, tactical, or operational support for Russian activities against Ukraine.\n\nThe bill also requires the President to certify to Congress, before removing an Iranian person from the Department of the Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, that the person did not sell defense articles to Russia for one year prior to certification. The President must also certify that Iran is no longer providing material or financial support to Russia before revoking Iran's designation as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern."
