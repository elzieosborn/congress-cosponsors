These changes, effective May 1, 2023, revised the fee charts that provide percentage adjustments based on a mortgagor's credit score and down payment.\n\nThe bill reinstates the fee structure that was in place prior to May 1, 2023.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the changes made by the FHFA. Further adjustments to the fee structure by FHFA are prohibited until 90 days after the publication of the GAO report.\n\nAfter this period, FHFA must follow Administrative Procedure Act requirements when proposing adjustments to the fee structure.\n\nThe bill also requires that, to the greatest extent feasible, revisions to the fee schedule must be based on risk.\n\nFurther, FHFA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are prohibited from imposing any loan-level pricing adjustment fee that is based on the ratio of the debt of the mortgagor to the income of the mortgagor."
