(Under the 7(a) Program, the SBA provides business loans and loan guaranties to small business borrowers unable to obtain financing elsewhere.)\n\nThe SBA must expand authorization for providing 7(a) loans to lenders that meet the criteria to make such loans but have not otherwise been approved to do so. Such lenders must ensure that at least 50% of loans they make that are guaranteed pursuant to the bill are made to small businesses in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods."
