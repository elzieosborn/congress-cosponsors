This bill expands a grant program established to provide charter schools with facilities financing. Among other changes, the bill expands the allowable uses of a grant and revises the selection criteria for a grant. For example, the Department of Education must consider the extent to which the activities proposed to be carried out under a grant will increase charter schools' access to public buildings.</summary>
