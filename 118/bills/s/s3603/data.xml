This bill establishes a pilot program to facilitate information sharing between federal entities and private sector entities regarding illicit finance (i.e., financial transactions involving the proceeds of unlawful activity as specified by the bill).

Specifically, the Department of Justice (DOJ) must establish a pilot program for information sharing between the private sector and the DOJ, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about potential violations, threats, and risks regarding illicit finance.

The DOJ, in consultation with FinCEN and DHS, must designate private sector entities in the money service business and in the crypto asset industry to participate in the pilot program. Additionally, one or more information sharing and analysis centers may also be selected to participate in the pilot program. Participation in the pilot program is voluntary.

The bill limits the liability of designated private sector entities in the context of sharing or disclosing information under this bill.</summary>
