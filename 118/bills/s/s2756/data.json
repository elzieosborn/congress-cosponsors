    "text": "Streamlining Organic Research Act of 2023\n\nThis bill expands Department of Agriculture (USDA) support for organic agricultural\u00a0research.\n\nUSDA must establish the Coordinating and Expanding Organic Research Initiative for USDA resources dedicated to organic agricultural research. Every five years, the initiative must survey USDA's organic agricultural research and produce a report, including findings and recommendations on expanding research and increasing coordination. USDA must take the findings and recommendations into consideration when preparing USDA's annual budget recommendations.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes\u00a0the\u00a0National Institute of Food and Agriculture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00a0Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative through FY2028. Further, eligible grant projects are expanded to include (1) facilitating the identification and adoption of traditional ecological knowledge; (2) developing cultural practices and other allowable alternatives to substances recommended for removal from the National List of approved and prohibited substances for organic production; and\u00a0(3) identifying how organic agriculture can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, build landscape resiliency, and facilitate other related ecosystem services.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives of the Economic Research Service (ERS) through FY2028. ERS must conduct an economic impact analysis of organic agricultural management conducted in accordance with the National Organic Program and submit a report to Congress.\n\nUSDA may make competitive grants to support research, education, and extension activities relating to the transition from nonorganic into organic agricultural production systems.\u00a0\n\nFurther, the Agricultural Research Service must submit a report to Congress on the resources needed to increase the research conducted on certified organic agricultural land."
