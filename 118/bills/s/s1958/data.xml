This bill defines the standards that apply to sustainable aviation fuel at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The FAA must issue or revise regulations as necessary to provide that the bill's definition of sustainable aviation fuel applies to (1) all aircraft flown to, from, or within the United States; and (2) all programs established, administered, or overseen by the FAA.

Under the bill, sustainable aviation fuel means liquid fuel, the portion of which is not kerosene, which (1) meets specific international standards, (2) is not derived from coprocessing specific materials (e.g., triglycerides) with a non-biomass feedstock, (3) is not derived from palm fatty acid distillates or petroleum, and (4) is certified as having a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction percentage of at least 50% compared with petroleum-based jet fuel (based on specific standards and agreements).</summary>
