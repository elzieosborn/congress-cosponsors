Priority must be given to organizations that serve individuals who are in jurisdictions that have banned or severely restricted abortion access or who travel to another jurisdiction for an abortion, or organizations that have or plan to have programs in place that help individuals access abortion services.\n\nIn order to qualify for a grant, organizations must assist individuals seeking abortions through unbiased and medically and factually accurate programs, services, or activities. Organizations may not discourage individuals from seeking abortions. Additionally, federal entities that implement the grant program may not participate in any state, tribal, or local antiabortion proceedings (e.g., prosecutions) in connection with grant services.\n\n\u00a0"
