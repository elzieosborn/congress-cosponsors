Eligible grantees include (1) state, tribal, and local governments; (2) health care providers; and (3) organizations that serve pregnant and postpartum individuals.\n\nSecond, the Department of Health and Human Services may award grants to grow and diversify the maternal mental and behavioral health workforce by establishing or expanding schools and training programs."
