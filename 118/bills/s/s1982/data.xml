This bill modifies requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Space Transportation Infrastructure Matching Grants Program. The program supported the development of spaceports (e.g., testing and launching stations for spacecraft) and other space-related infrastructure.

Under current law, a grant may cover a maximum of 50% of the total cost of a project; at least 10% must be paid for by the private sector. The bill removes the requirement of private sector contributions and increases the maximum amount that the grant may cover to 90% of a project's total cost. The bill also allows the FAA to waive the maximum cost limitations if it deems it to be in the national interest.

Additionally, under the bill, in selecting grant recipients, the FAA may consider a project's contribution towards meeting the civil, national security, and commercial space transportation needs of the United States (rather than only the needs of the U.S. government).

The bill also limits funding for the grant program to congressional appropriations; other funding sources, such as user fees, may not be used.</summary>
