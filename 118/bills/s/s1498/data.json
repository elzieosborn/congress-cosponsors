If DOD delays in submitting or executing the plan, the travel budget of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy must be decreased by 1% for every two days of delay.\n\nDOD must work with the Defense Logistics Agency to execute the plan until DOD is no longer incurring any costs to maintain, store, or protect the excess materials.\n\nAny state requesting border wall construction materials must certify, in writing, that the materials will be used exclusively for the construction of a permanent physical barrier to stop illicit human and vehicle trafficking along the border. If a state does not use all such materials for the specified purpose within two years of receiving the materials, the state must pay the federal government an amount equal to the original purchase price of the materials."
