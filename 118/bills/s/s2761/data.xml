This bill requires the President to apply certain duties to all products from China if any Chinese entities, including the People's Liberation Army, have engaged in an act that violated the sovereignty or territorial integrity of Taiwan during the past year. The President must certify annually whether such actions&#160;occurred.

The President may waive the application of duties (subject to a congressional joint resolution of disapproval) for one year if the President determines that a waiver is in the U.S. national interest.

The Department of Commerce must also assess and report to Congress on U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities and risk exposure to China.</summary>
