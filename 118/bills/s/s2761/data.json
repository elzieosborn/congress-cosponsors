The President must certify annually whether such actions\u00a0occurred.\n\nThe President may waive the application of duties (subject to a congressional joint resolution of disapproval) for one year if the President determines that a waiver is in the U.S. national interest.\n\nThe Department of Commerce must also assess and report to Congress on U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities and risk exposure to China."
