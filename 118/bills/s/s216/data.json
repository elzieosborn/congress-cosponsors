The VA must waive the reassessment requirement under specified circumstances, such as when a veteran's serious injury is caused by a degenerative or chronic condition.\n\nThe VA is authorized to award grants to implement, coordinate, improve, or enhance mental health counseling, treatment, or support for family caregivers of veterans participating in the family caregiver program.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the provision of mental health support to caregivers of veterans."
