Furthermore, the bill establishes new grant programs for states to (1) link health care and social services for older adults and adults with disabilities, including through medical-legal partnerships and legal services hotlines; and (2) prevent and address social isolation among older adults and adults with disabilities.\n\nThe bill also provides funding for reporting by the Department of Health and Human Services on the effectiveness of various programs and activities in addressing abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older adults and adults with disabilities."
