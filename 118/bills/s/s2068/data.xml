This bill allows for the registration of national venture securities exchanges for the purpose of trading the securities of certain small companies, such as startups and emerging growth companies. Individuals and existing national securities exchanges may apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval to register such an exchange, or to register a listing tier within an existing exchange.

The bill sets forth requirements for these venture exchanges, including required disclosures, trading limits, and trading privileges.</summary>
