    "text": "SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act of 2023\n\nThis bill amends how U.S. poverty levels are determined and amends the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nThe Bureau of the Census must (1) collect specified data regarding the receipt of federal benefits and individual income, and (2) use the data to provide an alternative poverty measure. The bill also establishes a Commission on Valuation of Federal Benefits to recommend the valuation of specific federal benefits for the purpose of estimating\u00a0the Federal Poverty Level.\n\nThis bill expands the applicability of the work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). (These individuals have further work requirements in addition to the general SNAP work-related requirements.)\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, this bill applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 64 years old (currently this applies to those not over 50 years old). The bill also limits the ABAWD exclusion for a parent or other member of a household with responsibility for a dependent child to those with responsibility\u00a0for a child\u00a0under the age of six, which means that those with a child\u00a0over the age of six\u00a0must fulfill the work-related requirements.\u00a0Further, the bill allows married individuals with a dependent over the age of six\u00a0to jointly fulfill hour-based work requirements.\n\nEach state participating in SNAP must contribute specified matching funds for Department of Agriculture program administration funding contributions. The required match begins at 10% for FY2023 and increases annually until it reaches 50% for FY2031 and each subsequent fiscal year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe bill also addresses potential fraud in SNAP by, among other things, requiring SNAP beneficiaries to participate in fraud investigations and establishing penalties (e.g., benefit suspensions)\u00a0for unauthorized uses of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards."
