This bill extends for 180 days Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance allowing broker-dealers to receive payments for research services provided to investment managers. Under current law, broker-dealers that receive payments for performing this service must register as investment advisors. However, the SEC through guidance currently waives enforcement against these broker-dealers. This waiver is set to expire on July 3, 2023.

The SEC must report on the impact of continuation or expiration of this guidance.</summary>
