Under current law, broker-dealers that receive payments for performing this service must register as investment advisors. However, the SEC through guidance currently waives enforcement against these broker-dealers. This waiver is set to expire on July 3, 2023.\n\nThe SEC must report on the impact of continuation or expiration of this guidance."
