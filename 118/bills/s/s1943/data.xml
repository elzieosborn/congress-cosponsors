This bill establishes policy on the preferred architecture of federal public buildings. For example, the bill establishes that (1) traditional and classical architecture is the preferred style for federal public buildings, and (2) classical architecture is the default and preferred style for federal public buildings in the District of Columbia.

The bill also establishes a Council on Improving Federal Civic Architecture to evaluate and advise the General Services Administration (GSA) on the design of new and existing federal public buildings. If GSA approves a design that diverges from preferred architecture, it must notify Congress and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.</summary>
