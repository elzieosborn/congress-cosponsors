This bill revises the requirements for calculating Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.

The bill increases the minimum SNAP benefit and requires benefits to be calculated using the value of a low-cost food plan. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) must determine the requirements for the low-cost food plan, which is the diet required to feed a family of four, consisting of

a man and a woman ages 19-50 years,a child ages 6-8 years, anda child ages 9-11 years.USDA must (1) reevaluate and publish the market baskets of the plan by December 31, 2029, and every five years thereafter, based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance; and (2) make adjustments to the plan to account for household size, changes in the cost of the diet, and the costs of food in specified areas.

The bill modifies the requirements for calculating household income to determine SNAP eligibility by (1) authorizing a standard medical expense deduction for households containing an elderly or disabled member, and (2) eliminating the cap on the excess shelter expense deduction.&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;

The bill eliminates certain work requirements for SNAP; the requirements apply to able-bodied adults who are ages 18-49 and have no dependent children.

The bill allows Puerto Rico to participate in SNAP. Currently, Puerto Rico receives a block grant instead of participating in SNAP. The bill also provides funding for Puerto Rico to receive a one-time USDA grant for the technology infrastructure necessary to implement SNAP.</summary>
