This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue a final rule establishing evacuation standards for transport category airplanes.

In issuing the rule, the FAA must consider the impact of certain factors on the safe and efficient evacuation of an airplane. These factors include

 the ability of passengers of different ages (e.g., infants, children, and senior citizens); the ability of passengers with disabilities; the ability of passengers who do not speak English; and seat size, seat pitch, and aisle width.</summary>
