  <summary date="2024-05-28T18:39:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Realizing Equitable &amp; Sustainable Participation in Emerging Cannabis Trades Resolution or the RESPECT Resolution

This resolution encourages states and localities to adopt best practices and take bold steps to address disparities in the cannabis marketplace and to address, reverse, and repair the effects of the war on drugs on communities of color. The resolution also expresses the sense that&#160;the President should direct the U.S. Mission to the United Nations and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs to seek to treat cannabis as a legal commodity.</summary>
