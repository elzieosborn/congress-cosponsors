The resolution also (1) supports the right of the people of Ukraine to freely determine their future, and (2) calls upon and commends the Biden Administration for assembling and working with an international coalition of the world's leading nations to ensure that all nations refuse to recognize Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and to ensure that Russia is held accountable.</summary>
