  <summary date="2023-02-14T17:54:17Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution recognizes (1) the Greensboro Four for their contributions to the Civil Rights Movement and the significant role they played as a catalyst for the formation of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, (2) the value of ethnic and racial diversity in the United States, and (3) the continued importance of sit-ins as an effective form of nonviolent resistance. The resolution also encourages states to include information about the Greensboro Four in their educational curriculums.</summary>
