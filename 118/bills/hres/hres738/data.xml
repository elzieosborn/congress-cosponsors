  <summary date="2024-06-06T17:57:35Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution recognizes the goal of the education system shall be that virtually every American student be able to read at grade level or better.

Additionally, the resolution encourages literacy programs to be set up to include one-on-one tutoring for each student diagnosed with a literacy gap of one year or more. The resolution encourages this one-on-one tutoring to be five days per week until the student is reading at grade level.&#160;

The resolution also encourages state and local government agencies working with private organizations with proven literacy programs to (1) work together to identify and establish solutions to illiteracy, and (2) establish adult literacy programs to help adults who have reading gaps below 8th grade.</summary>
