The resolution encourages this one-on-one tutoring to be five days per week until the student is reading at grade level.\u00a0\n\nThe resolution also encourages state and local government agencies working with private organizations with proven literacy programs to (1) work together to identify and establish solutions to illiteracy, and (2) establish adult literacy programs to help adults who have reading gaps below 8th grade."
