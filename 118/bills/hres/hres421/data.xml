  <summary date="2023-10-27T15:25:26Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution condemns the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for knowingly and intentionally manipulating its currency. The resolution also (1) supports the actions by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China in 2019, and (2) calls on the Biden administration to take similar action to hold the CCP accountable for their present-day efforts to manipulate their currency.</summary>
