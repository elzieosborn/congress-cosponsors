It also expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that (1) hydropower is a necessary part of an all-of-the-above approach to energy development; (2) protecting the existing hydropower resources and establishing new ones are critical to national security; (3) increased hydropower production will lower energy prices for consumers, decrease the national carbon footprint, and enhance the resiliency of the U.S. power grid; and (4) hydro-hegemony will provide the United States with an edge over global competitors and foreign bad actors."
