  <summary date="2023-06-15T21:35:47Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution restricts access to the news media galleries in the House Chamber by representatives of media outlets that are affiliated with a foreign government, the family of the ruling monarch of a foreign country, or a foreign political party.

Specifically, the resolution bars access to the news media galleries by representatives of foreign state media outlets if they are not registered as foreign agents or otherwise fail to comply with applicable requirements for foreign agents. (Current law requires individuals who do political or advocacy work on behalf of foreign governments and other foreign entities to register with the Department of Justice and disclose certain information about their clients, activities, and contract terms.)

In addition, before being admitted to the news media galleries, representatives of foreign state media outlets must (1) certify that they have, within the prior six months, undergone a background check conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and (2) that the FBI determined they do not pose a threat to U.S. security.

Last, the resolution caps at 10 the number of reporters and correspondents from the same foreign state media outlet who may be admitted to the news media galleries.</summary>
