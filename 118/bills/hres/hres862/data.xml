  <summary date="2023-12-08T01:15:28Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution urges members of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to deny airport access and apply sanctions to certain Iranian airlines that are currently sanctioned by the United States.

The resolution also advises EU and NATO members to consider the risks of doing business with companies that facilitate Iran's global sponsorship of terrorism and reminds airports worldwide that sanctions applied against Iranian airlines could be applied to individuals or entities that provide material support to those airlines.</summary>
