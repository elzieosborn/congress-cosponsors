  <summary date="2024-11-19T15:12:55Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution supports the designation of Oxi Day in commemoration of Greece's refusal to submit to the Axis Powers during World War II and notes that this resistance likely led to the ultimate defeat of Nazi Germany. (Greece's Prime Minister at the time, Ioannis Metaxas, had responded to Italy's demand for surrender with the&#160;single word Oxi! or No!)</summary>
