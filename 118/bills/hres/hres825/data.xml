  <summary date="2024-03-22T15:21:18Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution calls on campus administrators to do the following:

 condemn all forms of antisemitism on college campuses; ensure Jewish faculty, students, and guests can exercise the same free speech rights as are guaranteed to all other faculty, students, and guests without intimidation; ensure that no speaker is prevented from speaking on campus because of their Jewish heritage; ensure Jewish students have the same opportunities as all other students on campus; and ensure the security and safety of their Jewish students. The resolution also supports the right of Americans to freely exercise their religious and cultural beliefs while pursuing higher education.</summary>
