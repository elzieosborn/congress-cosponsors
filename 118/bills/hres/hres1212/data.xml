  <summary date="2024-12-04T20:17:46Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that&#160;canceling classes and commencements in response to unlawful encampments is unacceptable and unfair to the majority of students. The resolution also (1)&#160;condemns any negotiation where a university changes its policy in response to the demands of those occupying illegal encampments, and (2) calls on universities to work with local law enforcement to immediately clear tent encampments from university property and restore safe learning environments on their campuses.</summary>
