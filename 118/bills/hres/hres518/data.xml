  <summary date="2024-01-02T20:48:07Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution supports parents having a say in their child's education.

Further, the resolution opposes (1) allowing biological boys and men to compete in biological girls and women's sports, (2) the weakening of the protections of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and (3) labeling parents as extreme and hateful for wanting to keep inappropriate material out of their child's classroom.

Under title IX, if a school operates or sponsors an athletic program it must provide equal athletic opportunities regardless of sex.</summary>
