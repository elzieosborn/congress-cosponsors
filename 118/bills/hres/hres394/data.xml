(The agreement established basic policy and terms for the sale of Polaris missiles by the United States to the United Kingdom, and formed a basis of cooperation between the two countries on strategic nuclear defense and deterrence.)

The resolution also commends the Royal Navy for maintaining a continuous at-sea deterrent and reaffirms the United Kingdom as a valued ally of the United States.</summary>
