The resolution also recognizes the protection of the Israeli people against Hamas rocket attacks as a matter of importance and calls upon the House of Representatives to account for Israel's need for interceptor missiles when authorizing or appropriating funds to respond to Hamas' October 7, 2023, attacks against Israel.&#160;</summary>
