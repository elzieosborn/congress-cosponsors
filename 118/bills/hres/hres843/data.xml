  <summary date="2024-11-15T22:24:38Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution reaffirms the U.S-Philippine alliance and condemns Chinese actions against Philippine assets in the South China Sea.&#160;The resolution celebrates the longstanding alliance and partnership between the United States and the Philippines, reaffirms support for the Philippines in the face of Chinese aggression, and affirms that the United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty (signed in 1951) applies to armed attacks on Philippine military or public vessels in the South China Sea.

The resolution also (1) calls on China not to advance its territorial and sovereignty claims in the South China Sea; (2) condemns China's use of gray zone tactics (military provocations short of armed hostilities) and its use of lasing, water cannons, and ramming against Philippine vessels in the South China Sea; and (3) calls on China to end its aggressive behavior.</summary>
