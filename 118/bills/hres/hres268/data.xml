  <summary date="2023-10-27T21:45:44Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution calls on (1) all other countries to cease and desist from implementing any digital services tax and to immediately stop unfairly targeting U.S. companies, and (2) U.S. government agencies to use all available methods and resources to protect U.S. companies from the discriminatory effects of digital services taxes. It also supports Congress looking at additional tools to address tax discrimination among U.S. trading partners, including tax countermeasures.</summary>
