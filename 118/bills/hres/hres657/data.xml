  <summary date="2023-10-13T18:39:19Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution condemns racism and invidious discrimination as evil and antithetical to the U.S. Constitution and declares unconditional war on racism and invidious discrimination in America. (Invidious discrimination generally refers to discrimination based on a classification that is arbitrary or irrational and not related to a legitimate purpose.)

The resolution also expresses the intention of the House of Representatives to pass legislation establishing a Cabinet-level Department of Reconciliation. The department shall be charged with developing and coordinating the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to eliminate racism and invidious discrimination.</summary>
