  <summary date="2024-10-21T14:30:43Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution strongly condemns (1) the rise of antisemitism on campuses of institutions of higher education (IHEs) across the United States, and (2) administrators of IHEs who have enabled ongoing antisemitism&#160;on their campuses.

The resolution also urges the Department of Education to take necessary actions to ensure that IHEs are complying with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that students, including Jewish students, are not experiencing discrimination in violation of Title VI. (Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities.)

The resolution urges the executive branch&#160;to withhold federal funds from IHEs that are not complying with Title VI or are enabling protests that result in discrimination in violation of Title VI.</summary>
