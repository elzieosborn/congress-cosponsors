This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Representative Adam Schiff should not have access to classified information and should be investigated by the Committee on Ethics for actions taken in an attempt to tarnish the reputation of former President Donald Trump. The resolution further expresses the sense that comments made by Representative Adam Schiff during any congressional proceeding that addressed collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign should be struck from the record.</summary>
