This resolution permits Members to object to the consideration of legislation that authorizes or appropriates funding for programs unless the legislation includes a table (in a machine-readable format) that details the funding. The table must account for (1) the total amount, and the amount per fiscal year, of the funding; and (2) estimates of the affect (if any) of the funding on the cost of servicing the public debt.

An objection raised on these grounds may not be waived.</summary>
