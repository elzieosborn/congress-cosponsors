  <summary date="2024-11-14T17:22:32Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution commemorates the anniversary of death of Mahsa Amini and the protesters killed or detained in Iran since September 2022. It also supports the rights of women and of all people in Iran, and calls on Iran to end repression and to release all those detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in connection with the protests.

(Mahsa Amini was a 22-year old Iranian woman who died in police custody on September 16, 2022, after reportedly being arrested for wearing her hijab too loosely.)</summary>
