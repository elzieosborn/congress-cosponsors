  <summary date="2023-07-28T14:13:32Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution condemns the Sinaloa Cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and other similarly situated Mexican drug cartels. The resolution also calls for such cartels to be designated as foreign terrorist organizations and for the Biden Administration to freeze their financial assets.

(A designation as a foreign terrorist organization triggers various penalties on the organization's members, such as asset freezes and immigration restrictions.)</summary>
