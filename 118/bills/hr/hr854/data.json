Edge Gold Star Spouse Equity Act\n\nThis bill addresses restrictions on benefits for surviving spouses of service members.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits the termination of the payment of an annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan for certain surviving spouses of service members who died while on active duty solely because the surviving spouse remarries. The Department of Defense must resume payment of an annuity to surviving spouses who remarried before the age of 55 and before the enactment of this bill.\n\nThe remarriage of a surviving spouse of a veteran does not bar the provision of dependency and indemnity compensation, regardless of their age when they remarried. The Department of Veterans Affairs must resume payment of dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving spouses who remarried before the age of 57 prior to the enactment of this bill."
