The accrediting agency may not prohibit the IHE from requiring an applicant, student, employee, or independent contractor to provide a statement of faith or adhere to a code of conduct.\n\nThe bill specifies that an IHE shall be eligible to participate in federal student aid programs if the IHE is in compliance with the standards of the accrediting agency that assesses the IHE in accordance with statute."
