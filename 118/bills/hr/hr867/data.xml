This bill establishes the National Commission on Renaming the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Headquarters Building. The commission must make recommendations for redesignating the building that reflect certain considerations, including the mission of the FBI, the values of the U.S. Constitution, and racial, ethnic, and gender diversity.
