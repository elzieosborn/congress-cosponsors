    "text": "DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act\n\nThis bill restricts funding to an institution of higher education (IHE) that has a relationship with a Confucius Institute (a cultural institute directly or indirectly funded by the Chinese government). It also requires certain disclosures related to Chinese entities of concern (generally, universities or colleges involved in China's military, police, or intelligence activities).\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must ensure that an IHE that has awarded a contract to, entered into an agreement with, or received an in-kind donation or gift from a Confucius Institute is ineligible to receive specified funds from DHS, unless the IHE terminates the relationship. The IHE may regain eligibility for these funds upon termination of the relationship. DHS may waive this funding restriction, on a case-by-case basis and for a period of not more than one year, if it is in the national security interests of the United States.\n\nAdditionally, an IHE that has a relationship with a Chinese entity of concern and is seeking to receive or receives specified DHS funds must notify DHS about the relationship.\n\nDHS must provide outreach and, upon request, technical assistance to IHEs related to compliance with this bill."
