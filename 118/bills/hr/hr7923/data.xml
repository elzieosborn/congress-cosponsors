This bill prohibits the Department of Agriculture (USDA) from providing financial assistance for certain projects that would result in the conversion of covered farmland for solar energy production.

Under the bill, covered farmland generally refers to prime farmland, unique farmland, and farmland that is of statewide or local importance. Conversion means any activity that results in the covered farmland no longer meeting certain requirements for agricultural production, activity, or use.

The bill includes an exception for certain smaller projects that have the approval or support from the local county and municipality. Any project that receives financial assistance from USDA under an exception must (1) develop a mitigation and remediation plan for the project (e.g., implementing best practices to protect future soil health and productivity), and (2) ensure that sufficient funds are provided for the decommissioning of the solar energy production system and the remediation and restoration of the farmland.</summary>
