The estimate must also (1) incorporate the inflationary impact of the debt servicing costs associated with the executive order; and (2) take into account the spending patterns of military personnel and of residents of non-metropolitan areas, including rural areas and farm households.\n\nThe requirements do not apply to executive orders that (1) provide for emergency assistance or relief at the request of any state or local government or an official of the government, or (2) are necessary for national security or the ratification or implementation of international treaty obligations."
