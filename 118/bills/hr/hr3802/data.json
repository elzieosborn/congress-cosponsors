    "text": "Precipitation Forecasting for Agriculture Act\n\nThis bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a pilot program that supports precipitation forecasts for agriculture in the central United States.\n\nSpecifically, NOAA must establish at least one pilot program within the\u00a0U.S. Weather Research Program to improve subseasonal and seasonal precipitation forecasts for agriculture in the central states, including modeling improvements with respect to soil moisture, flash droughts, and large-scale seasonal events. The program must utilize existing resources within\u00a0NOAA and implement certain prior recommendations from the National Weather Service regarding subseasonal and seasonal forecasts.\u00a0"
