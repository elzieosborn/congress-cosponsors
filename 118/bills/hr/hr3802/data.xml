This bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a pilot program that supports precipitation forecasts for agriculture in the central United States.

Specifically, NOAA must establish at least one pilot program within the&#160;U.S. Weather Research Program to improve subseasonal and seasonal precipitation forecasts for agriculture in the central states, including modeling improvements with respect to soil moisture, flash droughts, and large-scale seasonal events. The program must utilize existing resources within&#160;NOAA and implement certain prior recommendations from the National Weather Service regarding subseasonal and seasonal forecasts.&#160;</summary>
