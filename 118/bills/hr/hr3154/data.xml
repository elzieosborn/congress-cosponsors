This bill prohibits making preparations for an explosive nuclear weapons test unless (1) the President details any change to the condition of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile from the previous year, and (2) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the test.

Further, the bill declares it to be U.S. policy that the United States should lead international negotiations on specific arms-reduction measures.</summary>
