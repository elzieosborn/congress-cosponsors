Additionally, no such individuals may be subject to adverse action solely on the basis of a refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAt the request of an individual who was involuntarily separated from an Armed Force solely because of a refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, the military department concerned must\n\n reinstate the individual as a member of the Armed Force in the same rank and grade the individual held at the time of separation, expunge from the individual's military service record any reference to adverse action related to the refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, and include the period between the involuntary separation and reinstatement in the computation of retired or retainer pay of the individual. The bill requires that the discharge of members due to the failure to obey a lawful order to receive a COVID-19 vaccination must be categorized as an honorable discharge, including for individuals who were discharged prior to the enactment of this bill."
