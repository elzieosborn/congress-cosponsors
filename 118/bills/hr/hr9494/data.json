    "text": "Continuing Appropriations and Other Matters Act, 2025\n\nThis bill provides continuing FY2025 appropriations for federal agencies, provides emergency funding for disaster relief, extends various expiring programs and authorities, and modifies voter registration requirements for federal elections.\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides continuing FY2025 appropriations to federal agencies through the earlier of March 28, 2025, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2025 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2025 begins on October 1, 2024.\u00a0\n\nThe CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2024 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs. For example, the bill provides (1) additional funding to the Department of Defense (DOD) for the Virginia Class Submarine program, and (2) emergency funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Disaster Relief Fund.\n\nIn addition, the bill extends several expiring programs and authorities, including\n\nthe National Flood Insurance Program,the Department of Agriculture's Livestock Mandatory Reporting program,DOD's authority to use funds for certain military construction projects, andthe authority for states to use timber sale revenues received under Good Neighbor Agreements.\u00a0The bill also prohibits states from accepting and processing an application to register to vote in a federal election unless the applicant presents documentary proof of U.S. citizenship.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
