Currently, only large bank holding companies that are public companies are required to establish risk committees and, by regulation, have chief risk officers. Under the bill, risk committees and chief risk officers are also required for (1) privately-held large bank holding companies, and (2) large banks that do not have a holding company.\n\nFurther, the Federal Reserve Board is allowed to require smaller bank holding companies to establish a risk committee and appoint a chief risk officer. Currently, the board is allowed to require smaller bank companies that are public companies establish risk committees.\n\nChief risk officers are responsible for the establishment of risk limits, monitoring compliance, and reporting any deficiencies to the risk committee."
