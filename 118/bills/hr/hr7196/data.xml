This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the impacts of seasonal and nonresident home ownership on data collected by the Bureau of the Census&#160;and the distribution of federal funding.

In carrying out the study, the&#160;GAO must place special focus on rural Appalachia and coastal communities.

If the GAO finds a negative effect between levels of seasonal and non-permanent resident home ownership and federal funding distribution, it must provide recommendations with respect to remedying the negative effect.</summary>
