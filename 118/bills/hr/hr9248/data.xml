This bill provides states with the authority to adopt or enact any law, regulation, order, or other requirement limiting the duration that a railroad carrier may block a highway-rail grade crossing. Specifically, this bill states that federal transportation laws do not preempt a state from adopting or enacting these limits.&#160;

As background, state and federal courts have generally found that state laws regarding obstructed crossings are preempted by one or more federal laws, thereby&#160;rendering the state laws&#160;unenforceable.</summary>
