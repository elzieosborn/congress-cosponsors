  <summary date="2024-06-28T18:51:10Z" status="Reported to House">Hiring Preference for Veterans and Americans With Disabilities Act

This bill allows states and local jurisdictions to give a hiring preference (when hiring election workers to administer an election in the state or local jurisdiction) to veterans, individuals with a disability, and nonresident military spouses or dependents.

Further, the bill prohibits states and local jurisdictions from refusing to hire a nonresident military spouse or dependent as an election worker solely on the grounds that the individual does not maintain a place of residence in the state or local jurisdiction. &#160; &#160;</summary>
