This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to establish the BioBonds Program to support loans for clinical trials for eligible drugs and medical devices for unmet medical needs.

Under the program, fiscal agents purchase loans (up to $25 million per recipient) and issue collateralized bonds that are sold to investors and that are guaranteed by Treasury.&#160;An eligible borrower under this program is one conducting (or seeking to conduct) research related to a drug or device that is (1) intended to meet an unmet medical need; and (2) under investigation in certain types of controlled clinical trials, including a trial to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device.&#160;

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Treasury must report on the program; GAO must also study whether similar programs should be established for other biomedical research projects.
