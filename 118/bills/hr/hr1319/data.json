Interior and USDA shall\n\n develop a process to allow members of the public to comment regarding the identification of trails and areas; and consider the identification, development, and completion of long-distance bike trails in a geographically equitable manner. The Department concerned shall ensure that each identified long-distance bike trail or area does not conflict with\n\n the uses of any trail or road that is part of that long-distance bike trail; multiple-use areas where biking, hiking, horseback riding, or use by pack and saddle stock are existing uses; the purposes for which any trail was or is established under the National Trails System Act; and any area managed under the Wilderness Act. The Department concerned shall also ensure that each identified long-distance trail or area complies with land use and management plans of the federal recreational lands that are part of that long-distance bike trail."
