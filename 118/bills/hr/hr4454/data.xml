  <summary date="2025-02-11T13:31:23Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires each application for electronic surveillance or physical search court orders under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to contain a designated senior official's certification that none of the information used in support of the application was derived solely from a political organization's research on an opposing political candidate. Such information may be used if (1) the political organization that produced the information is clearly identified, and (2) other clearly identified investigate techniques have been used to corroborate the information.</summary>
