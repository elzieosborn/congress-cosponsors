  <summary date="2023-07-28T15:20:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Rural Internet Improvement Act of 2023

This bill merges the pilot ReConnect Loan and Grant Program with existing loans and grants provided by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to facilitate broadband access to rural areas that lack sufficient access to broadband. Unobligated amounts available for the pilot program must be transferred and made available, without further appropriations, to this merged program.

The bill specifies eligibility criteria and other requirements that apply to the merged program. For example, the bill limits funds from the merged program to projects in areas where at least 90% of the households lack sufficient access to broadband services, which is currently required under the pilot program.

Other changes in the bill address procedures for contesting the accuracy of broadband maps that are used to identify eligible areas. It also requires efforts to increase coordination concerning broadband initiatives between USDA, the Federal Communications Commission, and the National Telecommunications Information Administration.</summary>
