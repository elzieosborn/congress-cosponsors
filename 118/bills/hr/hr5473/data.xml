  <summary date="2023-12-04T19:47:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Promoting Resilient Buildings Act of 2023

This bill modifies two Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster preparedness and mitigation programs to allow grants to be used to implement the two latest published editions of building codes instead of only the latest edition.

Specifically, the bill allows (1) grants under the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program to continue to be used to implement the two latest editions indefinitely; and (2) capitalization grants under the Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund Program to be used to implement the two latest editions instead of only the latest edition.</summary>
