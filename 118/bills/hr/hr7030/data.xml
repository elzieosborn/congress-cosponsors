This bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to review its final rules every five years to determine if revision is necessary or appropriate to facilitate capital formation, to maintain fair and orderly markets, and for investor protection. The SEC must periodically report to Congress on this effort.

When engaged in rulemaking, the SEC must consider whether a new rule will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation when considered cumulatively with other rules and regulations.</summary>
