This bill expressly transfers to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) the responsibility for administering the Strategic National Stockpile and related activities. (The Strategic National Stockpile consists of drugs, vaccines, medical products, and other supplies that may be deployed to respond to public health emergencies.)

Current law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the stockpile in collaboration with ASPR and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, ASPR assumed general responsibility for overseeing the stockpile in 2018.</summary>
