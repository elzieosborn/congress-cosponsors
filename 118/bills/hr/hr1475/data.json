    "text": "Hospital Adoption Education Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop resources to promote the understanding of adoption in the health care industry.\n\nSpecifically, HHS must develop and disseminate digital resources about adoption for the health care industry, including best practices for interacting with prospective birth mothers and adoptive families. In addition, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) must maintain resources on its website for health care workers to improve their awareness and understanding of adoption.\n\nThe ACF must also provide professional development (and related consultation services) about families pursuing adoption for care providers at hospitals and birthing centers. The ACF may carry out these activities directly or through grants or contracts with education organizations that are health care-based and focused on adoption. However, the ACF may not award grants to or enter contracts with (1) agencies that place newborn children for adoption or in foster care, or (2) organizations that provide abortion services."
