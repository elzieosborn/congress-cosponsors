The Office of Competition and Innovation replaced the Office of Innovation in 2022. The original Office of Innovation was established in 2018.\n\nThe restored Office of Innovation must reestablish the compliance assistance sandbox policy (providing a safe harbor from certain liability laws while an approved financial product or service is in a testing phase) and the no action letter policy (ensuring no supervisory or enforcement action against an approved financial product or service in certain circumstances)."
