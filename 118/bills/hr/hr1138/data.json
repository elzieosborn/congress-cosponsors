Additionally, the prohibition does not apply to assets held in a qualified blind trust.\n\nAny profit stemming from a prohibited holding or transaction must be disgorged to the Treasury and may subject the Member to a civil fine. Additionally, a loss stemming from a prohibited holding or transaction may not be used as an income tax deduction.\n\nEach Member must submit an annual certification of compliance to the supervising ethics office. The office must publish each certification on a public website and periodically audit Members' compliance with the bill's provisions."
