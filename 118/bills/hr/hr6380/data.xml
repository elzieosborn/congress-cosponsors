This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a pilot program to award grants to up to 10 flight schools to provide flight training for eligible veterans. Under the bill, an&#160;eligible veteran&#160;includes an individual who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service and who was honorably discharged, meets the requirements to obtain at least a second class medical certificate, and certifies an intent to pursue a career as a commercial pilot.

Flight schools may use grants for (1) the provision of guidance and pilot training services (including tuition and flight training fees); (2) the provision of related books, training materials, and equipment; and (3) program administrative costs.

DOT must submit a report to Congress on the program and related issues.&#160;</summary>
