This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to establish a program to provide&#160;children with parents on active duty in the uniformed services with funds to pay educational expenses.

Specifically, ED must establish a tax-exempt Military Education Savings Account for dependent children of parents in the uniformed services for the payment of the children's educational expenses. Funds in the savings account may be used for specified purposes, including the cost of attendance at a private elementary or secondary school or institution of higher education, private tutoring, or costs associated with an apprenticeship or other vocational training program.</summary>
