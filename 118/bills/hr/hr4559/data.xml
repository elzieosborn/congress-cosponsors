 This bill prohibits the Department of Agriculture from purchasing any meat, meat food product, poultry, poultry food product, or processed food produced by workers in the United States who are compensated at a rate lower than the prevailing rate for wages and fringe benefits for such workers in their locality.

The Department of Labor must determine the prevailing rates and in determining such rates shall take into account any applicable existing collective bargaining agreements in the locality. A prevailing rate established pursuant to this bill must not supersede a worker's wages and benefits agreed to in a collective bargaining agreement.</summary>
