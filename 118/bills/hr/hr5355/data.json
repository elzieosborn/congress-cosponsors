(Fluorine-free foams do not contain any perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS.)\n\nSpecifically, the FAA reports must include information on the development and implementation of a national transition plan for a fluorine-free firefighting foam that meets certain performance standards for use at Part 139 airports (Part 139 airports include airports that serve scheduled and unscheduled air carrier operations for aircraft with more than 30 seats or serve scheduled air carrier operations for aircraft with 10-30 seats.)\n\nThe reports must also assess the progress in providing airports that are not Part 139 airports and local authorities with responsibility for inspection and oversight with guidance relating to\u00a0the use of fluorine-free firefighting foam at such airports.\u00a0\n\nThe FAA must submit a progress report to Congress every 180 days until the FAA completes the development and implementation of the national transition plan.\u00a0"
