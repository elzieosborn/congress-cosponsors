This bill directs the Department of the Interior to issue final regulations prohibiting the discharge of any firearm using ammunition other than nonlead ammunition on all lands and waters under the jurisdiction and control of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Interior must establish and annually update a list of nonlead ammunition.

The prohibition does not apply to (1) a government official or agent who is carrying out a statutory duty unrelated to the management of wildlife; (2) a state, local, tribal, or federal law enforcement officer, or the agent of such an officer, who is carrying out a statutory duty; or (3) an active member of the U.S. military who is carrying out official duties.

A person that knowingly violates the prohibition may be assessed a civil penalty by Interior of (1) no more than $500 for the first violation, and (2) no less than $1,000 or more than $5,000 for a second or subsequent violation.</summary>
