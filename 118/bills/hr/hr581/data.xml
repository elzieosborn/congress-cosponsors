This bill addresses the possession of classified materials by former elected federal officials.

Specifically, the bill requires an individual who formerly held an elected federal office to certify to the National Archives and Records Administration after leaving office that he or she does not possess any classified materials.

The bill establishes a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for an individual who does not submit the required certification or who submits a certification that contains false information.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence must ensure that there is established a mandatory procedure under which any classified material removed from a sensitive compartmented information facility shall be documented and tracked.</summary>
