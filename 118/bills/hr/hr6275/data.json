    "text": "Protecting Consumer Access to Generic Drugs Act of 2023\n\nThis bill prohibits the manufacturer of a brand-name, generic, or biosimilar drug from entering into certain agreements to resolve or settle a patent infringement claim in connection with the sale of a drug or biological product.\n\nSpecifically, such an agreement shall, with some exceptions, be a violation of the bill if the filer of a subsequent application to market a drug or biological product receives anything of value and agrees to limit or forego research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the subsequent drug or biological product. (Typically, a subsequent application seeks to market a generic or biosimilar version of a patented drug or biological product.)\n\nPenalties for violations of the bill include civil penalties and loss of the 180-day exclusivity period for a generic drug. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shall have exclusive authority to litigate to enforce the bill.\n\nWhen a generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer enters into an agreement with another drug manufacturer related to the manufacturing, marketing or sale of a drug, the manufacturers shall certify that the material they have given the FTC concerning the agreement contains (1) the complete agreement; and (2) any agreements related to the main agreement, including descriptions of any oral agreements or representations."
