  <summary date="2023-02-07T15:33:52Z" status="Introduced in House">Original Living Wage Act 

 This bill increases the federal minimum wage to the minimum hourly wage sufficient for a person working for 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, to earn an annual income 25.5% higher than the federal poverty threshold for a four-person household, with two children under age 18, and living in the 48 contiguous states. (Under current poverty thresholds, the national minimum wage would be set at approximately $15.64 per hour.)

 The Department of Labor must determine the minimum wage rate by June 1, 2023, and review it every four years. Labor may not adjust the minimum wage to a lower rate.</summary>
