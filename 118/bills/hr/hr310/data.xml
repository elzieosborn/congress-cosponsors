This bill prohibits a senior federal employee, his or her spouse, or dependent children from holding, purchasing, or selling certain financial instruments during the employee's term of service.

Any profit made in violation of the prohibition must be disgorged to the Treasury and may subject the individual to a civil fine. The bill also requires the submission of an annual certification of compliance and requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a compliance audit.

 A loss from a transaction or holding involving a covered financial instrument that is conducted in violation of this bill may not be deducted from the amount of income tax owed by the applicable senior federal employee, spouse, or dependent child.

A senior federal employee who holds or conducts a transaction involving a covered financial instrument in violation of this bill may be subject to a civil fine assessed by the supervising ethics office.</summary>
