This bill requires, as a condition for Medicare payment, specified electrodiagnostic services to be furnished by qualified facilities that comply with accreditation, training, and other quality control requirements, as established under the bill.

Specifically, the bill requires nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography tests to be furnished by facilities that are accredited by an organization that is approved by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). The accrediting organization must certify that the facility meets certain standards, including having a quality control program and requiring those who administer needle electromyography tests to have at least three months of specialized training.

The bill also establishes an advisory committee to support the CMS in developing appropriate facility standards.</summary>
