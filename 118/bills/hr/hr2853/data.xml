This bill establishes programs and requirements to support certain at-home services for Medicare beneficiaries.

For example, the bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to allow Medicare primary care providers to opt to receive a monthly capitated payment for up to five years for certain services instead of on a fee-for-service basis. Covered services include home services and wellness visits.

The CMS must also establish payments under Medicare for (1) home infusion services and equipment, including 24/7 nursing services; (2) staff-assisted home dialysis; and (3) travel and mailing costs associated with collecting specimens from at-home clinical laboratory tests.

The bill also authorizes the Health Resources and Services Administration to award grants to nonprofit health care entities and state and local health agencies to develop the home-based care workforce through training, recruitment, and placement in home-care models.</summary>
