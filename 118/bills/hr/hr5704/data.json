    "text": "Protecting Student Athletes From Concussions Act\n\nThis bill conditions each state's receipt of federal funds, beginning in FY2025, on the state's enforcement of specified\u00a0minimum requirements for the prevention and treatment of concussions in school-sponsored athletics and activities.\n\nEach local educational agency must develop and implement a standard plan for concussion safety and management that includes (1) the education of students, parents, and school personnel about concussions; (2) specified supports for each student recovering from a concussion; and (3) best practices designed to ensure the uniformity of safety standards, treatment, and management.\n\nEach public school must post on school grounds and\u00a0publish on the school website specified information\u00a0about concussions.\n\nIf any public school personnel suspects that a student has sustained a concussion during a school-sponsored activity, the student must be immediately removed from participation in that activity and prohibited from participating in school-sponsored athletic activities until the student submits a written release from a health care professional. Furthermore, the school personnel must\u00a0report all available information regarding the injury to a concussion management team that will confirm and report\u00a0details of the injury\u00a0to the student's parents.\n\nThe school's concussion management team shall consult with and make recommendations to relevant school personnel and the student to ensure that the student is receiving the appropriate academic supports."
