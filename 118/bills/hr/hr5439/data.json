DHS must brief the Senate and House homeland security committees on (1) the national risk management process activities undertaken pursuant to the strategy, and (2) the amounts and timeline for funding that DHS has determined would be necessary to address risks of cybersecurity threats and physical threats and successfully execute the full range of activities proposed by the strategy."
