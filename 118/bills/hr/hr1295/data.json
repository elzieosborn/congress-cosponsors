This requirement does not apply to jurisdictions that send a mail-in ballot to every registered voter.\n\nFurther, states and jurisdictions must ensure that polling places are accessible by public transportation, located in rural areas, and located on each branch campus of an institution of higher education.\n\nThe Election Assistance Commission must issue certain voluntary standards for early voting, including the nondiscriminatory geographic placement of polling places.\n\nFinally, states and jurisdictions must begin processing and scanning ballots cast during the early voting period at least 14 days prior to election day. However, states and jurisdictions cannot tabulate ballots before the polls close on election day unless the tabulation is necessary and performed in accordance with existing state law."
