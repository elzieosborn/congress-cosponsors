HHS must issue associated guidance and recommendations on improving men's health outcomes that include short-term and long-term objectives for disease prevention, health promotion, and other areas of concern.\n\nThe bill also requires studies and reports on men's health topics. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health must study men's use of health screenings and services, and the Government Accountability Office must report on the effectiveness of federal outreach related to men's health initiatives."
