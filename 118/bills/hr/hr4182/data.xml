This bill establishes the Office of Men's Health within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and requires other activities to improve men's health in the United States.

The office must support and promote men's health programs and initiatives, including by working with relevant federal agencies (e.g., the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs) and consulting with other HHS offices and agencies on activities related to men's health. HHS must issue associated guidance and recommendations on improving men's health outcomes that include short-term and long-term objectives for disease prevention, health promotion, and other areas of concern.

The bill also requires studies and reports on men's health topics. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health must study men's use of health screenings and services, and the Government Accountability Office must report on the effectiveness of federal outreach related to men's health initiatives.</summary>
