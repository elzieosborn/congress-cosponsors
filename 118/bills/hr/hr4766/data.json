    "text": "Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023 \n\nThis bill establishes a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins (digital assets which an issuer must redeem for a fixed monetary value).\n\nOnly permitted issuers are allowed to issue a payment stablecoin for use by U.S. persons. Permitted issuers must be a subsidiary of an insured depository institution, a federal-qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuer, or a state-qualified payment stablecoin issuer. In general, permitted issuers must be regulated by the appropriate federal regulator, however, state-qualified issuers must be regulated by an appropriate state regulator.\n\nPermitted issuers must maintain reserves backing the stablecoin on a one-to-one basis using assets as outlined by the bill, such as U.S. coins and currency or other assets regulators determine appropriate. Permitted issuers must also publicly disclose their redemption policy, establish redemption procedures, and publish on their website every month the details of the issuer's reserves.\n\nThe bill sets forth requirements for (1) the rehypothecation, or reusing, of such reserves; (2) providing custodial or safekeeping services for stablecoins or private keys; and (3) supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority over non-state qualified issuers.\n\nIn addition, the bill places a two-year moratorium on new endogenously collateralized stablecoins (i.e., stablecoins that rely on the value of another digital asset created or maintained by the same originator to maintain the fixed price).\n\nUnder the bill, permitted payment stablecoins are not considered securities under securities law."
