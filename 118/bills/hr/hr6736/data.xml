This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide certain relief to individuals whose promotions to a grade or rank in the Armed Forces of O-7 or higher were delayed by the Senate. Specifically, the bill applies to those individuals who were confirmed between December 5, 2023, and December 31, 2023.

The bill requires DOD to provide pay and benefits associated with the appointment retroactive to the later of (1) the date that is 30 days after the date on which the nomination was placed on the Executive Calendar of the Senate, or (2) the date on which the individual would have been appointed but for the suspension of Senate confirmation of appointments.&#160;
