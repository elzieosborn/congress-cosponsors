    "text": "National Drone and Advanced Air Mobility Research and Development Act\n\nThis bill establishes programs and requirements to support domestic\u00a0research and development of unmanned aircraft systems (e.g., drones) and advanced air mobility (e.g., new aircraft models that\u00a0transport passengers, goods, and services more efficiently or to areas that are difficult to reach).\n\nFor example, the bill establishes an interagency working group to coordinate federal efforts and develop a strategic plan to support this technology. It also requires the Government Accountability Office to report on the procurement and use of foreign-made technology by the federal government.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) must establish a program to create institutes that support interdisciplinary research into this technology through public-private partnerships.\u00a0The National Institute of Standards and Technology\u00a0must also support these institutes and develop technical standards for this technology, such as security standards.\u00a0\n\nThe National Science Foundation must support Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education and training about this technology, such as though grants to educational institutions and nonprofits.\n\nThe bill also directs several agencies to research the potential of this technology and how it can be integrated into their programs and activities, including NASA, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe bill specifically prohibits using any funds that are authorized under this bill to purchase, acquire, or operate technology from North Korea, China, Russia, Iran, or any other foreign country of concern, other than to further research and development of U.S. technology.\n\n\u00a0"
