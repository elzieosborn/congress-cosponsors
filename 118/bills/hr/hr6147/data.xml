Within three years of this bill's enactment, the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture (USDA), as applicable, must

Congress must consider the recommendations of Interior and USDA when determining whether to make such a designation.

For each congressionally designated tribal cultural area, Interior or USDA must (1) establish a tribal commission to provide guidance and recommendations on the development of a management plan for the tribal cultural area, and (2) develop a comprehensive management plan.
