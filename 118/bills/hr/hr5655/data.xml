This bill allows a business-related tax credit for up to 50% of costs incurred for the purchase of personal locator beacons (PLBs) on a commercial vessel that has such beacons for every individual aboard the vessel. It also allows an income tax credit for individual taxpayers who purchase a PLB for use on a commercial vessel that does not have PLBs for every individual on board. The credits expire in taxable years beginning after 2028.</summary>
