This bill provides statutory authority for a research and development partnership between the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Specifically, the bill requires USDA and NSF to enter into a memorandum of understanding to support cross-cutting and collaborative research and development that furthers the missions of both agencies. Through the partnership, USDA and NSF may conduct research in a variety of focus areas (e.g., rural economic revitalization), promote multi-agency and cross-sector data sharing, support research infrastructure, and organize education and training initiatives.</summary>
