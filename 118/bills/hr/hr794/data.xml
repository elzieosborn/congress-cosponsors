This bill nullifies the rule titled Vaccine and Mask Requirements to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19 in Head Start Programs, which was issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on November 30, 2021. The rule requires that (1) all individuals two years of age and older wear face masks (subject to some exceptions) when participating in Head Start programs, and (2) Head Start staff and others with direct contact with children be vaccinated against COVID-19.

The bill also prohibits the issuance of any substantially similar rule.</summary>
