    "text": "Spectrum Relocation Enhancement Act\n\nThis bill modifies procedures related to the relocation or sharing of federal portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the uses of and requirements for the Spectrum Relocation Fund (SRF), which is a funding mechanism through which federal agencies can recover certain costs associated with spectrum relocation or sharing. The bill permits the SRF to more broadly cover those costs.\n\nCurrently, the SRF covers costs to achieve comparable capabilities, while the bill permits it to cover costs to deploy systems that satisfy operational requirements. Further, the SRF may cover costs for more extensive operational requirements than those being met before the relocation or sharing provided that the more extensive costs do not jeopardize an auction, sharing, or other nonfederal use of the spectrum.\n\nAdditionally, the bill expands planning and coordination requirements. This includes (1) specifying more detailed requirements for transition plans that federal agencies must submit to receive SRF payments, and (2) requiring agencies to coordinate with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on their transition plans and other activities.\n\nThe bill also funds administrative support for a technical panel that reviews the plans for transitioning federal use of spectrum to nonfederal or shared use."
