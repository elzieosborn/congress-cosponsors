The plan must incorporate certain elements, including estimates of improvements to coverage and accuracy and the potential use of\u00a0commercial radars.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also authorizes the National Weather Service to contract with third parties to fill gaps in radar coverage so as to better detect significant weather events over a larger area.\u00a0"
