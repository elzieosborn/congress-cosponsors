Specifically, GAO must evaluate the effects of (1) the post-incarceration ban on participation by\u00a0individuals convicted of a drug felony, and (2) state waiver provisions allowing for participation by these individuals.\u00a0(The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 bars convicted drug felons from participating in SNAP; however, a state may opt to serve such felons by waiving or modifying the requirement.)\n\nThe GAO must submit a report to Congress on the study and make the report publicly available on the agency's website."
