The Department of Agriculture may provide, without reimbursement, food programs to the people of the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe President must continue to provide special medical care and logistical support for the remaining members of the populations of Rongelap and Utrik who were exposed to radiation resulting from a 1954 U.S. thermonuclear test.\n\nThis section also addresses issues related to U.S. appointees to various committees established by the amended compacts, including the term lengths and qualifications of such appointees.\n\nThis section also reaffirms various provisions of agreements between the United States and the Marshall Islands and corresponding U.S. laws, including provisions concerning the settlement of claims for loss or damages from U.S. nuclear testing on the Marshall Islands.\n\n(Sec. 207) This section addresses issues related to U.S. consultations with Palau pursuant to the 2023 U.S.-Palau Compact Review Agreement, including by establishing qualifications for U.S. members of the Economic Advisory Group described in the agreement.\n\n(Sec. 208) This section addresses various issues related to the agreements, including providing agencies authorities to conduct oversight and monitoring activities.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall have the authorities necessary to carry out various oversight-related activities, such as audits of U.S.-provided assistance. The GAO must periodically report to Congress on various topics about each of the FAS, such as the (1) general social, political, and economic conditions; (2) use and effectiveness of U.S. assistance; and (3) status of economic policy reforms.\n\nThe section provides authorities to Interior and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to fulfill responsibilities for monitoring and managing funds related to the FAS.\n\nThe President must establish an Interagency Group on Freely Associated States to (1) coordinate the development and implementation of activities related to the FAS, and (2) provide recommendations and oversight to federal agencies with respect to the agreements.\n\nThis section also reaffirms that the foreign loans or debt of the governments of the FAS do not constitute an obligation of the United States, and that the full faith and credit of the U.S. government shall not apply to such loans or debt without specific further authorization.\n\n(Sec. 209) This section addresses U.S. activities in the FAS, including medical care for veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces and grants related to education.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may furnish hospital care and medical services in the FAS to a veteran who is otherwise eligible to receive such care and services. Such care and services may be provided for any condition even if the condition is not connected to the veteran's service. Before providing the care and services, the VA must enter into agreements with the governments of the FAS regarding various issues, including the licensure and certification of the health care personnel providing the care and services.\n\nThe VA may also pay the travel expenses of an individual to travel to, from, or within the FAS to receive such hospital care and medical services.\n\nThe VA may also continue to provide medical care and travel benefits to a veteran who received such care and services regardless of whether the country continues to qualify as an FAS.\n\nSubject to the availability of appropriations, the VA must conduct outreach to and engage with each government of the FAS and increase staffing as necessary to conduct such outreach.\n\nThis section also requires the U.S. government to continue to make available to the FAS certain education-related grants and assistance, including grants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to the extent such grants continue to be available in the United States. For certain grant programs that are currently available to one or some of the FAS, such as certain assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (currently available to Palau), the United States must continue to offer such assistance and make such assistance available in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.\n\nOther than the grants specifically named in this section, the Department of Education may not provide a grant under any formula grant program to the FAS.\n\nThis section also extends the Head Start program to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. (The Head Start program provides comprehensive early childhood education and development services for low-income children. Currently, the program operates in the 50 states, five territories, and Palau.)\n\nThe Department of Defense must make its medical facilities in the FAS available for use by the citizens of the FAS if the individual has received a referral from the relevant government.\n\nInterior must provide training for judges and judiciary officials in the FAS.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must make National Health Service Corps services available to the residents of the FAS to the same extent and for the same duration as the services are authorized for individuals residing in any other areas within or outside the United States.\n\nPalau shall be eligible for certain programs currently available to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, such as programs provided by the Small Business Administration and the Economic Development Administration. Palau shall also be eligible for services provided by the Legal Services Corporation, the Public Health Service, and the Rural Housing Service.\n\nThis section also relaxes requirements related to federal public benefits for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States. For example, many non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) are generally not eligible for federal means-tested benefits for five years starting from when the individual entered the United States. Current law provides an exception for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States to receive Medicaid without this five-year waiting period. This section expands this exception to allow FAS citizens to receive other federal means-tested public benefits without the waiting period.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must consult with the Asian Development Bank and relevant international financial institutions concerning assistance to the FAS.\n\nThe Department of State must establish a unit with the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs to address issues relating to the FAS, including managing relationships with the FAS.\n\n(Sec. 210) This section establishes that appropriations for certain activities required by the Compacts of Free Association shall be made directly to the federal agencies carrying out the activities. The section also establishes that certain assistance provided under the agreements shall be in addition to other amounts to be paid to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.\n\n(Sec. 211) This section provides funding for FY2024-FY2043 for various activities related to the FAS. Specifically, the section provides appropriations for (1) Interior to carry out specified requirements related to the agreements with the FAS, (2) the USPS to carry out specified requirements related to the agreements with the FAS, and (3) Interior for judicial training as required under Section 209 of this title.\n\nTITLE III--EXTENSIONS AND OTHER MATTERS\n\n(Sec. 301) This section extends through March 8, 2031, restrictions on firearms that are undetectable by walk-through metal detectors and X-ray machines commonly used at airports.\n\nUnited States Parole Commission Additional Extension Act of 2024\n\n(Sec. 302) This section extends the U.S. Parole Commission.\n\n(Sec. 303) This section extends the sequestration that applies to Medicare payments in FY2032.\n\nTITLE IV--BUDGETARY EFFECTS\n\n(Sec. 401) This section exempts the budgetary effects of this division from (1) the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO Act), (2) the Senate PAYGO rule, and (3) certain budget scorekeeping rules."
