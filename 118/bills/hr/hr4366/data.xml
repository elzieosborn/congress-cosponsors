TITLE II--AMENDING COMPACTS OF FREE ASSOCIATION

Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2024

This title provides congressional approval for amendments to the Compacts of Free Association. The compacts are the agreements that govern the relationship of the United States with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau, collectively referred to as the Freely Associated States (FAS). The title also addresses other issues related to the FAS, including by authorizing various U.S. assistance to the FAS.

(Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau are sovereign states that, through the Compacts of Free Association, receive U.S. economic assistance and allow the United States to operate military bases in their territory. Citizens of the FAS have the right to work and reside in the United States and may serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.)

The President may bring into force and implement the agreements that have received congressional approval or consent in this section.

This section also imposes limits and requirements related to actions by the U.S. government to amend, change, or terminate agreements with the FAS. For example, any amendment or termination of the amended Compacts of Free Association may not enter into force until Congress has incorporated the change in an act. Any changes to subsidiary agreements may not enter into force until 90 days after the President has reported certain information to Congress.

(Sec. 205) This section addresses issues relating to provisions in the amended U.S.-FSM Compact, the agreement between the United States and Micronesia.

The U.S. government must provide nonreimbursable technical and training assistance, as appropriate, to enable the government of Micronesia to (1) develop and adequately enforce its own laws, and (2) cooperate with U.S. efforts to enforce U.S. laws.

This section also addresses issues related to U.S. appointees to various committees established by the amended agreement, including the term lengths and qualifications of such appointees.

(Sec. 206) This section addresses issues related to provisions in the amended U.S.-RMI Compact, the agreement between the United States and the Marshall Islands.

The U.S. government must provide nonreimbursable technical and training assistance, as appropriate, to enable the government of the Marshall Islands to (1) develop and adequately enforce its own laws, and (2) cooperate with U.S. efforts to enforce U.S. laws.

(Sec. 208) This section addresses various issues related to the agreements, including providing agencies authorities to conduct oversight and monitoring activities.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall have the authorities necessary to carry out various oversight-related activities, such as audits of U.S.-provided assistance. The GAO must periodically report to Congress on various topics about each of the FAS, such as the (1) general social, political, and economic conditions; (2) use and effectiveness of U.S. assistance; and (3) status of economic policy reforms.

The section provides authorities to Interior and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to fulfill responsibilities for monitoring and managing funds related to the FAS.

The President must establish an Interagency Group on Freely Associated States to (1) coordinate the development and implementation of activities related to the FAS, and (2) provide recommendations and oversight to federal agencies with respect to the agreements.

(Sec. 209) This section addresses U.S. activities in the FAS, including medical care for veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces and grants related to education.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may furnish hospital care and medical services in the FAS to a veteran who is otherwise eligible to receive such care and services. Such care and services may be provided for any condition even if the condition is not connected to the veteran's service. Before providing the care and services, the VA must enter into agreements with the governments of the FAS regarding various issues, including the licensure and certification of the health care personnel providing the care and services.

The VA may also pay the travel expenses of an individual to travel to, from, or within the FAS to receive such hospital care and medical services.

Subject to the availability of appropriations, the VA must conduct outreach to and engage with each government of the FAS and increase staffing as necessary to conduct such outreach.

This section also requires the U.S. government to continue to make available to the FAS certain education-related grants and assistance, including grants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to the extent such grants continue to be available in the United States. For certain grant programs that are currently available to one or some of the FAS, such as certain assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (currently available to Palau), the United States must continue to offer such assistance and make such assistance available in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Other than the grants specifically named in this section, the Department of Education may not provide a grant under any formula grant program to the FAS.

This section also extends the Head Start program to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. (The Head Start program provides comprehensive early childhood education and development services for low-income children. Currently, the program operates in the 50 states, five territories, and Palau.)

The Department of Defense must make its medical facilities in the FAS available for use by the citizens of the FAS if the individual has received a referral from the relevant government.

Interior must provide training for judges and judiciary officials in the FAS.

Palau shall also be eligible for services provided by the Legal Services Corporation, the Public Health Service, and the Rural Housing Service.

This section also relaxes requirements related to federal public benefits for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States. For example, many non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) are generally not eligible for federal means-tested benefits for five years starting from when the individual entered the United States. Current law provides an exception for FAS citizens who lawfully reside in the United States to receive Medicaid without this five-year waiting period. This section expands this exception to allow FAS citizens to receive other federal means-tested public benefits without the waiting period.

The Department of the Treasury must consult with the Asian Development Bank and relevant international financial institutions concerning assistance to the FAS.

The Department of State must establish a unit with the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs to address issues relating to the FAS, including managing relationships with the FAS.

The section also establishes that certain assistance provided under the agreements shall be in addition to other amounts to be paid to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.
