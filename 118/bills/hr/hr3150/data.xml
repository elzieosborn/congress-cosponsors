This bill establishes and revises certain grants and resources to address opioid-related overdoses.

Specifically, the bill authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to states, territories, and localities to improve data and surveillance related to opioid overdoses.

Additionally, the bill directs DOJ to award grants to law enforcement agencies and forensic laboratories in communities with high rates of drug overdoses to (1) provide training to help officers better identify overdoses, (2) upgrade essential systems for drug tracing and processing samples in forensic laboratories, or (3) provide training to better trace criminals through the dark web.

The bill requires the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to provide training to state and local law enforcement agencies on how to best coordinate with state and federal partners for tracking drug-related activity.

The bill allows funds under the Community Oriented Policing Services grant program to be used to provide training and resources for equipment that protects first responders from secondary fentanyl exposure.

Finally, the bill directs the Drug Enforcement Administration to (1) develop uniform reporting standards for information concerning drug control activities, and (2) budget for a program that analyzes fentanyl samples.</summary>
