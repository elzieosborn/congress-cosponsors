The bill also reauthorizes the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nUSCIS shall establish a nonprofit entity to spur innovation in expanding citizenship preparation programs and to support assistance for immigrants seeking lawful permanent resident status or citizenship.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of Homeland Security to (1) report to Congress before increasing fees for immigration adjudication and naturalization services above the levels of such fees on January 1, 2019, and (2) waive or reduce certain immigration-related fees for low-income individuals.\n\nThe bill also (1) waives the English proficiency requirement for the naturalization of certain lawful permanent residents, (2) repeals the public charge ground for deportation, (3) requires states to provide for automatic voter registration to qualifying new citizens unless that individual declines, and (4) sets a floor of 125,000 to the maximum number of refugees who may be admitted into the United States each year."
