  <summary date="2023-09-11T11:20:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act

This bill permanently adds fentanyl-related substances to schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. (A schedule I controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that has a high potential for abuse; has no currently accepted medical value; and is subject to regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act.)

Fentanyl-related substances are currently regulated under schedule I through a temporary order issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The temporary order expires December 31, 2024.</summary>
