    "text": "Federal Broadband Permit Coordination Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior to coordinate with specified federal entities and other stakeholders to expedite permits for broadband projects (i.e., projects to install fiber optic lines, communications towers, and related infrastructure). It also allows the departments to establish teams to support the coordination efforts.\n\nSpecifically, USDA and Interior must enter into agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to coordinate and expedite the permits. In developing the agreements, USDA and Interior (1) must consult with organizations representing state and tribal historic preservation officers, and (2) may request that states and Indian tribes with broadband projects in their jurisdictions enter the agreements.\n\nAfter entering an agreement, USDA and Interior may designate employees with expertise in planning, environmental analyses, and other relevant topics to work as part of a team in a state or regional office that has been delegated responsibility for issuing broadband permits."
