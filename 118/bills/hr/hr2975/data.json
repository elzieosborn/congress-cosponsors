    "text": "Eliminating Needless Administrative Barriers Lessening Efficiency for Conservation Act of 2023 or the ENABLE Conservation Act of 2023 \n\nThis bill amends the continuous enrollment procedure for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) of the Farm Service Agency. CRP is a land conservation program that provides an annual rental payment to farmers in exchange for removing environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and planting species that will improve environmental health and quality.\n\nSpecifically, the bill permanently allows producers to use the continuous enrollment procedure for land that will be enrolled under the State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) initiative.\u00a0(The SAFE initiative restores habitats to meet high-priority state wildlife conservation goals.)\u00a0\n\nThe bill also allows the Department of Agriculture to grant a waiver to exclude acreage enrolled under the continuous enrollment procedure from a cap that limits the amount of cropland in a county that is permitted to be enrolled in CRP. The government of the county involved must concur with the waiver for it to be granted. \u00a0"
