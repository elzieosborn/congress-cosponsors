The office also must establish a unified coordination group to oversee the interagency response to supply chain shocks and the office must designate critical industries, critical supply chains, and critical goods.\n\nAdditionally, the office must facilitate the development of guidelines and best practices to reduce the risk of critical supply chain disruption.\n\nThe bill includes various program evaluation and reporting requirements."
