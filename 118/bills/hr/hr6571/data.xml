This bill requires the Industry and Analysis office of the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce to monitor and respond to disruptions in critical industries and supply chains.

Specifically, the office must establish a critical supply chain resiliency program to (1) map, monitor, and model critical supply chains; (2) identify high-priority supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities in critical industries; (3) identify and evaluate the effect of potential supply chain disruptions on U.S. economic security; and (4) collaborate with other governmental bodies and key international partners to identify opportunities to reduce supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities. The office also must establish a unified coordination group to oversee the interagency response to supply chain shocks and the office must designate critical industries, critical supply chains, and critical goods.

Additionally, the office must facilitate the development of guidelines and best practices to reduce the risk of critical supply chain disruption.

The bill includes various program evaluation and reporting requirements.</summary>
