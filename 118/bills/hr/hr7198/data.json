A small entity or group of small entities may petition the Office of Advocacy to review such certification. The petition must include specified information, such as the issues the petitioner believes should be addressed and a proposed solution to the issues raised.\n\nIf the Office of Advocacy ultimately determines, upon a full review of the petition, that the proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a\u00a0substantial number of small entities, the agency promulgating the rule must perform an initial\u00a0and final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule. Additionally, if the agency does not participate or assist in the full review process, the finalized rule shall not apply to small entities.\n\nThe bill also requires agencies to publish, and allow for comments on, all guidance documents with respect to any rule an agency determines is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."
