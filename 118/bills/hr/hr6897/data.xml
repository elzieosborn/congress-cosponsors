This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a pilot program to support domestic manufacturing of critical pharmaceutical ingredients and their components through certain novel technology.

Specifically, DOD must establish a three-year program that uses technology involving synthetic biology to support domestic manufacturing of pharmaceutical ingredients and related incorporated materials that (1) are not available in a sufficient quantity or quality domestically, and (2) are strategically important to the United States.
