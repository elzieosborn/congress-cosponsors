This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to establish separate special accounts for the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Forest Service for the deposit of rental fees received by such agencies under communications use authorizations, which allow for the occupancy and use of federal lands for communications purposes.

The rental fees received by each agency must

 be deposited in the agency's special account, and remain available for expenditure for agency activities related to communications sites (those areas of federal lands designated for telecommunications uses). The Departments of the Interior and Agriculture may enter into cooperative agreements to carry out activities related to communications sites.</summary>
