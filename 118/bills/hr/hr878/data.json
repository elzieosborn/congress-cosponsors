    "text": "This bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to appoint an Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety Technology and establish a rulemaking committee on aviation safety technologies. Under the bill, aviation safety technology is airborne or ground-based equipment that is meant to reduce the occurrence of aviation accidents (e.g., auto take-off, navigation, and taxi technology; navigation technology; and remote piloting technology).\n\nSpecifically, the new associate administrator's responsibilities include coordinating, developing, and implementing a variety of processes and measures for FAA certification and operational approval of aviation safety technologies.\n\nFurther, the aviation rulemaking committee must make recommendations for the development of\u00a0a detailed roadmap for the certification and operational approval of aviation safety technologies by the FAA, with a focus on technologies, software, and automation to enhance operational safety. The committee must also issue a notice of proposed rulemaking based on any consensus recommendations."
