  <summary date="2024-03-19T21:35:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Cosmetic Safety for Communities of Color and Professional Salon Workers Act of 2023

This bill establishes several programs and requirements to address harmful chemicals in cosmetics and their effects on customers and salon workers, particularly in communities of color.

For example, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to nonprofits and educational institutions to research harmful chemicals in cosmetics that are primarily marketed to and used by women and girls of color. HHS must publish a report summarizing the research, including recommendations for reducing exposure to such harmful cosmetics. HHS must similarly award grants for research, and publish a related report, about harmful chemicals in products that are used by professional nail, hair, and beauty salon workers.

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration must award grants to support the development of alternative, safer chemicals that may be used in place of harmful chemicals in cosmetics.

HHS must also establish a National Resource Center on Beauty Justice and a National Resource Center on Salon Worker Health and Safety to educate customers and salon workers, respectively, about harmful chemicals in cosmetics, with a particular focus on communities of color.

The Department of Labor must require manufacturers of professional cosmetics to prepare and publish product safety sheets that identify harmful chemicals in their products. Salon owners and operators must also provide product safety sheets to their employees.</summary>
