PDP sponsors must similarly report pharmacies that the sponsor or a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) owns or in which the sponsor or PBM has a controlling interest.\u00a0\n\nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must report on the status of vertical integration between Medicare health care providers, pharmacies, PDP sponsors, MA organizations, and PBMs."
