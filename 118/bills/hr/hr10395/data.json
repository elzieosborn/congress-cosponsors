Covered veterans are veterans who died on or before November 1, 1990, and were released or discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable. Currently, these benefits are only available to eligible veterans who died on or after November 1, 1990.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to update the National Cemetery Administration website with respect to the requirements for eligibility for a headstone or burial marker.\u00a0"
