This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to take certain actions related to mobile devices in elementary and secondary schools.

First, the bill directs ED, in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services, to study and report on the use of mobile devices in elementary and secondary schools nationwide. Among other elements, this study must include the impact of mobile device use on student learning and academic achievement, student educational outcomes, and student mental health.

Second, ED must establish a pilot program to award grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to enable participating schools served by such LEAs to purchase secure containers and install lockers in order to create a school environment free of mobile devices.</summary>
