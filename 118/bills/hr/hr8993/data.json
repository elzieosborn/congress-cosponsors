Among other elements, this study must include the impact of mobile device use on student learning and academic achievement, student educational outcomes, and student mental health.\n\nSecond, ED must establish a pilot program to award grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to enable participating schools served by such LEAs to purchase secure containers and install lockers in order to create a school environment free of mobile devices."
