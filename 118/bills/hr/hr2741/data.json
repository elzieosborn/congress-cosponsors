    "text": "Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2023\n\nThis bill addresses\u00a0Coast Guard operations,\u00a0maritime security, and related matters.\n\nThe bill\u00a0authorizes\u00a0for FY2024 and FY2025 the Coast Guard's\u00a0active-duty personnel and military training student levels and activities related to\u00a0information technology, environmental compliance, and other purposes.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Coast Guard\u00a0to\u00a0suspend a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's credential if it has probable cause to believe that an individual poses a threat to others on a vessel. Further, the bill extends existing vessel registry requirements\u00a0prohibiting foreign ownership\u00a0to vessels supporting alternate energy production or transmission or\u00a0commercial space exploration activities over the Outer Continental Shelf.\n\nAmong other provisions, the bill\u00a0also\n\nrequires the Coast Guard to provide ballast water quality data to any state or territory upon request;establishes the felony crime of grossly negligent operation of a vessel when conduct results in serious bodily injury;authorizes the President to direct or control foreign-flag vessels when a cyber incident, transnational organized crime, or foreign state threats endanger U.S. security; andauthorizes the Coast Guard to respond to cyber incidents, transnational organized crime, or foreign state threats\u00a0to prevent damage to structures located on and near\u00a0navigable waters.The bill also\u00a0modifies the minimum requirements for various merchant mariner credentials, including by reducing certain service time prerequisites\u00a0and extending eligibility to noncitizen nationals of the United States. (Generally, individuals who receive U.S. nationality by virtue of being born in, or having parents who were born in,\u00a0the U.S. outlying possessions are U.S. nationals but not U.S.\u00a0citizens.)"
