  <summary date="2024-11-20T17:30:59Z" status="Introduced in House">Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2023

This bill addresses&#160;Coast Guard operations,&#160;maritime security, and related matters.

The bill&#160;authorizes&#160;for FY2024 and FY2025 the Coast Guard's&#160;active-duty personnel and military training student levels and activities related to&#160;information technology, environmental compliance, and other purposes.

The bill authorizes the Coast Guard&#160;to&#160;suspend a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's credential if it has probable cause to believe that an individual poses a threat to others on a vessel. Further, the bill extends existing vessel registry requirements&#160;prohibiting foreign ownership&#160;to vessels supporting alternate energy production or transmission or&#160;commercial space exploration activities over the Outer Continental Shelf.

Among other provisions, the bill&#160;also

requires the Coast Guard to provide ballast water quality data to any state or territory upon request;establishes the felony crime of grossly negligent operation of a vessel when conduct results in serious bodily injury;authorizes the President to direct or control foreign-flag vessels when a cyber incident, transnational organized crime, or foreign state threats endanger U.S. security; andauthorizes the Coast Guard to respond to cyber incidents, transnational organized crime, or foreign state threats&#160;to prevent damage to structures located on and near&#160;navigable waters.The bill also&#160;modifies the minimum requirements for various merchant mariner credentials, including by reducing certain service time prerequisites&#160;and extending eligibility to noncitizen nationals of the United States. (Generally, individuals who receive U.S. nationality by virtue of being born in, or having parents who were born in,&#160;the U.S. outlying possessions are U.S. nationals but not U.S.&#160;citizens.)</summary>
