    "text": "Climate Change Relief for Urban Areas Act of 2023\n\nThis bill revises support for urban and community forestry and establishes a program to support rooftop gardens for public elementary and secondary schools.\n\nFirst, the bill revises provisions under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 that provide assistance for urban and community forestry. Assistance must be prioritized for areas with low tree equity scores which indicate whether there are enough trees in a neighborhood and are based on how the tree canopy and surface temperature of an area align with income, employment, race, age, and health factors of that area.\n\nSecond, the bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a program that awards grants for rooftop gardens on public elementary and secondary schools. In awarding grants, USDA must prioritize schools in areas with the lowest garden equity scores. The scores must be based on the population density, racial composition, incidence of respiratory illness, number of urban gardens, food sovereignty, and average surface temperature of the areas."
