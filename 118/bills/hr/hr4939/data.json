    "text": "This bill allows livestock producers and their employees to take certain actions against crested caracaras to protect livestock. (Crested caracaras\u00a0are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.)\n\nSpecifically, livestock producers and their employees may (1) take (i.e., capture, kill, disperse, or transport) a crested caracara that they reasonably believe will cause death, injury, or destruction to livestock; or (2) in the course of taking or attempting to take the crested caracara, cause injury to the bird.\n\nLivestock producers and their employees must submit an annual report to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) on crested caracaras taken under this bill. The FWS must make this reporting form available on its website.\n\nCurrently, the FWS has a special permit process under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for the taking of\u00a0crested caracaras.\u00a0"
