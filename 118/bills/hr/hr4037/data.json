Currently, air carriers must submit the plan only to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). (These plans must include certain protocols for reporting verbal or physical assaults and for the notification of law enforcement.)\n\nThe FAA, in consultation with the TSA, must submit a report to Congress on all of the Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plans submitted by commercial air carriers. The plans must be listed by each air carrier.\n\nThe bill also specifies that current protections against interference with federal, airport, or air carrier employees who have airport security duties include employees performing ticketing, check-in or baggage claim, or boarding functions.\u00a0"
