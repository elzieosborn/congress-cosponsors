  <summary date="2024-07-09T17:20:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Airline Employee Assault Prevention Act 

This bill modifies the requirements for the Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plans that must be submitted by air carriers.

Specifically, the bill requires that, within 90 days of enactment, commercial air carriers submit an Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plan to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for review and acceptance. Currently, air carriers must submit the plan only to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). (These plans must include certain protocols for reporting verbal or physical assaults and for the notification of law enforcement.)

The FAA, in consultation with the TSA, must submit a report to Congress on all of the Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plans submitted by commercial air carriers. The plans must be listed by each air carrier.

The bill also specifies that current protections against interference with federal, airport, or air carrier employees who have airport security duties include employees performing ticketing, check-in or baggage claim, or boarding functions.&#160;</summary>
