    "text": "Cable Access for Broadband and Local Economic Leadership Act or the CABLE Leadership Act\n\nThis bill requires a state or local entity that regulates certain aspects of cable operators (franchising authorities) to make decisions about whether to grant or deny a complete request for a new cable franchise within a specified time frame. The bill also outlines what constitutes a complete request.\n\nIf a franchising authority fails to respond within the time frame, the request is deemed automatically granted. Additionally, a denial of a request must be in writing, supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record, and publicly released (and provided to the party who made the request) on the same day the decision is made."
