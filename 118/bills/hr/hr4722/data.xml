This bill makes certain military spouses who are non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) eligible for lawful permanent resident status (also known as a green card).

To be eligible for a green card under this bill, an individual must be the current or former spouse of a U.S. citizen who serves or served in the Armed Forces, either on active duty or in a reserve component. If the U.S. citizen has been discharged from the Armed Forces, such discharge must be under honorable conditions.

Certain factors that would otherwise make an individual inadmissible, such as having entered the United States without being admitted, shall not apply to a spouse seeking a green card under the bill. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may also waive certain factors that would otherwise make an individual inadmissible, such as having misrepresented a material fact to secure a visa, if the individual does not pose a threat to the public and has not committed any crimes that are unrelated to immigration status.

The bill also requires DHS and the Department of State to allow a qualifying non-U.S. national spouse to (1) apply for an immigrant visa to enter the United States under this bill; and (2) enter and stay in the United States to reunite with their U.S. citizen spouse while the application is pending, if the non-U.S. national spouse does not pose a threat to the public or national security.</summary>
