This bill allows a money market fund, under specified conditions, to elect to operate using a different method of valuation than is otherwise required. A money market fund that elects to do so shall not be subject to requirements related to the imposition of liquidity fees. (A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in liquid, short-term assets.)

The Securities and Exchange Commission and securities exchanges are prohibited from enforcing rules or issuing guidance that imposes specified pricing structures or fees on an open-end company. (An open-end company offers securities in pooled investment vehicles such as mutual funds.)</summary>
