This bill expands eligibility for certain special compensation to disabled uniformed services retirees who are survivors of military sexual trauma.

Specifically, the bill renames combat-related special compensation as trauma-related special compensation and makes eligible for such compensation trauma-related disabled uniformed services retirees (i.e., members of the uniformed services who have a trauma-related disability and are entitled to retired pay).

The bill expands the former definition of a combat-related disability (now a trauma-related disability under this bill) to include a disability that is compensable under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and is determined by the VA to be the result of military sexual trauma.</summary>
