This bill requires the federal crop insurance program (FCIP) to provide for the research and development of a policy to insure table, wine, and juice grapes against losses due to a freeze event. (The term policy means an insurance policy, plan of insurance, provision of a policy or plan of insurance, and related materials.) The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, the agency that finances FCIP operations, must make any resulting policy available that meets specified FCIP requirements.

The FCIP must also submit a report to Congress on the research and any resulting policy.</summary>
