In addition, foreign nationals may not make donations or make promises to make donations to inaugural committees.\n\nFurther, the bill caps the amount an individual may donate to an inaugural committee.\n\nDonations to inaugural committees may not be converted to personal use.\n\nFinally, inaugural committees must report certain information on donations and disbursements to the Federal Election Commission."
