This bill revises the federal statutory framework that confers appellate jurisdiction to courts.

Among the changes, the bill grants the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit&#8212;not the Supreme Court&#8212;jurisdiction over

 direct appeals from final decisions of three-judge panels, and appeals by certiorari and certified questions. The bill also establishes a 13-judge multi-circuit panel and grants it jurisdiction over any case in which the United States or a federal agency is a party, or a case concerning constitutional interpretation, statutory interpretation of federal law, or the function or actions of an executive order.

Finally, the bill specifies that whenever an action before a federal court seeks injunctive relief barring the enforcement of a federal law, statute, regulation, or order against a nonparty, the court shall, upon a motion of a party, transfer the action to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.</summary>
