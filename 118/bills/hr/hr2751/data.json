    "text": "Community Solar Consumer Choice Act of 2023\n\nThis bill sets forth provisions that support access to community solar energy and increases the allowable time period for a long-term contract between the General Services Administration (GSA) and a public utility.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a program to increase access to community solar energy programs for individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, states, local governments, and tribal governments. In addition, DOE must, to the extent practicable, expand existing grant, loan, and financing programs to include community solar programs.\n\nFurther, the bill modifies requirements under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 for electric utilities, including by requiring each electric utility to offer a community solar program that provides all ratepayers, including low-income ratepayers, equitable and demonstrable access to such program.\n\nFinally, the bill allows the GSA to make a public utility contract for a period of up to 30 years. Currently, the GSA may make a public utility contract for up to 10 years."
