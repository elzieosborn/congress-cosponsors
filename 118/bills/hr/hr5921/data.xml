  <summary date="2024-01-18T14:22:53Z" status="Reported to House">No U.S. Financing for Iran Act of 2023

This bill prohibits certain actions related to exports, imports, and financing with respect to Iran.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the Department of the Treasury from authorizing U.S. financial institution transactions in connection with the importation from or exportation to Iran of goods, services, or technology. This prohibition does not apply to the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, medical devices, or humanitarian assistance benefitting the civilian population of Iran.

The bill requires Treasury to instruct U.S. representatives to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to (1) oppose IMF financial assistance, and the allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR), to Iran; and (2) seek to ensure that IMF member countries prohibit the exchange of SDR held by Iran. (The SDR is an international reserve asset maintained by the IMF based on contributions from IMF member countries. SDRs may be exchanged between member countries and may also be exchanged for currencies.)

Further, the bill provides statutory authority for the prohibition on Export-Import Bank financing with respect to Iran.

The bill's provisions shall be in effect until the earlier of (1) 30 days after the President certifies to Congress that Iran has ceased providing support for acts of international terrorism and is not a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, or (2) 10 years after this bill's enactment.</summary>
