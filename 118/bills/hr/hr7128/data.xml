This bill modifies the authority of federal agencies to limit competition for certain government contracts to women-owned small businesses under certain circumstances. The bill specifies that certification as such a small business includes compliance with the applicable size standards under current law.

A women-owned small business that is certified as of enactment of this bill may continue to qualify for such contracts until the business notifies the Small Business Administration (SBA) that it is no longer such a small business or the SBA determines the business exceeds the applicable size standards.</summary>
