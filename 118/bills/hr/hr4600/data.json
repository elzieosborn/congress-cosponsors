Currently, these professionals must act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interests of the professional providing the advice. The bill adds that the best interest standard must be based on pecuniary factors (i.e., a factor that a fiduciary determines will have a material effect on an investment's performance) unless the customer otherwise directs.\n\nIn addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission must report on (1) municipal bond disclosures regarding climate change and environmental matters, and (2) the effectiveness of specified rules in preventing the payment of government officials or candidates in exchange for government business in connection with the sale or offer of municipal securities."
