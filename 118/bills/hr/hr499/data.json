In particular, an issuer with specified connections to China must annually disclose a variety of details, including\n\n whether executive-level employees, senior directors, or board members are members of the Communist Party of China; interactions with the party; expenditures in China; expenditures in the United States regarding operations and lobbying activities; and the ability of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to audit the issuer. Additionally, an exchange-traded fund that invests in a Chinese company must annually disclose about that company\n\n ownership information, party involvement, whether the company participates in specified Chinese policies or activities, any ties to U.S.-sanctioned individuals, and the types of products or services produced by the company."
