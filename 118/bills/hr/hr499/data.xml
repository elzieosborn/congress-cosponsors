This bill requires certain issuers of securities and funds traded on an exchange to report on connections to China or the Communist Party of China. In particular, an issuer with specified connections to China must annually disclose a variety of details, including

 whether executive-level employees, senior directors, or board members are members of the Communist Party of China; interactions with the party; expenditures in China; expenditures in the United States regarding operations and lobbying activities; and the ability of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to audit the issuer. Additionally, an exchange-traded fund that invests in a Chinese company must annually disclose about that company

 ownership information, party involvement, whether the company participates in specified Chinese policies or activities, any ties to U.S.-sanctioned individuals, and the types of products or services produced by the company.</summary>
