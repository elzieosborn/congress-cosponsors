This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to report on the role location obfuscation technology (IP address manipulation that includes the use of virtual private networks [VPNs] and proxy servers) plays in U.S. sanctions evasions, money laundering, and other illicit finance activity. Treasury must also assess the degree to which a financial technology platform relies upon a user&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s IP address to indicate a user&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s location and a platform&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s ability to use aggregated location data to indicate a user&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s location in the event one or more data points have been manipulated. The report must also contain an analysis of techniques to reduce evasion of U.S. sanctions and money laundering laws and regulations.</summary>
