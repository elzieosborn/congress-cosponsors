Treasury must also assess the degree to which a financial technology platform relies upon a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IP address to indicate a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location and a platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to use aggregated location data to indicate a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location in the event one or more data points have been manipulated. The report must also contain an analysis of techniques to reduce evasion of U.S. sanctions and money laundering laws and regulations."
