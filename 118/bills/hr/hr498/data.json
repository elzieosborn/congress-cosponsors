(The lifeline is a three-digit number that connects callers in suicidal crisis or mental health distress to a national network of crisis centers.)\n\nThe bill also expands related reporting requirements. Specifically, the network administrator for the lifeline must report identified cybersecurity incidents and vulnerabilities to SAMHSA, and local and regional crisis centers that participate in the lifeline must report identified cybersecurity incidents and vulnerabilities to the administrator.\n\nAdditionally, the Government Accountability Office must conduct a study that evaluates cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities associated with the lifeline and report the findings to Congress."
