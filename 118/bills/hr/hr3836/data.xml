This bill specifies that state Medicaid programs are authorized to provide primary care services through direct primary care arrangements (i.e., arrangements in which primary care providers receive a fixed periodic fee for their services).

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must (1) convene at least one virtual stakeholder meeting and issue related guidance on how state Medicaid programs may implement direct primary care arrangements, and (2) report on the extent to which state Medicaid programs contract with independent providers and on the quality and cost of care under direct primary care arrangements that are offered through Medicaid managed care organizations.</summary>
