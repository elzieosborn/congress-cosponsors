    "text": "Improving Data Accessibility Through Advancements in Public Health Act or the Improving DATA in Public Health Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to require entities such as health care providers and local health departments to report public health data to the CDC. The bill also establishes grants to support collecting and reporting public health data\u00a0and establishes the Public Health Information Sharing and Availability Advisory Committee.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must award grants and other assistance to state, tribal, and local governments; health care providers; and other eligible entities to develop and disseminate best practices for collecting electronic health information and using data and technology standards for public health data systems.\n\nThe bill also expands requirements related to those standards, including by requiring them to capture demographic characteristics and other information (e.g., veteran status and housing status).\n\nAdditionally, the CDC must collaborate with state, local, and tribal health authorities to ensure that collected data is accessible to such authorities in a timely manner. Further, if data or information is reportable under state or local law, the state or local jurisdiction must receive the data or information before or at the same time as the CDC.\n\nFurther, the CDC may modify reporting requirements during declared emergencies without going through typical rulemaking procedures.\n\nThe bill expressly restricts, subject to exceptions, certain disclosures of data and information reported to the CDC, including for purposes of litigation."
