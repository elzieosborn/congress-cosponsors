This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement a program to use anonymized data (i.e., data that has had all personal identifiers removed) that is derived from third-party entities to improve transportation management capabilities and efficiency on federal-aid highways.

Specifically, DOT must&#160;enable the use of&#160;anonymized data to (1) inform certain infrastructure planning decisions (e.g., decisions related to&#160;increasing safety, improving freight efficiency, and enhancing environmental conditions), and (2) facilitate&#160;integrated traffic management systems that leverage real-time data to provide dynamic and efficient traffic flow management for purposes such as&#160;adjusting traffic light cycle times and responding to severe weather events.

The bill authorizes DOT to enter into agreements with public and private sector entities to implement the program and requires DOT to consult with at least one organization that supports the development of intelligent transportation systems.

Further, DOT must issue guidance on (1) the protection of privacy for all consumers and&#160;sources of data used in the program; and (2) the accuracy of the data used in the program, including preventing hacking and spoofing.&#160;

 Within three years of enactment&#160;of this bill, DOT must make available best practices on how to leverage private consumer data to support improved transportation management capabilities and efficiency.

Finally, the bill specifies that&#160;DOT may take such actions as necessary&#160;to maximize the effective implementation of this bill, including&#160;consolidating these requirements within other DOT activities.&#160;</summary>
