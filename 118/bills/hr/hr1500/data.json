    "text": "Intelligent Transportation Integration Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement a program to use anonymized data (i.e., data that has had all personal identifiers removed) that is derived from third-party entities to improve transportation management capabilities and efficiency on federal-aid highways.\n\nSpecifically, DOT must\u00a0enable the use of\u00a0anonymized data to (1) inform certain infrastructure planning decisions (e.g., decisions related to\u00a0increasing safety, improving freight efficiency, and enhancing environmental conditions), and (2) facilitate\u00a0integrated traffic management systems that leverage real-time data to provide dynamic and efficient traffic flow management for purposes such as\u00a0adjusting traffic light cycle times and responding to severe weather events.\n\nThe bill authorizes DOT to enter into agreements with public and private sector entities to implement the program and requires DOT to consult with at least one organization that supports the development of intelligent transportation systems.\n\nFurther, DOT must issue guidance on (1) the protection of privacy for all consumers and\u00a0sources of data used in the program; and (2) the accuracy of the data used in the program, including preventing hacking and spoofing.\u00a0\n\n Within three years of enactment\u00a0of this bill, DOT must make available best practices on how to leverage private consumer data to support improved transportation management capabilities and efficiency.\n\nFinally, the bill specifies that\u00a0DOT may take such actions as necessary\u00a0to maximize the effective implementation of this bill, including\u00a0consolidating these requirements within other DOT activities.\u00a0"
