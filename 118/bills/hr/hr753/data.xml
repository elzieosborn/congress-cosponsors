This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to install and operate an on-site regulated medical waste treatment system at each VA facility that would benefit from such a system's cost savings. In order to identify which VA facilities would benefit, the VA must develop a uniform regulated medical waste cost analysis model to determine the cost savings associated with the use of an on-site regulated medical waste treatment system.</summary>
