  <summary date="2024-06-24T20:26:39Z" status="Reported to House">Small Business Flexibility Act&#160;

This bill&#160;requires the Internal Revenue Service to notify employers, particularly small businesses, about the availability of individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements (ICHRAs), qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (QSEHRAs), and the small business health care tax credit.

Under ICHRAs, employers agree to reimburse employees for incurred medical expenses up to a limit for a specified period (e.g., a calendar year), and employees obtain their own individual coverage that meets certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (coverage of preventive services and no annual or lifetime limits). QSEHRAs are available to employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees. The small business health care tax credit is available to employers with fewer than 25 full-time employees.</summary>
