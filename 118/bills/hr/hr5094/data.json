    "text": "SNAP Staffing Flexibility Act of 2023\n\nThis bill allows a state agency to hire a contractor to perform Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) certification or other state functions for SNAP\u00a0under certain conditions.\n\nSpecifically, a state agency may hire a contractor when the state experiences an increase in SNAP applications or an inability to timely process such applications from causes that include\u00a0(1) pandemics and other health emergencies, (2) seasonal workforce cycles, (3) temporary staffing shortages, and (4) weather or other natural disasters.\u00a0The bill includes specific parameters for a state agency that hires a contractor based on\u00a0temporary staffing shortages.\n\nThe bill requires that a contractor be part of a blended workforce (i.e., combines government employees and the employees of a for-profit or private nonprofit employer).\u00a0\n\nFurther, a state agency must notify the Department of Agriculture (USDA) of the intent to hire a contractor and provide any information or data supporting state agency increases in SNAP applications or the inability to timely process applications. USDA must make the notification and accompanying information publicly available on the USDA website.\n\nFinally, USDA must submit an annual report to Congress that includes specific information and recommendations, including information on the measures taken by USDA to address increases in SNAP applications.\u00a0\u00a0"
