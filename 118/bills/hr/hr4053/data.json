(A schedule III controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that has less potential for abuse than a schedule I or II substance; that has a currently accepted medical use; and that has low or moderate risk of dependence if abused.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires HHS to review scientific and medical evaluations relating to these products and update its scheduling recommendations accordingly. The DEA must review the recommendations of HHS and make appropriate scheduling changes.\u00a0"
