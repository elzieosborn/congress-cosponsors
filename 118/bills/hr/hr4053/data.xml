  <summary date="2024-06-21T21:40:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Studying Suboxone Act&#160;

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reevaluate the scheduling of buprenorphine-naloxone combination products (e.g., suboxone) under the Controlled Substances Act.&#160;These products are used to treat opioid addictions and are currently schedule III controlled substances. (A schedule III controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that has less potential for abuse than a schedule I or II substance; that has a currently accepted medical use; and that has low or moderate risk of dependence if abused.)

Specifically, the bill requires HHS to review scientific and medical evaluations relating to these products and update its scheduling recommendations accordingly. The DEA must review the recommendations of HHS and make appropriate scheduling changes.&#160;</summary>
