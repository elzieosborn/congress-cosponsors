  <summary date="2024-02-28T21:31:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Electronic Health Record Program Restructure, Enhance, Strengthen, and Empower Technology Act of 2023 or the EHR Program RESET Act of 2023

This bill establishes within the Veterans Health Administration a program to modernize the electronic health record and other relevant health information technology systems of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The bill also establishes the Electronic Health Record and Health Information Technology Modernization Program Management Office and a position of Deputy Chief Information Officer for Electronic Health Record and Health Information Technology to implement the program.

The VA must exceed or meet certain standards at its facilities that are using the Oracle Cerner product before it may initiate new deployments of the product.

The bill requires additional information to be included in the quarterly updates on the Electronic Health Record Modernization Program, such as data on retention, morale, and turnover at sites using the new electronic health record.

Within 275 days after the enactment of this bill, the VA must terminate all of its contracts with Oracle Cerner for training and change management related to electronic health record modernization and cease to issue task orders for such activities from Oracle Cerner or its subcontractors.

The VA must designate one senior official (GS-15 or higher) as the lead negotiator on all current and future contracts relating to the new electronic health record.

The Chief Acquisition Officer of the VA must contract with an entity to independently verify and validate the modernization efforts of certain VA programs (e.g., the Electronic Health Record Modernization Program).</summary>
