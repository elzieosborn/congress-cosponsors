  <summary date="2025-08-20T18:42:38Z" status="Introduced in House">A Stronger Workforce for America Act

This bill reauthorizes through FY2030 and modifies various programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).Specifically, the bill reauthorizes through FY2030 the Job Corps program for low-income youth ages 16 to 24, as well as grant programs for states to provide employment and training services for youth, adults, and dislocated workers through a One-Stop delivery system. It also requires state plans for the grant programs to (1) describe how the state will use real-time labor market information to assess economic conditions and workforce trends, and (2) include an analysis of any gaps in service for applicable youth.Additionally, the bill reauthorizes through FY2030 the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) programs, which provide educational services at or below the secondary level and English language training&#160;for out-of-school adults. It also specifies that the primary performance indicator for these programs includes the percentage of program participants who exit the program during the program year and complete an integrated education and training program.Finally, the bill integrates within the One-Stop delivery system&#160;career services that are funded under the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service (ES) program (a nationwide system of public employment offices).
