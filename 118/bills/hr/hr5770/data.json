Currently, the USGS must ensure that all streamgages are equipped with water-quality sensors. The act requires that those sensors are precipitation water-quality sensors. The act also requires each streamgage site to conform with the federal needs established through regular solicitation and feedback, such as that documented in the report titled Re-prioritization of the U.S. Geological Survey Federal Priority streamgage program, 2022."
