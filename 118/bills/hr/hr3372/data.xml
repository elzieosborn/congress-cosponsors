  <summary date="2024-10-16T14:16:13Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Department of Transportation to establish a pilot program allowing states to issue permits for qualifying vehicles with six or more axles and a gross vehicle weight of up to 91,000 pounds to be operated on a state's Interstate System. (Generally, the federal commercial vehicle weight limit is 80,000 pounds, with some exceptions.) Permit holders must report to the issuing state each accident of a permitted vehicle and the estimated gross vehicle weight at the time of the accident. Permit holders must also annually report to the issuing state the estimated miles travelled by the permitted vehicle on the state's Interstate System.&#160;
