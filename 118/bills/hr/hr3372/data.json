Permit holders must report to the issuing state each accident of a permitted vehicle and the estimated gross vehicle weight at the time of the accident. Permit holders must also annually report to the issuing state the estimated miles travelled by the permitted vehicle on the state's Interstate System.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
