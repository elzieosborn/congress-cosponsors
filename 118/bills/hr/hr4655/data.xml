This bill prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from compelling a publicly traded company to include a shareholder proposal or a discussion of a proposal in a proxy statement. Under current SEC rules, certain qualifying shareholder proposals must be included on a company's proxy statement. Proxy statements are provided to shareholders before shareholder meetings and contain disclosures required by the SEC.</summary>
