    "text": "Transportation Innovation Coordination Act\n\nThis bill directs the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation to study, plan, coordinate, and implement decarbonization of (1) aircraft, airports, and aviation; (2) maritime transportation; and (3) medium- and heavy-duty transportation vehicles. The joint office facilitates collaboration between the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the joint office to support decarbonization\u00a0efforts such as\n\nresearch and technical assistance related to the development, operation, and maintenance of sustainable aircraft, low- or zero-emission vessels, and medium- and heavy-duty transportation vehicles;data sharing on the installation, operation, and maintenance of charging and refueling infrastructure at airports, ports, and freight facilities;the development and deployment of workforce training programs related to charging and refueling infrastructure at airports and ports;the transition from leaded fuel usage by commercial and general aviation; andthe development and establishment of green maritime corridors.The joint office must also support research and funding related to the decarbonization of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and other freight transportation equipment and operations. This includes charging and fueling infrastructure, as well as the development and deployment of alternative sustainable low-carbon fuels, including biofuels, clean hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia, and associated powertrain technologies (e.g., batteries and hydrogen internal combustion engines).\u00a0"
