This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to deactivate the standard unique health identifiers of health care providers that are excluded from federal health care programs because of fraud, waste, or abuse.

The bill also requires (1) any data submitted by Medicare Advantage plans with respect to durable medical equipment, prosthetics or orthotics, laboratory tests, imaging tests, or home health services to include the standard unique health identifier of the associated provider or supplier; and (2) health care practitioners who are employed by or contract with telehealth companies to use a specialized claims modifier (developed by CMS) for Medicare telehealth services.</summary>
