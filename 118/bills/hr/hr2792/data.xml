  <summary date="2023-10-30T13:00:46Z" status="Passed House">Small Entity Update Act 

This bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report on and revise the definition of small entity. Agencies are required to consider the impact of their rules on small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Under the bill, the SEC must provide specific and detailed recommendations to Congress on how the SEC can revise the definition of small entity to (1) align with specified statutory goals, including reducing unnecessary burdens on small entities; and (2) expand the number of entities covered. In addition, the SEC must adjust the appropriate dollar amounts for inflation every five years.

The SEC must also revise the applicable rules to implement these recommendations.</summary>
