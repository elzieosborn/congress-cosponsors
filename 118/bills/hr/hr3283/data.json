Communications use authorizations are requests for easements, rights-of-way, leases, licenses, or other authorizations to locate or modify a transmitting device, support structure, or other communications facility on public lands or National Forest System land.\n\nSpecifically, the NTIA must report to Congress about (1) whether the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service have each established a portal, and (2) barriers to establishing the portals. The NTIA must submit the first report within 90 days of the enactment of the bill and every 60 days thereafter until the portals are established.\n\nAdditionally, Interior and the Forest Service must notify the NTIA within three business days of establishing their respective portals."
