    "text": "Territories Medicare Prescription Drug Assistance Equality Act of 2023\n\nThis bill makes certain income-based subsidies under the Medicare prescription drug benefit available to individuals who reside in Puerto Rico or\u00a0another U.S. territory and are otherwise eligible.\n\nCurrent law makes\u00a0such individuals ineligible for premium and cost-sharing subsidies, but\u00a0establishes a process for\u00a0U.S. territories\u00a0to apply\u00a0for financial assistance with respect to the provision of Medicare prescription drugs. The bill retains a process for U.S. territories to apply for such assistance, but alters the\u00a0formula by\u00a0which the amount of assistance is calculated. Specifically, the bill phases in modifications to the formula that more closely align how assistance is calculated for U.S. territories with how it is calculated for the 50 states and the District of Columbia."
