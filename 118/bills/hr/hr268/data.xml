 This bill eliminates the authority of Congress to nullify recently enacted laws of the District of Columbia (DC).

Current law generally permits Congress to review and disapprove, through a joint resolution, measures enacted by the DC Council. If the President signs the resolution, the measure may not go into effect. The bill eliminates that congressional review process.</summary>
