The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must review current guidance on donor eligibility and, if appropriate, update it with information on how to reduce the spread of tuberculosis or sepsis in association with donations. The FDA must also publish information about\u00a0its Tissue Reference Group and data about FDA inspections and registrations of human cell and tissue establishments.\n\nThe bill also establishes specific civil penalties for violations of regulations governing procedures for human cell and\u00a0tissue products. The FDA must consider and recommend ways to update these regulations after a public comment period."
