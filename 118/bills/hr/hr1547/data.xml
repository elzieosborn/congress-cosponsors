This bill requires the Department of Transportation to conduct a study on the benefits of commuter rail passenger transportation and major obstacles to providing commuter rail passenger transportation that does not involve a transfer for passengers. The study must consider economic, logistical, and quality of life factors. It must also include a cost-benefit analysis of single-seat trips on the New Jersey Transit Raritan Valley line during peak hours and the impact such trips would have on other New Jersey Transit lines.</summary>
