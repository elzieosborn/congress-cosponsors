PDP sponsors may audit\u00a0PBMs to ensure compliance with this bill's requirements and must annually certify their compliance; PBMs are responsible for any associated civil penalties for violations.\n\nIn addition, the Government Accountability Office must study federal and state reporting requirements for health plans and PBMs with respect to prescription drug price transparency and recommend ways to streamline these requirements."
