This bill requires the Department of Labor to award grants to nonprofit organizations to carry out technology training programs in local parks. Training programs must&#160;serve individuals who are receiving unemployment or other specified public assistance benefits, and must result in the award of a postsecondary degree or credential.&#160;

The bill also makes local parks that have contracted with nonprofits to provide technology training under the grant program eligible for discounted telecommunications service under the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support (E-Rate) program.</summary>
