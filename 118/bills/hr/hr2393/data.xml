  <summary date="2023-06-01T20:14:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Combating Cartels on Social Media Act of 2023

This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to report and implement a strategy to combat the use of social media by transnational criminal organizations to recruit individuals in the United States to support illicit activities in the United States or countries near a U.S. international border.

DHS must also identify a designee within U.S. Customs and Border Protection to receive, process, and disseminate information about these social media recruitment activities. The information must be disseminated to federal, tribal, state, and local entities to support appropriate government functions, such as providing actionable intelligence to law enforcement.</summary>
