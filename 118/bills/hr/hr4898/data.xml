This bill establishes the Office of Press Freedom within the Department of State to advance the protection and well-being of members of the press abroad and to engage with foreign governments and global press freedom organizations concerning freedom of the press and of expression.

The office must (1) coordinate efforts between relevant U.S. embassy personnel and press organizations or threatened individuals in situations in which press freedom is threatened abroad, (2) publicly and privately denounce oppression of the press abroad, and (3) recommend appropriate responses by the U.S. government when press freedoms are infringed upon. The office shall be headed by the Ambassador-at-Large for Press Freedom, who shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The State Department must ensure that there is a press freedom curriculum for the National Foreign Affairs Training Center to help Foreign Service officers better understand issues of press freedom and tools that are available to help protect journalists and promote freedom of the press norms. The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on the implementation of the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act of 2009, including how the State Department prepares information for the reports on press freedom that are required by that act.</summary>
