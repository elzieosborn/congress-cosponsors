This bill repeals the guidance that was issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 11, 2021, relating to over-the-counter (OTC) antimicrobial drugs for animals.

The guidance provides information for sponsors of medically important antimicrobial new animal drug products who wish to change the status of these drugs from OTC to veterinary prescription, in accordance with the FDA's recommendation that these drugs be administered with veterinary oversight to reduce the possibility of antimicrobial resistance.</summary>
