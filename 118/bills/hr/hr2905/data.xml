This bill requires the Bureau of the Census, beginning with the 2030 decennial census, to attribute an individual incarcerated in a correctional facility or detention center to the individual's last place of residence before incarceration. Further, a state must treat such an individual's last place of residence in the state before incarceration as the individual's place of residence for purposes of congressional redistricting.</summary>
