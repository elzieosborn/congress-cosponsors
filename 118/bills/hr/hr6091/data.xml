  <summary date="2024-06-06T18:39:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Student Support Act

This bill requires the Department of Education to make matching grants to states for allocation to local educational agencies (LEAs) so that additional school-based mental health and student service providers may be hired, thereby reducing the student-to-provider ratios in elementary and secondary schools to specified minimum levels recommended by the leading counseling, guidance, and mental health organizations.

Grants to states and state allocations to LEAs must be made pursuant to specified formulas that take into account a state's and school district's share of children in poverty. &#160;</summary>
