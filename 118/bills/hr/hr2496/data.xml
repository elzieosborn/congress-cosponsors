This bill provides interim appropriations for the Coast Guard Retired Serviceman's Family Protection and Survivor Benefits Plans if a bill providing appropriations for the plans has not been enacted before the fiscal year begins. The bill provides the appropriations at the rate of operations and under the terms and conditions provided by the most recent law making full-year appropriations for the plans.

The appropriations provided by this bill are not available after a bill is enacted that (1) provides appropriations for the plans, or (2) provides appropriations for the Coast Guard without funding the plans.</summary>
