This bill prohibits the anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation training that is required to be provided to federal employees from (1) being offered at the same time as insider threat training, or (2) including information on insider threats. Under current law, the training is required to address the rights and protections that apply to employees under laws that prohibit employment discrimination and retaliation (e.g., whistleblower protection laws).&#160;</summary>
