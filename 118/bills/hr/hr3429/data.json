    "text": "New Collar Jobs Act of 2023\n\nThis bill provides incentives for cybersecurity education.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes an employee\u00a0cybersecurity education tax credit\u00a0for an employer\u00a0who incurs costs for an employee who earns a certain cybersecurity certificate or degree. If a business claims such a credit, then federal agencies must award a score increase to each competitive proposal submitted by the business for a federal contract valued at more than $5 million.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Education must cancel eligible student loans\u00a0for borrowers who have (1) made 36 consecutive monthly payments, and (2) held a cybersecurity job in an economically distressed area during at least 12 months of payments.\n\nFinally, the bill makes cybersecurity course instructors eligible for awards under the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program."
