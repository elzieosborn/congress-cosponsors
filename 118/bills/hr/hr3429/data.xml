This bill provides incentives for cybersecurity education.

Specifically, the bill establishes an employee&#160;cybersecurity education tax credit&#160;for an employer&#160;who incurs costs for an employee who earns a certain cybersecurity certificate or degree. If a business claims such a credit, then federal agencies must award a score increase to each competitive proposal submitted by the business for a federal contract valued at more than $5 million.

In addition, the Department of Education must cancel eligible student loans&#160;for borrowers who have (1) made 36 consecutive monthly payments, and (2) held a cybersecurity job in an economically distressed area during at least 12 months of payments.

Finally, the bill makes cybersecurity course instructors eligible for awards under the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program.</summary>
