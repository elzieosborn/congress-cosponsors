This bill directs specified agencies to take actions to remediate orbital debris (human-made space objects that are no longer in use and can harm orbiting satellites and on-orbit activities).

The Department of Commerce must&#160;publish and periodically update a list of orbital debris that may be remediated to reduce the risk of harm to orbiting satellites and on-orbit activities. In addition, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) must (1) establish a demonstration program to foster the development of technologies to remediate the orbital debris on the list, and (2)&#160;carry out other research and development activities to advance technologies for remediating orbital debris.

NASA (and other relevant agencies) may also contract for remediation services to support the commercial availability of such services.

Additionally, the National Space Council must update the Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices within 90 days of the enactment of the bill and update them periodically thereafter. The updates must address matters including satellite constellations and other planned space systems, collision risks, and disposal of space systems after missions. The updates must inform (1) regulations of other agencies concerning orbital debris, and (2) bilateral and multilateral discussions with other countries concerning certain space activities.

Finally, Commerce must facilitate the development of standard practices to coordinate on-orbit space traffic. Upon completion of the practices, Commerce and other federal departments must promote their adoption and use for space missions.
