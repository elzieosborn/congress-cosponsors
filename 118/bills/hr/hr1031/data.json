    "text": "Insular Areas College Access Act\n\nThis bill establishes a grant program to cover the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees for students who are residents of an outlying area (i.e., American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, or the Virgin Islands) and who attend a public institution of higher education located in a state, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico.\n\nA student on whose behalf a grant is made must maintain full-time employment within the outlying area for at least two years. Further, a student who completes less than the required two years of employment must repay the grant, or the grant must be treated as a loan that is subject to repayment.\n\nLastly, the Government Accountability Office must report on the program's effectiveness in expanding educational opportunities for these students."
