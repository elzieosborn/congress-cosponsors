This bill reauthorizes through FY2028 and modifies the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) Program. (The FRSAN Program funds projects that aim to maintain a network connecting individuals engaged in farming, ranching, and other agriculture-related occupations to stress assistance programs.)

Specifically, the bill makes individuals engaged in farm work eligible for assistance under the FRSAN Program.

The bill also expands the types of programs eligible for FRSAN grants to include those that deliver peer-to-peer mental health support to individuals who are engaged in farming, ranching, farm work, and other agriculture-related occupations.&#160;</summary>
