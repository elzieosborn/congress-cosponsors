This bill repeals a prohibition barring an individual with certain felony drug convictions from participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Under current law, a state may opt out of enforcing the ban on participation.

The bill also allows an individual who is incarcerated to apply for SNAP benefits before their release date. Specifically, the bill amends the definition of household to include incarcerated individuals who are scheduled to be released from an institution within 30 days. Currently, a state agency may apply to the Food and Nutrition Service for an administrative waiver in order to allow individuals to apply for SNAP benefits up to 30 days prior to release.&#160;&#160; &#160;</summary>
