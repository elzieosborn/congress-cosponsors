This bill addresses school safety and security, with a particular focus on gun safety.

Specifically, the bill directs the U.S. Secret Service to provide guidance to local educational agencies (LEAs) that receive federal funds on preparing a notice to advise parents on purchasing and using a gun safety device. Each LEA that receives federal funds must submit this notice to each parent with a child attending a school served by the LEA.

Additionally, the bill allows certain individuals with a qualifying child or dependent a tax credit, up to $300 in a taxable year, for the purchase of any firearm safety device.

The bill allows LEAs to use Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants for (1) providing de-escalation training to teachers, administrators, and other staff; and (2) establishing school safety specialist positions.

Next, the bill requires LEAs that have expelled a student for bringing a firearm to school to provide the student and the student's parents with confidential mental health services (if the parents do not have the financial means to provide these services).

The bill allows funds under the Community Oriented Policing Services grant program to be used to implement a standardized training program for school resource officers.

The bill also requires certain federal agencies to conduct outreach&#160;to expand the social media presence of SchoolSafety.gov (a website that provides information, resources, and guidance focused on school safety).</summary>
