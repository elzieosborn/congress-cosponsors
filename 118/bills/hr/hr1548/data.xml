This bill excludes from the Paperwork Reduction Act actions taken by the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation within the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, agencies must comply with specific procedures when gathering information from the public.

The bill establishes several exceptions. For example, the office must inform the person receiving the collection of information the reasons the information is being collected, as required under current law.</summary>
