  <summary date="2024-06-05T15:58:30Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes the Office of Colonia Affairs within the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide information and resources about federal programs and funding for colonias. Colonias are economically distressed communities near the U.S.-Mexico border. Under the bill, a community must be determined to be a colonia by USDA on the basis of objective criteria, including the lack of a potable water supply, adequate sewage systems, and decent housing.</summary>
