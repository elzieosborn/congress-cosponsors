This bill directs the Internal Revenue Service to make available a new tax form for certain U.S. citizens living abroad. The form shall allow such individuals to demonstrate nonresidence, and declare foreign income, foreign taxes paid, and U.S. source income from retirement, pension and social security benefits.

The bill also expands the types of income allowed as foreign earned income for purposes of the foreign earned income tax exclusion and sets forth requirements for reporting foreign financial assets.</summary>
