This bill requires providers of certain laboratory&#160;services under Medicare to publish their prices online.

Specifically, providers must publish and update at least annually the discounted cash price or gross charge (as applicable) for their services and, if required by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the minimum and maximum negotiated rates between the provider and insurers. The bill applies to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests&#160;that are included in the list of shoppable services in CMS regulations, excluding advanced diagnostic laboratory tests. Providers that fail to comply with these requirements may be subject to civil penalties.</summary>
