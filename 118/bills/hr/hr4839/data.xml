This bill requires Medicare hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers to publish their prices.

Specifically, hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers must publish pricing information for at least 300 shoppable services designated by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), including the gross charge and discounted cash price. The CMS must establish the method and manner of publication; hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers that have price estimator tools are deemed to be in compliance with the bill's requirements if the tool meets certain specified criteria.

Hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers are subject to civil penalties for noncompliance. The CMS must publish information about the status of each hospital and ambulatory surgical center's compliance.

The bill provides funds for FY2024 to implement these requirements.</summary>
