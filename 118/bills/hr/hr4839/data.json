The CMS must establish the method and manner of publication; hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers that have price estimator tools are deemed to be in compliance with the bill's requirements if the tool meets certain specified criteria.\n\nHospitals and ambulatory surgical centers are subject to civil penalties for noncompliance. The CMS must publish information about the status of each hospital and ambulatory surgical center's compliance.\n\nThe bill provides funds for FY2024 to implement these requirements."
