This act provides continuing FY2024 appropriations to federal agencies through November 17, 2023, and provides emergency funding for disaster relief.

It also extends several expiring programs and authorities, including several Federal Aviation Administration programs, the National Flood Insurance Program, Federal Drug Administration user fees for animal drug applications, and several public health programs.

DIVISION A--CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2024

This division provides continuing FY2024 appropriations to federal agencies through the earlier of November 17, 2023, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act.

It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2024 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2024 begins on October 1, 2023.

The CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2023 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.

This division also provides emergency funding to respond to natural disasters.

(Sec. 101) This section provides FY2024 appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects or activities at the levels and under the conditions included in specified FY2023 appropriations acts. The section also extends several immigration-related programs and specifies several exceptions.

(Sec. 102) This section prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) from funding new or accelerated production of certain projects and other activities and certain multiyear procurements prior to the enactment of the regular annual appropriations act.

(Sec. 103) This section specifies that funds provided by Section 101 of this division shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided in the pertinent appropriations act.

(Sec. 110) This section requires this division to be implemented so that only the most limited funding action permitted by this division is taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities.

(Sec. 111) This section continues funding for certain appropriated entitlements and other mandatory payments with budget authority provided in an FY2023 appropriations act at the rate necessary to maintain program levels under current law.

(Sec. 112) This section permits funding made available by this division for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each department and agency to be apportioned at the rate necessary to avoid furloughs.

(Sec. 113) This section permits funds appropriated by this division to be obligated and expended notwithstanding specified statutory provisions restricting appropriations for foreign assistance, the Department of State, international broadcasting, and intelligence activities in the absence of prior authorizations.

(Sec. 114) This section extends designations of emergency requirements to funds provided by this division that previously carried those designations. (Emergency spending is generally exempt from discretionary spending limits.)

This section also extends other specified designations (e.g. disaster relief funds) to funds provided by this division. (These designations generally allow adjustments to discretionary spending limits to accommodate additional spending for specified purposes.)

(Sec. 115) This section sets forth requirements for the treatment of rescissions when federal agencies implement the funding levels provided by the CR.

(Sec. 119) This section allows USDA to apportion funding at the rate necessary to maintain the current program caseload for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.
