Interior may allow field employees and members of the public to occupy and lease project quarters.\n\nField employees and members of the public shall be prohibited from subleasing housing established pursuant to this bill.\n\nTo the maximum extent practicable, priority for occupancy in project quarters shall be given to field employees.\n\nInterior may allow partners in agreements to collect rents directly from housing occupants.\n\nInterior, upon the expiration of a term of ownership, may renew the housing partnership agreement for terms not to exceed 10 years or may take other specified actions.\n\nThe bill modifies the lease-to-build program to allow Interior to lease federal land and interests in land to qualified persons for the construction of field employee quarters for any period not to exceed 60 years (under current law not to exceed 50 years)."
