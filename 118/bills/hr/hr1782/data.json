It also requires the Coast Guard to apply sanctions to a port controlled by a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nThe bill specifies that the Coast Guard cannot (1) adopt a port security assessment conducted by a state sponsor of terrorism, or (2) enter into an agreement with a state sponsor of terrorism or foreign terrorist organization to assess a port's security measures or share information related to such an assessment.\n\nIf a port is under the jurisdiction of a state sponsor of terrorism, the Coast Guard must deem the port to not have effective anti-terrorism measures and apply certain sanctions, such as requiring vessels arriving from the port to meet certain conditions for entry into the United States."
