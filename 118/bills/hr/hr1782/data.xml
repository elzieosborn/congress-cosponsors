  <summary date="2024-02-28T16:02:51Z" status="Introduced in House">International Port Security Enforcement Act

This bill prohibits the Coast Guard from cooperating with a state sponsor of terrorism or foreign terrorist organization when assessing anti-terrorism security measures at a foreign port. It also requires the Coast Guard to apply sanctions to a port controlled by a state sponsor of terrorism.

The bill specifies that the Coast Guard cannot (1) adopt a port security assessment conducted by a state sponsor of terrorism, or (2) enter into an agreement with a state sponsor of terrorism or foreign terrorist organization to assess a port's security measures or share information related to such an assessment.

If a port is under the jurisdiction of a state sponsor of terrorism, the Coast Guard must deem the port to not have effective anti-terrorism measures and apply certain sanctions, such as requiring vessels arriving from the port to meet certain conditions for entry into the United States.</summary>
