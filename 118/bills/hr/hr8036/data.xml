  <summary date="2024-09-17T12:31:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024

This bill provides FY2024 supplemental appropriations for the Department of State and the Department of Defense (DOD) to support U.S. allies and activities in the Indo-Pacific region. The bill designates the funding as emergency spending, which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.

The bill provides funding to DOD and the State Department for purposes such as

 providing replacements or reimbursements for defense articles and services that DOD provided to Taiwan and countries that have supported Taiwan, improving the submarine industrial base, unfunded priorities of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command for FY2024, Defense Production Act purchases, the Foreign Military Financing Program, and a contribution to the International Development Association. The bill also expands the authorities of the President to transfer defense articles and services from DOD to foreign countries or international organizations.</summary>
