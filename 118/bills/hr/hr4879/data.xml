This bill establishes stricter requirements for Chinese companies that are publicly traded.

Under current law, the Securities and Exchange Commission must delist from an exchange a publicly traded company that uses, for two consecutive years, an accounting firm not subject to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board inspections.

The bill reduces this to one year for companies that are organized under Chinese laws. &#160;</summary>
