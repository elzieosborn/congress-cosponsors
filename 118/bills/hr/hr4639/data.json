Intermediary service providers (commonly referred to as data brokers) are companies that deliver, store, or process communications for RCS and ECS providers.\n\nThe bill also limits the authority of law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies to access certain customer and subscriber records or illegitimately obtained information. With respect to such records, the bill\n\n prohibits law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies from obtaining the records or information from a third party in exchange for anything of value (e.g., purchasing them); prohibits other government agencies from sharing the records or information with law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies; and prohibits the use of such records or information in any trial, hearing, or proceeding. Additionally, the bill requires the government to obtain a court order before aquiring certain customer and subscriber records or any illegitimately obtained information from a third party."
