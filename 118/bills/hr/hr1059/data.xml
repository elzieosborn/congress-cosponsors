  <summary date="2023-03-10T15:13:59Z" status="Passed House">Securing and Enabling Commerce Using Remote and Electronic Notarization Act of 2023 or the SECURE Notarization Act of 2023 

This bill allows a notary public commissioned under state law to remotely notarize electronic records and perform notarizations for remotely located individuals. The bill provides technical requirements for the notarizations, including the creation and retention of video and audio recordings and the use of communication technologies (i.e., video chat).

Additionally, the bill requires U.S. courts and states to recognize notarizations&#8212;including remote notarizations of electronic records and notarizations of remotely-located individuals&#8212;that occur in or affect interstate commerce and are performed by a notary public commissioned under the laws of other states.

The bill also allows a notary public to remotely notarize electronic records involving an individual located outside of the United States, subject to certain requirements.</summary>
