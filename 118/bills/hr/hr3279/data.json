They may also charge reasonable, cost-based fees for (1) reviewing requests to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities; or (2) using property owned or managed by the state or locality for placing, constructing, or modifying a facility.\n\nAdditionally, states and localities must respond to requests to place, construct, or modify facilities by specified deadlines. If a decision is not made by the deadline, the request is deemed to be approved."
