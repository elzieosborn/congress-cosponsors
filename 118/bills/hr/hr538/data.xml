This bill requires manufacturers of internet-connected devices (e.g., smart appliances) that are equipped with a camera or microphone to disclose to consumers that a camera or microphone is part of the device.

The bill does not apply to mobile phones, laptops, or other devices that a consumer would reasonably expect to include a camera or microphone.</summary>
