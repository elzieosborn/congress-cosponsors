  <summary date="2024-05-24T22:29:58Z" status="Passed House">Abandoned Well Remediation Research and Development Act

This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a research, development, and demonstration program concerning abandoned oil and gas wells. Under the program, DOE must work to improve (1) data collection on the location of abandoned oil or gas wells; (2) the plugging, remediation, reclamation, and repurposing of the wells; and (3) strategies to mitigate potential environmental impacts of documented and undocumented abandoned wells. The program terminates after five years.</summary>
