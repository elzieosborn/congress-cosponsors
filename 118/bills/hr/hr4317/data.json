This bill requires these records to also include lists of the names and addresses of all registrants who were inactive (i.e., the registrant failed to respond to a notice about a change in residence) and the length of time each registrant was inactive.\n\nThe bill also requires each state to biennially submit a report to the Election Assistance Commission that includes information about inactive registrants in the state."
