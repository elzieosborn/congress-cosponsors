  <summary date="2023-11-17T16:27:06Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill revises requirements related to public disclosure of official lists of eligible voters.

Currently, each state must maintain for public disclosure, for a minimum two-year period, all records pertaining to the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters. This bill requires these records to also include lists of the names and addresses of all registrants who were inactive (i.e., the registrant failed to respond to a notice about a change in residence) and the length of time each registrant was inactive.

The bill also requires each state to biennially submit a report to the Election Assistance Commission that includes information about inactive registrants in the state.</summary>
