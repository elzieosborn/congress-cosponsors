    "text": "Amendment for Crowdfunding Capital Enhancement and Small-business Support Act of 2023 or the ACCESS Act of 2023 \n\nThis bill expands the exemption from certain disclosures applicable to crowdfunding issuers with specified target offering amounts. Crowdfunding is used to raise capital through a large number of individuals investing potentially small amounts of money. Under current law, crowdfunding issuers that have target offering amounts of $100,000 or less are not required to make available financial statements reviewed by an independent public accountant. The bill increases that amount to $250,000.\u00a0"
