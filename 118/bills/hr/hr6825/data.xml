This bill expands the exemption from certain disclosures applicable to crowdfunding issuers with specified target offering amounts. Crowdfunding is used to raise capital through a large number of individuals investing potentially small amounts of money. Under current law, crowdfunding issuers that have target offering amounts of $100,000 or less are not required to make available financial statements reviewed by an independent public accountant. The bill increases that amount to $250,000.&#160;</summary>
