This bill establishes separate payment under Medicare for certain items that are needed to detect venous needle dislodgement in individuals who undergo home dialysis.

Specifically, the bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop a separate payment system for monitoring and alarm devices that are used to detect venous needle dislodgement in home dialysis patients. The CMS may consult with device manufacturers, providers, patients, and insurers to develop the payment system and may consider factors such as costs, payments for similar items under Medicare, and payments established by private insurers.</summary>
