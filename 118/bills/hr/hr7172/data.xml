This bill directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to issue regulations that require casks used in dry storage systems for spent nuclear fuel (i.e., nuclear waste) to be capable of operating safely for at least 100 years. Specifically, the regulations must prohibit the NRC from issuing or renewing any certificate of compliance or license for a dry storage cask for spent nuclear fuel without a finding that the cask can safely operate with spent nuclear fuel for a period of at least 100 years. Under current NRC regulations, a cask must be designed to operate safely for the term&#160;proposed in the license, which may not exceed 40 years.</summary>
