It also extends, modifies, or establishes various programs and authorities throughout the federal government.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides continuing FY2025 appropriations to federal agencies through the earlier of March 14, 2025, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2025 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires after December 20, 2024.\n\nThe CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2024 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.\n\nThe bill provides emergency funding to various federal agencies for assistance related to hurricanes, droughts, floods, and other natural disasters.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the bill extends several expiring programs and authorities, including provisions related to\u00a0\n\nagriculture;public health, Medicare, and Medicaid;\u00a0child welfare;\u00a0telecommunications;protecting certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft systems;cybersecurity;\u00a0\u00a0foreign affairs;older Americans;\u00a0andworkforce development.\u00a0The bill also includes several additional provisions that establish or modify various programs and authorities that address a wide range of policy issues.\u00a0"
