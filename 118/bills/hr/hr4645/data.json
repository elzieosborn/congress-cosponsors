Under the bill, these funds must (1) vote shares according to instructions from the beneficial owner of the securities, (2) vote shares according to the voting instructions of the issuer, or (3) abstain from voting.\n\nThe bill establishes an exemption for routine matters, such as an election to the board of directors. Additionally, the bill establishes a safe harbor from liability for investment advisers for (1) not soliciting voting instructions from beneficial owners, (2) voting shares according to the voting instructions of the issuer, or (3) abstaining from voting."
