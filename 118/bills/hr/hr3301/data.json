This excludes the projects from relevant reviews that are required under those acts.\n\nThe projects must be carried out (1) within an area for which the President has declared a major disaster or an emergency, and (2)\u00a0not later than five years after the date on which the President made the declaration.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
