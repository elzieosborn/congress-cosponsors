This bill excludes from specified environmental and historic preservation reviews certain&#160;projects to replace or improve communications facilities following a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency.

In particular, it specifies such projects are not considered major federal actions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or undertakings under the National Historic Preservation Act. This excludes the projects from relevant reviews that are required under those acts.

The projects must be carried out (1) within an area for which the President has declared a major disaster or an emergency, and (2)&#160;not later than five years after the date on which the President made the declaration.&#160;
