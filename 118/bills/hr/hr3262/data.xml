  <summary date="2024-01-12T20:07:50Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires certain health care entities to disclose specific information about their ownership and finances.

Specifically, the bill requires entities, subject to civil penalties, to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) information relating to mergers, acquisitions, and changes in ownership over the previous year, as well as information on the entity's parent company, if applicable.

The requirements apply to hospitals, certain ambulatory surgical centers, independent freestanding emergency departments, physician-owned practices that have more than 25 physicians, and physician practices that are owned by a hospital, health plan, private equity company, or venture capital firm.

Hospitals must also report information about their business structure, debts, real estate transactions, and certain investments.

HHS must post a summary of the reported information on its website, including trends in consolidation.</summary>
