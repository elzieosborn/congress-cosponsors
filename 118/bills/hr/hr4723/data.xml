  <summary date="2023-11-21T19:40:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Upholding the Dayton Peace Agreement Through Sanctions Act

This bill imposes visa- and property-blocking sanctions on foreign persons (i.e., individuals or entities) that are involved in certain actions that threaten the peace, stability, or democracy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The President must impose such sanctions on certain foreign persons, including those that are responsible for or engaged in corruption or certain acts or policies that seek to (1) threaten the peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina; (2) undermine democratic processes or institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina; or (3) undermine the Dayton Peace Agreement or certain authorities related to the agreement. (The agreement brought an end to the Bosnian War, and Bosnia and Herzegovina's constitution stems in part from the agreement.)

The Department of the Treasury may impose certain prohibitions and restrictions on a foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts or facilitates a significant transaction for a foreign person subject to sanctions under this bill.

The bill also provides statutory authority for sanctions imposed under Executive Order 13219 and Executive Order 14033 (both orders impose sanctions on persons threatening stability in the Western Balkans).</summary>
