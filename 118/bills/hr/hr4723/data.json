(The agreement brought an end to the Bosnian War, and Bosnia and Herzegovina's constitution stems in part from the agreement.)\n\nThe Department of the Treasury may impose certain prohibitions and restrictions on a foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts or facilitates a significant transaction for a foreign person subject to sanctions under this bill.\n\nThe bill also provides statutory authority for sanctions imposed under Executive Order 13219 and Executive Order 14033 (both orders impose sanctions on persons threatening stability in the Western Balkans)."
