This bill generally applies federal antitrust laws to ocean common carriers. It also provides statutory authority for the current exemption from such laws for assessment agreements involving collectively bargained fringe benefit obligations.

The bill also authorizes the Federal Maritime Commission to formally comment on mergers and acquisitions of common carriers and marine terminal operators that are under review by the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division.</summary>
