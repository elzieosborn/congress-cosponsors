  <summary date="2024-05-31T10:42:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Restore Everyone's Sleep Tonight Act of 2023&#160;or the REST Act of 2023

This bill authorizes an airport to impose an access restriction&#160;(i.e., a prohibition on the landing or takeoff of aircraft)&#160;between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. for aircraft, with exceptions.

The authorization to impose the restriction does not apply to exceptional circumstances, such as (1) a scheduled flight that is delayed in takeoff&#160;or landing due to weather; (2) emergency flights; and (3) flights for the purpose of preserving life, health, or safety.

An airport may impose a noise deterrence penalty on an air carrier or aircraft operator for a violation of the access restriction.

The restriction does not apply to the operation of military, law enforcement, and U.S. Coast Guard flights.

Further, the bill specifies that an airport may impose the restriction without approval or comment by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation, any air carrier or aircraft operator, or any other entity.&#160;
