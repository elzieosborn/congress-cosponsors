This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to provide certain information to a state election official, upon the official's request, to verify citizenship status for the purpose of voting in federal elections.

Specifically, the agencies must provide the state election official with such information necessary to verify that an applicant for voter registration or a registrant on the official list of eligible voters is a U.S. citizen.

DHS may respond to a request by using the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program, which is used to verify immigration status. DHS may not charge a fee for this information.

DHS must comply with any safeguards that the SSA determines are necessary to protect the confidentiality of an individual's Social Security number.

Finally, the bill requires states to remove the names of noncitizens from their official lists of eligible voters.</summary>
