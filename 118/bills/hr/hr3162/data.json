DHS may not charge a fee for this information.\n\nDHS must comply with any safeguards that the SSA determines are necessary to protect the confidentiality of an individual's Social Security number.\n\nFinally, the bill requires states to remove the names of noncitizens from their official lists of eligible voters."
