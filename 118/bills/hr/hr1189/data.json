For the purposes of this bill, a foreign adversary is China or any foreign government or nongovernment person (entity or individual) engaged in certain conduct that significantly and adversely affects U.S. security.\n\nThe President must seek to enter into agreements with allies and partners to prevent such goods and technologies from being available to foreign adversaries.\n\nFurthermore, the Department of Commerce must determine the appropriate level of export and transfer controls for such technologies under the Export Administration Regulations.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of State to develop a strategy to prevent such goods and technologies from being available to foreign adversaries. The President must report annually to Congress on this strategy."
