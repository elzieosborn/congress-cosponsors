This bill directs the President to establish and update, every 90 days, a publicly available database that contains records of

 the name of each visitor at the White House, the residence of the Vice President, or any other location at which the President or Vice President regularly conducts official business; the name of each individual with whom the visitor met; and the purpose of the visit. The President shall not include in the database any such record (1) the posting of which would implicate personal privacy or law enforcement concerns or threaten national security, or (2) relating to a purely personal guest.

For a particularly sensitive meeting, the President shall (1) include in the database the number of visitors, and (2) post the applicable records in the database when their release is no longer sensitive.</summary>
