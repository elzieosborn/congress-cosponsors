The President shall not include in the database any such record (1) the posting of which would implicate personal privacy or law enforcement concerns or threaten national security, or (2) relating to a purely personal guest.\n\nFor a particularly sensitive meeting, the President shall (1) include in the database the number of visitors, and (2) post the applicable records in the database when their release is no longer sensitive."
