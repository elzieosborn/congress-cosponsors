This bill requires that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) include infant food combinations&#160;and dinners as part of the program. (The WIC food packages provide supplemental foods designed to address the specific nutritional needs of income-eligible pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum individuals, infants, and children up to five years of age who are at nutritional risk.)

Specifically, the Department of Agriculture must update the regulations that prescribe&#160;the supplemental foods that must be made available in the program.&#160;Currently, infant food combinations&#160;(e.g., meat and vegetables)&#160;and dinners (e.g., spaghetti and meatballs)&#160;are not allowed.&#160;</summary>
