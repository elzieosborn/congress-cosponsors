GSA may provide exceptions to the fees if the exceptions (1) are competitively neutral with respect to the categories of individuals or entities that are granted exceptions, and (2) serve a public benefit and the interest of expanding broadband deployment. The bill limits an agency's use of the fees to amounts made available in advance through appropriations acts."
