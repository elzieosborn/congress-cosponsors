This bill establishes an advisory committee for the&#160;Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). (The PHEMCE identifies national health security needs and recommends related countermeasures and strategies to address those needs.)

The committee must support the&#160;PHEMCE&#160;by soliciting stakeholder input, coordinating with other government entities, helping to communicate decisions, and generally providing advice regarding the&#160;PHEMCE's&#160;duties.
