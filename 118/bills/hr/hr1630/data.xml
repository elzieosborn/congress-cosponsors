  <summary date="2023-04-14T14:57:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Preparing and Resourcing Our Student Parents and Early Childhood Teachers Act or the PROSPECT Act

This bill establishes various grant programs to increase the supply of, and access to, high-quality, early-childhood care. Specifically, grants are established for

 planning and developing expanded access to free infant and toddler child care for student parents attending community college or minority-serving institutions; providing free infant and toddler child care to such student parents, including developing on-campus child care centers that meet specified requirements; training, mentorships, and technical support to community child care agencies and the professional development of licensed and unlicensed child care professionals; and increasing the workforce pipeline of high-quality infant and toddler child care providers, particularly in locations with a low supply of affordable care. The bill also revises the formula for providing federal matching funds to states providing child care assistance.

Further, the bill requires the Department of Education&#8217;s college cost calculator to include information about the dependent care allowance with respect to the cost of attendance and financial aid.</summary>
