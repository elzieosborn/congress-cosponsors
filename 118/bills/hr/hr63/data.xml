This bill establishes that an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship includes a hardship resulting from a removal (or deportation) that separates the individual subject to removal from a family member who is a U.S. citizen, a lawful permanent resident, or lawfully admitted into the United States.

Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security may cancel the removal of a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) if the removal would result in an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to an immediate relative who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.</summary>
