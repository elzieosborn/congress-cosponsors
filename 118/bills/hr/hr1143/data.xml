This bill prohibits the President and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from declaring a federal emergency relating to abortion.

Specifically, neither the President nor HHS may declare a national emergency for purposes of (1) promoting, supporting, or expanding access to abortion; or (2) taking adverse action against or litigating against states that prohibit or otherwise restrict abortion.</summary>
