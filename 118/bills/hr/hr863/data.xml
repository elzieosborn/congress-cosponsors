  <summary date="2023-06-26T11:42:12Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes new criminal offenses related to furnishing sexually explicit material (i.e., books, magazines, newspapers, or other printed material and digital or electronic books) to elementary or secondary schools or state or local educational agencies. It also prohibits federal funds for schools that obtain or educational agencies that distribute such material.

Specifically, the bill makes it a crime for a president, director, manager, or officer of a publishing house to knowingly authorize the furnishing of published material containing a sexually explicit visual depiction to schools or educational agencies. A violator is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to five years, or both.

The bill imposes a fine on a publishing house that knowingly furnishes such published material to schools or educational agencies.

The bill also prohibits federal funds from being provided to (1) schools that knowingly obtain such published material, and (2) educational agencies that knowingly distribute such material to schools.

The bill includes exceptions for material with serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</summary>
