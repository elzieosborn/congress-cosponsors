    "text": "Satellite And Telecommunications Streamlining Act or the SAT Streamlining Act\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to revise its regulations that govern licenses and grants of U.S. market access for geostationary and non-geostationary orbital satellites. Geostationary orbital satellites maintain a stationary position in orbit while non-geostationary satellites move in relation to the Earth's surface; these satellites may be used to provide broadband and other telecommunications services.\n\nIn particular, the bill specifies deadlines by which the FCC must decide whether to approve an application for a license or grant of market access. Generally, the FCC must make a decision on (1) an initial application or a major modification of an application within one year, (2) a renewal of an application within 180 days, and (3) a minor modification of an application within 90 days. The bill allows the FCC to extend the deadlines in some instances, such as when an application raises national security and law enforcement concerns.\n\nFurthermore, the FCC regulations must include performance objectives for space safety and orbital debris that are specific, measurable, and technology-neutral.\n\nThe FCC must also include requirements related to the sharing of the electromagnetic spectrum band by licensees and grantees. For example, the FCC must (1) require licensees and grantees to make a good faith effort to coordinate their use of the spectrum with others, and (2) establish a quantifiable level of protection from harmful interference for other authorized users of the spectrum."
