    "text": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention Improvements Act of 2023\n\nThis bill addresses sexual harassment and sexual assault involving personnel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThe bill specifies that NOAA's sexual harassment prevention and response policy applies to personnel such as observers, at-sea monitors, and voting members and staff of regional fishery management councils.\n\nThe bill removes the requirement that certain acts, such as assault, intimidation, and sexual harassment of an observer or a data collector, be forcible in nature to be unlawful.\n\nThe bill also requires NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations to establish a policy for reporting to the Coast Guard the names of NOAA personnel who are the subject of certain claims. Specifically, such reports must identify employees or contractors who are the subject of a claim of an act or offense detrimental to good discipline and safety at sea (e.g., a claim of sexual assault substantiated by an investigation) or any other substantiated claim of an act or offense for which suspension or revocation of a credential is either mandatory or sought pursuant to certain Coast Guard regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the bill directs NOAA to develop a restricted reporting system that allows employees and other personnel to confidentially report sexual harassment or assault and receive services without triggering an investigation.\n\nFinally, the bill also expands reporting requirements on sexual harassment, sexual assault, and equal employment."
