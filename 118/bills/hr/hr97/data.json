For example, the bill allows such personnel to take (e.g., harm or kill) endangered or threatened species.\n\nIn addition, the bill expands restrictions on the Department of the Interior designating defense-related areas as critical habitat. It also exempts the Department of Defense from certain requirements to consult with Interior about critical habitats."
