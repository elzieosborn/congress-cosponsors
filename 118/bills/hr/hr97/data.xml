This bill establishes exemptions from the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) for defense-related purposes.

Specifically, the bill establishes exemptions from the ESA for (1) operations related to national defense, and (2) military personnel engaged in such operations. For example, the bill allows such personnel to take (e.g., harm or kill) endangered or threatened species.

In addition, the bill expands restrictions on the Department of the Interior designating defense-related areas as critical habitat. It also exempts the Department of Defense from certain requirements to consult with Interior about critical habitats.</summary>
