  <summary date="2023-02-06T22:26:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits the use of federal funds to allow an individual who is not a U.S. citizen to vote in any election in the District of Columbia (DC). Further, DC must certify that it does not allow noncitizens to vote in elections as a condition of receiving any federal funds.

Federal law bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections; however, the DC Council passed a bill on October 18, 2022, that allows noncitizens who meet residency and other requirements to vote in local elections.</summary>
