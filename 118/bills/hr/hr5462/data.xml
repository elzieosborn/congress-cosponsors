  <summary date="2024-10-03T13:06:35Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires that meat and poultry labels include the slaughter date, package date, freeze date (for frozen products), and country of origin or U.S. state of origin.&#160;

Specifically, a meat or poultry product that fails to include this information on the label shall be deemed misbranded. (A misbranded food does not meet certain Department of Agriculture&#160;labeling requirements and may not be sold.)&#160;</summary>
