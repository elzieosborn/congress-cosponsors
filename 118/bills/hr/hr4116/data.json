This report must be made no later than 60 days after such a determination and again 180 days afterwards.\n\nThe Governmental Accountability Office (GAO) must report on additional factors in its report regarding such a determination. Specifically, GAO must report on any mismanagement by the executives and board of the institution, a review of the institution's compensation practices, supervisory or regulatory shortcomings, actions taken by regulators, and other relevant information. The bill also requires this report to be made no later than 60 days after such a determination and again 180 days afterwards."
