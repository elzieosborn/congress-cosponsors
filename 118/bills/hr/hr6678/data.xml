This bill makes certain acts related to Social Security or identification document fraud a ground for (1) barring a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) from admission into the United States, or (2) deporting the individual.

Specifically, this ground shall apply to an individual who has been convicted of the relevant offense or has admitted to committing the acts which constitute the essential elements of the offense. Offenses that trigger this ground of inadmissibility and deportability include (1) knowingly and without lawful authority producing a false identification document, and (2) making a false statement of material fact in an application for Social Security disability benefits.</summary>
