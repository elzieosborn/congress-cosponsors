  <summary date="2024-03-05T13:56:21Z" status="Introduced in House">More Options to Develop and Enhance Remote Nutrition in WIC Act of 2023 or the MODERN WIC Act of 2023

 This bill permanently allows individuals to remotely certify their eligibility for, and receive benefits through, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Specifically, the bill allows an individual seeking a WIC certification, recertification, or a nutritional risk evaluation to do so by phone or through video teleconference, in addition to the in-person option. The bill also allows states to provide benefits on WIC electronic benefit transfer cards through mail or remote issuance instead of requiring participants to pick up or reload benefits in person at a WIC office.

The bill also reauthorizes Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) WIC funding for infrastructure, management information systems, and special nutrition education through FY2029. Specified funds must be used to establish, develop, improve, replace, or administer technology platforms that allow for secure communication between health care providers and program clinics under the program.

Further, the Department of Agriculture must report to Congress about the use of remote technologies and other digital tools in the WIC program.

Under current law, individuals are generally required to be physically present to certify their WIC eligibility and receive benefits, with exceptions. The FNS has temporarily waived these requirements and allowed remote certification and benefits using authorities that were originally provided by laws that were enacted to address the COVID-19 pandemic.</summary>
