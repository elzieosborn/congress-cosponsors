    "text": "Store On-Board Wheelchairs in Cabin Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires an air carrier (including a foreign air carrier) to provide information and training on requirements for onboard wheelchairs.\n\nSpecifically, in the case of an aircraft that is required to be equipped with an onboard wheelchair, an air carrier must provide information on its website (and in any place where a passenger can make a reservation) on the rights and responsibilities of both passengers and air carriers. This information must include the requirement that aircraft with more than 60 passenger seats and an accessible lavatory must be equipped with an onboard wheelchair.\n\nAn air carrier must also require that all personnel who regularly interact with the traveling public, including contractors, complete annual training regarding assisting a qualified individual with a disability. The training must include information on the availability of accessible lavatories and onboard wheelchairs and the right to request an onboard wheelchair.\n\nThe Department of Transportation must conduct a public awareness campaign on the rights of qualified individuals with a disability.\n\nThe bill provides for increased civil penalties against an air carrier for failure to equip an aircraft with an onboard wheelchair."
