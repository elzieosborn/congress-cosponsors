Active-duty family members are dependents (e.g., spouses and children who are under the age of 21) of members of the uniformed services who are on active duty for a period of more than 30 days. Additionally, children who are under the age of 26 and are not eligible for an employer-sponsored health care plan are also eligible for such waiver under TRICARE Select.\u00a0"
