  <summary date="2023-06-23T13:54:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Protect America&#8217;s Innovation and Economic Security from CCP Act

This bill reestablishes an initiative related to China within the National Security Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and outlines the goals and requirements for this initiative.

In 2022, DOJ ended a program named the China Initiative. This bill reestablishes and renames it the CCP Initiative to (1) counter nation-state threats to the United States; (2) curb spying by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions; (3) identify and prosecute individuals engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage; and (4) protect U.S. critical infrastructure from foreign threats.

DOJ must annually brief specified congressional committees on the progress and challenges of the initiative.

The initiative terminates six years after enactment of this bill.</summary>
