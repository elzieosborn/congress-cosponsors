Specifically, the SEC must provide that an issuer of securities is only required to disclose information in response to a rulemaking if the issuer determines that this information is material with respect to a voting or investment decision regarding the issuer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s securities.\n\nThe bill also requires the SEC to report on its website each required disclosure of nonmaterial information under current federal securities laws and regulations and a justification for the disclosure. The SEC must report this information to Congress every five years. The bill also establishes that a person's failure to disclose such nonmaterial information is not a liability in a private action.\n\nFurther, the bill establishes the Public Company Advisory Committee within the SEC. The committee must advise the SEC on regulatory priorities, public reporting and corporate governance of public companies, shareholder meetings and the proxy process, and other topics. The committee must be comprised of individuals who are officials of public companies, have senior managerial responsibility in associations that represent the interests of public companies, or provide professional advice and services to public companies. \u00a0\n\nFinally, the bill requires the SEC to report on the effects of the European Union's directives on corporate sustainability, particularly on U.S. companies, consumers, and investors. \u00a0"
