This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to complete a study assessing the potential and existing use of pipelines constructed with composite materials to safely transport hydrogen and hydrogen blended with natural gas. In completing the study, DOT must hold a public meeting with interested stakeholders, release a draft version of the study for public comment, and address any substantive comments submitted during the public comment period.

DOT must present the study's findings at a public meeting. Within 18 months of the public meeting, DOT must issue a rulemaking to allow for the use of composite materials for pipeline transportation of hydrogen and hydrogen blended with natural gas.</summary>
