Furthermore, the President must launch an international initiative to modernize outreach to embarking civil nuclear nations to improve the importation and exportation of civil nuclear technology and materials. This initiative may include establishing cooperative financing relationships for the export of such technology and materials.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the Department of Energy to support regulatory development, design, and deployment activities related to certain small modular reactor projects."
