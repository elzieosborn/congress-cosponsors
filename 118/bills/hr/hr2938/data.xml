  <summary date="2024-02-26T21:03:25Z" status="Introduced in House">International Nuclear Energy Act of 2023

This bill addresses U.S. cooperation with other nations on nuclear energy-related issues.

For example, the bill requires

 the President, in coordination with international partners, to hold a biennial conference on civil nuclear safety, security, safeguards, and sustainability; the Department of State to meet with ally or partner nations for the purpose of collaborating on research, development, licensing, and deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies for civil nuclear energy; the State Department to provide financial assistance to embarking civil nuclear nations for developing civil nuclear energy programs; and the establishment of a working group to develop a 10-year civil nuclear trade strategy with biennial targets for the export of civil nuclear technologies. Furthermore, the President must launch an international initiative to modernize outreach to embarking civil nuclear nations to improve the importation and exportation of civil nuclear technology and materials. This initiative may include establishing cooperative financing relationships for the export of such technology and materials.

The bill also authorizes the Department of Energy to support regulatory development, design, and deployment activities related to certain small modular reactor projects.</summary>
