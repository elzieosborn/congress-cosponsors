    "text": "Building Up Farmland Frontiers for Ecological Resilience Act or the BUFFER Act\n\nThis bill provides that certain land (that is under state regulations) is\u00a0eligible to participate under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Under CRP, the Department of Agriculture provides annual payments to agricultural producers to take highly erodible and environmentally sensitive land out of production and install resource-conserving practices.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, land otherwise eligible under the program remains eligible for enrollment even if a tribal, state, or other local law, ordinance, or other regulation requires any resource-conserving or environmental protection measure or practice. The bill includes an exception that makes the land ineligible\u00a0under the program if the implementation\u00a0requirement has been imposed by an administrative order or a court order.\n\nCurrent regulations\u00a0exclude from enrollment eligibility (with exceptions) land that is subject to tribal, state, or other local laws, ordinances, or other regulations that require any resource-conserving or environmental protection measures or practices."
