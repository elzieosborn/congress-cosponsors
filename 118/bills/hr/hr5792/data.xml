This bill provides whistle-blower protections for certain employees who work in the offshore oil and gas industry.&#160;

Specifically, the&#160;bill prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against an employee working in waters above the Outer Continental Shelf because the employee (1) reported or testified about violations of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), unsafe conditions, or the adequacy of any oil spill response plan required by law; or (2) refused to work based on a reasonable belief that the work could violate the OCSLA, cause an injury or impairment to the health of an employee, or cause an oil spill.

The bill establishes procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of a whistle-blower complaint.&#160;

Additionally, employers are required to

post a workplace notice approved by the Department of Labor explaining employee rights and remedies;provide training to employees about their rights within 30 days of employment, and annually thereafter; andprovide employees with a card containing a toll-free telephone number for obtaining information or for filing a complaint.&#160;</summary>
