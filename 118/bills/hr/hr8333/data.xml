  <summary date="2024-09-11T21:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">BIOSECURE Act

This bill prohibits entities that receive federal funds from using biotechnology that is from a company associated with a foreign adversary.

Specifically, federal agencies and recipients of federal funds (e.g., grantees) may not procure or use any biotechnology equipment or service that is from a biotechnology company of concern and may not contract with any entities that do so. A&#160;biotechnology company of concern is an entity that is under the control of a foreign adversary and that poses a risk to national security based on its research or multiomic data collection (e.g., collection of genomic information).

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must, in coordination with the Department of Defense (DOD) and other specified agencies, develop a list of prohibited companies; the list must include five particular companies, as specified in the bill. OMB and DOD&#160;may approve waivers of these restrictions on an as-needed basis, which are valid for up to one year and may be extended once for an additional 180 days.

In addition, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence must report on the national security risks posed by (1) multiomic data collection by foreign adversaries in connection with biotechnology equipment or services, and (2) biotechnology companies that have such data.</summary>
