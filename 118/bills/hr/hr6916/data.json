    "text": "This bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study to examine how states provide outreach to food insecure veterans in the state as part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Specifically, the GAO must examine how states with reported high and low rates of food insecurity (1) target veterans in the state annual outreach plans to carry out SNAP, and (2) coordinate efforts with Veterans Health Administration facilities to help connect veterans to the program.\n\nThe study must also identify (1) any challenges states face in addressing food insecurity among veterans, (2) how states have coordinated efforts with Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) and other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that help connect veterans with nutrition assistance programs, and (3) any best practices for increasing program enrollment for eligible non-participating households that include veterans."
