This bill modifies the framework for providing foreign aid to programs that support vulnerable children by expanding the goals of these programs and requiring additional reports.

Specifically, aid may be provided to programs that (1) support family care for vulnerable children and extend protective services to children living outside of family care; (2) promote the protection of children from violence, exploitation, abuse, and neglect through preventative and responsive programming; and (3) provide lifesaving protection and interventions for vulnerable children in emergency settings.

The bill also requires the President, among other reporting requirements, to develop and submit to Congress a strategy for coordinating, implementing, and monitoring assistance programs for children in adversity, submitting a review to Congress every 4 years afterwards.</summary>
