    "text": "This bill addresses Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits and care for certain children with spina bifida or other birth defects. The bill requires the VA to provide health care, job training, and monetary benefits for the duration of the child's life. The bills covers a child, regardless of age or marital status, who: (1) has spina bifida and is the natural child of a Vietnam veteran or a veteran of specified service in Korea or Thailand who was conceived after the date on which the veteran entered service in Vietnam, Korea, or Thailand; or (2) has certain birth defects and is the natural child of a woman Vietnam veteran.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to establish an advisory council on health care and benefits for covered children. Additionally, the VA must establish care and coordination teams for covered children. At least every 180 days, the teams must conduct outreach to ensure the continued care of the children and assist with any necessary changes in care.\n\nThe VA must report to Congress a list of conditions that will trigger outreach to covered children, and must attempt to contact such children as soon as practicable after the identification of a condition.\n\nThe Veterans Benefits Administration and the Veterans Health Administration must enter into a memorandum of understanding to better assist covered children."
