  <summary date="2023-04-19T15:03:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act 

 This bill imposes penalties on certain state and local governments that do not assist federal immigration enforcement actions.

Specifically, a state or local government shall be ineligible for federal financial assistance for at least one year if it restricts or prohibits an agency or official from (1) communicating with the responsible federal immigration agency regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status, or (2) maintaining or exchanging information about an individual's status. (Jurisdictions that take such actions are sometimes referred to as sanctuary cities or sanctuary jurisdictions.)

 The bill restores eligibility for federal assistance if the Department of Justice (DOJ) determines that the jurisdiction no longer takes such actions.

 DOJ shall determine each year which state or local jurisdictions are ineligible for federal assistance under this bill and report such determinations to Congress.</summary>
