    "text": "Strengthening the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act This bill expands sanctions on goods produced or associated with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China. Current law applies a legal presumption that goods mined, manufactured, or produced in the XUAR or involving certain government-affiliated programs in the XUAR are derived from forced labor. Goods from these sources are prohibited from entering the United States unless the importer rebuts the presumption that forced labor was used. This bill broadens the scope of the sanctions by expanding the type of government-affiliated labor programs that trigger the presumption. Currently, the presumption generally applies to goods coming from entities working with Chinese government labor schemes that involve forced labor and target Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibetans, and other persecuted groups. Under this bill, the presumption applies when the entity works with any state-sponsored labor program targeting these persecuted groups. The bill also modifies the definition of forced labor to explicitly include state-imposed labor programs in China targeting Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibetans, and members of other persecuted groups. Additionally, the bill modifies the requirements for the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force's annual report to Congress. Specifically, the annual report must detail all presumptions applied and rebutted, as well as all companies known to have exported goods made in the XUAR."
