  <summary date="2024-08-22T20:39:13Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate data collection and sharing by the federal government during public health emergencies that involve infectious disease outbreaks or biological threats (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic).

In particular, the evaluation must (1) address various matters pertaining to the authorities, policies, and tools used to collect public health data from and share it with nonfederal governments, health care providers, and other partners; and (2) compare federal data collection, sharing, and modeling during the COVID-19 pandemic with similar activities carried out by nonfederal stakeholders.</summary>
