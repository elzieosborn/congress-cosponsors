Further, a state must require that a person from a covered foreign country that holds agricultural land in the state prior to the state law's enactment\u00a0submit an annual report to the state on the agricultural holdings.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture must submit a report to Congress on how the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 should be updated to ensure accurate documentation and monitoring of foreign investment in agricultural land.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must submit a report to Congress that includes (1) an assessment of this bill's impact on national security, and (2) any measures that can be taken to better secure\u00a0U.S. real estate from foreign manipulation.\u00a0"
