  <summary date="2023-12-05T12:09:15Z" status="Reported to House">Artificial Intelligence Accountability Act or the AI Accountability Act

This bill requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to study and report on accountability measures for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. (Generally, AI refers to computerized systems that work and react in ways commonly thought to require human intelligence, such as certain systems that solve complex problems in real-world situations.)

Specifically, the NTIA must study, solicit stakeholder feedback about, and report to Congress concerning mechanisms (e.g., audits, certifications, and assessments) to provide assurances that an AI system is trustworthy. Among other topics, the study, feedback, and report must address how the various accountability measures are currently incorporated into AI systems and how the measures may reduce risks related to AI systems.

In addition, the NTIA must consult with stakeholders through public meetings to develop recommendations about (1) the information that should be available to individuals, communities, and businesses that interact with, are affected by, or study AI systems; and (2) the methods for making that information available.</summary>
