This bill establishes a special disclosure rule relating to foreign sources associated with covered nations. Specifically, the bill requires an IHE to disclose any gift from or contract with a foreign source that is associated with a covered nation, regardless of the amount of the gift or contract.\n\nThe bill also directs ED to transmit disclosure reports and related records to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence."
