This bill establishes certain standards and requirements for guidance documents that are issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The bill specifies that CDC guidance documents may not create, restrict, or revoke any right of any person, may not be treated as having the force and effect of law, are not binding on the public or state or local agencies, and may not require an individual to take or refrain from an action. The bill also requires the CDC to develop guidance documents with input from the public, including with respect to emerging public health situations.

The CDC must post a list of all its guidance documents on its website and provide for an appeals process to address complaints about any violations of the bill's requirements.
