The bill also requires the CDC to develop guidance documents with input from the public, including with respect to emerging public health situations.\n\nThe CDC must post a list of all its guidance documents on its website and provide for an appeals process to address complaints about any violations of the bill's requirements.\n\n\u00a0"
