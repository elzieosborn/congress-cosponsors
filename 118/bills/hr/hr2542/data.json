    "text": "Infrastructure Expansion Act of 2023 \n\nThis bill precludes absolute liability in any action against a property owner or contractor for certain federal infrastructure and transportation development projects for any injury associated with an elevation- or gravity-related risk occurring on those projects. This applies to federally owned or operated projects and to projects receiving federal financial assistance for infrastructure and transportation development.\n\nIn any such claim, a state must apply a liability standard that considers the comparative negligence of the injured person when such negligence is a proximate cause of an injury, and state law would otherwise apply absolute liability as the basis for such claim.\n\nThe bill applies to claims arising from projects in which a state or local government accepts federal financial assistance beginning on or after January 1, 2025."
