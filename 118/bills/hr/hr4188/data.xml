  <summary date="2024-01-30T20:05:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Northern Border Regional Commission Reauthorization Act of 2023

This bill makes changes to the authorities and programs of regional economic and infrastructure development commissions.

Specifically, the bill reauthorizes the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) and establishes and expands NBRC grant programs. Regional commissions may make grants for the planning, construction, equipment, and operation of health, nutrition, and child care projects.

The bill also authorizes these regional commissions (as part of economic and infrastructure development grants) to promote the production of housing to meet economic development and workforce needs.

Each commission may accept transfers of funds from other federal agencies. Discretionary grants made by a commission to implement significant regional initiatives, to take advantage of special development opportunities, or to respond to emergency economic distress may be made without regard to specified percentage limitations. The bill limits the aggregate amount of discretionary grants.</summary>
