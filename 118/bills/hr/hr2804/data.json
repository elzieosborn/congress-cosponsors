    "text": "Harm Reduction Through Community Engagement Act of 2023\n\nThis bill requires opioid treatment programs to meet additional conditions related to community engagement, location, and other matters to be registered to dispense controlled substances for treating opioid use disorders.\n\nIn particular, treatment programs must engage with the surrounding community to address concerns and mitigate any negative impacts of the treatment program on the community. This includes establishing a community advisory board and implementing a community relations plan.\n\nAdditionally, treatment programs may not provide treatment services near specified locations frequented by children (e.g., elementary schools, day cares, and playgrounds) or another drug treatment facility or program.\n\nThe bill also requires treatment programs to actively promote the use of telehealth to minimize the need for in-person treatment."
