    "text": "Disability Access to Transportation Act\n\nThis bill establishes programs and requirements to expand transportation access for individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) must establish a one-stop paratransit pilot program. (Paratransit is often a service for the elderly and disabled using small buses and vans.) This program must develop or expand transit agency paratransit programs carried out pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to prevent long wait times between multiple trips that unduly limit an individual's ability to complete essential tasks.\n\nIn addition, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) must issue regulations to establish accessibility guidelines that set forth minimum standards for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way, including shared use paths.\n\nDOT must also implement procedures that allow an individual who believes that they have been subjected to discrimination on the basis of a disability by a public entity to submit an ADA complaint by phone, by mail-in form, and online. DOT must require each public transit provider and contractor providing paratransit services to post certain information on how an individual can file a disability-related complaint. In addition, DOT must publish yearly reports on the disposition of these accessibility complaints.\n\nFinally, DOT must create an accessibility data pilot program to provide data sets to states and metropolitan or rural planning organizations to\u00a0improve their transportation planning.\u00a0"
