This bill addresses freedom of association protections for college students in single-sex social organizations.

Specifically, the bill prohibits institutions of higher education that participate in federal student-aid programs from

 taking adverse actions against students who are members or prospective members of single-sex social organizations based solely on the practice of limiting membership to only individuals of one sex; or taking actions that require or coerce members or prospective members of such organizations to waive this prohibition, including as a condition of enrolling in the institution.</summary>
