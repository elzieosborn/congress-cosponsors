This bill increases the term of imprisonment for drug trafficking offenses involving large quantities of fentanyl or fentanyl analogues.

Specifically, the bill requires life imprisonment for illegally importing or exporting, or illegally manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, 400 grams or more of fentanyl or 100 grams or more of a fentanyl analogue, regardless of prior offenses or if death or serious bodily injury occurs. (Currently, such offenses carry a minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for a first offense; penalties increase with subsequent offenses or if death or serious bodily injury occurs.)</summary>
