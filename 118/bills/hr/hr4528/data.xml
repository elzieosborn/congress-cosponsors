This bill authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to address insufficient compensation of its personnel without regard to civil service laws. The NRC must consult with the Office of Personnel Management when making a determination of the appropriate compensation for its personnel.&#160;

It also allows the NRC to respond to a severe shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need for certain positions by using direct hiring to carry out the NRC's responsibilities and activities.&#160;
