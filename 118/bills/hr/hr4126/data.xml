This bill expands the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) to include grant coverage for current and future electric power requirements of public-use airports.

Specifically, this bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish a program and provide airport sponsors grants to&#160;conduct airport development to increase energy efficiency or meet future electrical power demands.

The bill also expands two definitions under the AIP to specify that (1) airport development includes an on-airport project to meet current and future electrical power demand, and (2) airport planning includes assessing current and future electrical power demand.

The FAA may also establish an AIP pilot program to provide funding for electric aircraft infrastructure. Up to 10 public-use airports may be eligible for grants to carry out (1) the acquisition, operation, and installation of equipment to support electric aircraft operations; and (2) the construction or modification of infrastructure for power delivery or services for electric aircraft.&#160;</summary>
