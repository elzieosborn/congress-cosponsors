  <summary date="2024-07-18T12:34:07Z" status="Passed House">This bill suspends the tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations. The bill defines terrorist supporting organization as any organization designated as having provided (during the three-year period prior to its designation) material support or resources to a terrorist organization in excess of a de minimis amount.

The Department of the Treasury must provide notice to such organizations of the impending designation and an opportunity to cure. Treasury must rescind a designation that it determines was erroneous or if the organization did not receive notice of designation.&#160;

The bill provides for administrative review by the Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of Appeals of any dispute regarding a designation of an organization as a terrorist supporting organization. The U.S. district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review any such designation.&#160;</summary>
