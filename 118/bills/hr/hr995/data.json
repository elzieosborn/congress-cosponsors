DOE must also study the global status of the civilian nuclear energy industry and its supply chain.\n\nIn addition, the bill prohibits any person from possessing or owning enriched uranium from Russian or China unless specifically authorized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). NRC may not issue a license to possess or own such fuel if DOE and the Department of State determine that the possession or ownership would pose a threat to national security.\n\nNRC must establish an International Nuclear Reactor Export and Innovation Branch within its Office of International Programs to carry out and coordinate certain nuclear reactor export and innovation activities. NRC must also identify in its annual budget justification such activities."
