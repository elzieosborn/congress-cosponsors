Specifically, the VA must furnish such care to an eligible veteran if it determines (1) the hospital care or medical services are consistent with the standard medical practice in the United States, and (2) any prescription medication furnished is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFor any care provided abroad, the VA must ensure (1) reimbursements made to veterans and medical providers can be made by direct deposit; and (2) the VA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile applications provide for digital submission, real-time tracking of required forms, and the availability of specified documents associated with care or services, such as a benefits authorization letter."
