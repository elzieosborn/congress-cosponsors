This bill establishes a National Digital Reserve Corps in the General Services Administration (GSA) to address the digital and cybersecurity needs of executive agencies.

The GSA must establish standards for reservist eligibility and must ensure reservists have the necessary resources and security credentials for service. Reservists must agree to serve for three years and for at least 30 days per year as an active reservist, with up to $10,000 in annual compensation; reservists who fail to accept an offered appointment or complete required duties are subject to fines. The GSA may cover the costs of continuing education for reservists to support their service.

The Department of Labor must issue regulations that ensure the reemployment, continuation of benefits, and nondiscrimination in reemployment of active reservists.

In August 2021, President Joe Biden established the U.S. Digital Corps within the GSA to support the technological needs of executive agencies, including cybersecurity needs. The corps offers entry-level positions through two-year fellowships, with the option to convert to full-time career positions after completion of the fellowship.</summary>
