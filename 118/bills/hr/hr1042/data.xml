  <summary date="2024-06-05T11:34:52Z" status="Public Law">This bill limits the importation of uranium from Russia.

Specifically, it bans unirradiated low-enriched uranium (i.e., uranium that has not been in a reactor) that is produced in Russia or by a Russian entity from being imported into the United States. The bill also prohibits the importation of unirradiated low-enriched uranium that has been swapped for the banned uranium or otherwise obtained in a manner designed to circumvent the ban's restrictions.

However, the Department of Energy (DOE) may waive this ban if DOE determines that (1) no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a U.S. nuclear energy company, or (2) importation of the uranium is in the national interest. Any waiver issued must terminate by January 1, 2028. The ban terminates on December 31, 2040. &#160;</summary>
