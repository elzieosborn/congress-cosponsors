  <summary date="2025-01-24T19:41:58Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to take any actions that may be necessary to implement the Government Accountability Office&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s (GAO&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s) priority recommendations within the report titled Disaster Recovery: Actions Needed to Improve the Federal Approach, which was published on November 15, 2022. In the report, the GAO recommends that FEMA and HUD better manage fragmentation between their disaster recovery programs and other federal programs, and that FEMA better manage fragmentation across FEMA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s own disaster recovery programs. &#160;</summary>
