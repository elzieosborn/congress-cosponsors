  <summary date="2024-07-19T17:41:08Z" status="Reported to House">Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act of 2023

This bill, in the event of a threat to U.S. interests by China, (1) requires additional reporting on the domestic and foreign financial activity of specified Chinese officials, and (2) prohibits certain financial transactions with specified Chinese officials.

Upon a determination by the President that such a threat exists, the bill requires the Department of the Treasury to (1) report to Congress on funds held by certain members of the Chinese Communist Party, including the total amount of funds, a description of the funds, and a list of related financial institutions; and (2) brief Congress on how these funds were acquired and any illicit or corrupt means employed to acquire or use the funds.

After such a report is made, Treasury must prohibit significant transactions between U.S. financial institutions and these individuals (and their immediate family, if appropriate). The bill provides exceptions for intelligence, law enforcement, and national security activities. The President may waive the prohibition under certain circumstances.</summary>
