The allocations are provided under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and are often referred to as 302(a) allocations.\n\nThe bill applies to programs included in the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) annual report listing programs that are funded through the appropriations process and have an authorization of appropriations that has either expired or will expire during the year.\u00a0\n\nIf a program is listed in the\u00a0CBO report, the bill requires specified reductions to be implemented over a three-year period and terminates the unauthorized programs at the end of the third unauthorized year.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
