This bill addresses various Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issues, including the family caregiver program and VA facility security.

Specifically, the bill authorizes the VA to award grants to implement, coordinate, improve, or enhance mental health counseling, treatment, or support for family caregivers of veterans participating in the family caregiver program.

The bill also authorizes the VA to make contributions to local authorities to mitigate the risk of flooding on local property adjacent to VA medical facilities.

Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on the provision of mental health support to caregivers of veterans.

The bill also requires the VA to annually survey its police chiefs, facility emergency management leaders, facility directors, or individuals acting in such a capacity to collect information regarding security at VA facilities.

Finally, the bill extends certain loan fee rates through March 12, 2032, under the VA's home loan program.</summary>
