This bill prohibits federally funded programs or activities from being premised on certain principles relating to race or sex.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the use of federal funds for programs or activities that are premised on principles such as that (1) one race or sex is inherently superior to another, (2) the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist, and (3) an individual bears responsibility for the past actions of others of the same race or sex.

The bill includes the use of these principles as a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities.</summary>
