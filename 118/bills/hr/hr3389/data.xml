  <summary date="2023-12-26T15:24:20Z" status="Passed House">Emergency Wildfire Fighting Technology Act of 2023

This bill requires the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to jointly evaluate the container aerial firefighting system to assess its use to mitigate and suppress wildfires and report to Congress.

The system allows for the use of airdrop-capable disposable containers of water or fire retardant, which increases the number of airlift assets available for wildfire emergencies.</summary>
