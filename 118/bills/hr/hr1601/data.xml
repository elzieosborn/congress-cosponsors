This bill extends the ban on lobbying that applies to former Members of Congress.

Specifically, the bill imposes a six-year ban for former Senators and a three-year ban for former Representatives; a ban begins once a former Senator or Representative leaves office. Under current law, former Senators are subject to a two-year ban, while former House Members are subject to a one-year ban.</summary>
