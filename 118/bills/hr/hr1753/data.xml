  <summary date="2024-02-27T18:05:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the military departments to ensure that certain military service in a female cultural support team is included in an individual's military service record and in the computation of retired pay. Specifically, the bill addresses service of a member of the Armed Forces who served in a female cultural support team (with the personal development skill identifier of R2J or 5DK) from January 1, 2010, through August 31, 2021.

The bill provides that individuals who performed such service (or their survivors) who have previously had a claim for service-connection denied may resubmit a claim for the same condition to be considered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). For purposes of claims for service-connected disability or death, the VA must treat such service as engagement in combat with the enemy in the course of active duty. The VA must determine the effective date of the award by treating the date of the initial claim as the date on which the individual filed the awarded claim.

The VA must also improve training and guidance for employees who may process claims for service-connected disability and death for individuals who served in a female cultural support team.

Finally, the VA must conduct outreach to inform individuals who performed such service (or survivors of such individuals) that they may submit supplemental claims for service-connected disability or death incurred or aggravated in the course of service.</summary>
