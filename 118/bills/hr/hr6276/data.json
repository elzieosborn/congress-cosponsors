Federal agencies must (1) work with GSA to use sensors and other technologies in public buildings to measure occupancy, and (2) report on actual space utilization.\n\nOMB and GSA must annually ensure building utilization averages at least 60% in each public building and federally leased space over each 1-year period. The bill also requires OMB and GSA to submit a plan to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to consolidate federal agency headquarters buildings in the National Capital region so that building utilization exceeds 60%.\n\nOccupancy agreements between federal tenants and the GSA shall stipulate annual reporting to GSA on space utilization and occupancy. Federal tenants must return office space to GSA if the occupancy of the tenant falls below a 60% space utilization rate for six months within any 1-year period. Agencies with independent leasing authorities must report space utilization and occupancy annually to Congress.\n\nThe GAO shall report on agency costs and occupancy rates for public or federally leased buildings.\n\nAgencies must report certain buildings with utilization rates below 20% to the agency's inspector general for investigation."
