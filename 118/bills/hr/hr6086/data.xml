This bill requires the results of student academic assessments to be disaggregated within each state, local educational agency, and school by Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander subgroups.

In particular, the Asian American category must include Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, Thai, Taiwanese, Burmese, Bangladeshi, and Nepalese subgroups, and, to the greatest extent practicable, additional subgroups such as the lu Mien and Montagnards. The Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander category must include Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Chamorro, Tongan, iTaukei, and Marshallese, and, to the greatest extent practicable, additional subgroups such as the Chuukese and Palauan.

The Department of Education must develop guidance related to whether and when these reporting requirements will yield statistically reliable information. Such guidance shall help to inform the minimum number of students that will maximize data reporting for each major racial and ethnic group.</summary>
