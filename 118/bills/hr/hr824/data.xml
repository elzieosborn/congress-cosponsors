  <summary date="2023-11-07T22:28:36Z" status="Reported to House, Part I">Telehealth Benefit Expansion for Workers Act of 2023

This bill allows employers to offer stand-alone telehealth benefits to all employees. This includes employees who are eligible for enrollment in their employer's group health plan.

Such stand-alone plans must comply with certain patient protections, including the prohibitions against (1) exclusion from coverage based on a preexisting condition, (2) discrimination based on health status, and (3) rescission of coverage.

Currently, employers may offer telehealth benefits to employees who are otherwise ineligible for the employer's group health plan. This flexibility applies during any plan year beginning before the end of the COVID-19 emergency.</summary>
