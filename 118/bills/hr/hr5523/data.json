The additional requirement is to provide examples of improvement in each country in preventing narcotics-related money laundering, where such information is available.\n\nThe President shall also consult with the Department of the Treasury on parts of the report related to money laundering and provide each country identified as a major money laundering country an opportunity to provide comments on the draft report.\n\nThe bill also requires Treasury to consult with Federal banking agencies, the Financial Institutions Examination Council, and the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group and report to Congress on how to build more consistent Bank Secrecy Act exams across those agencies."
