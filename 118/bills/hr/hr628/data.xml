  <summary date="2023-06-01T15:12:41Z" status="Introduced in House">South Florida Ecosystem Enhancement Act of 2023

This bill provides support for ecosystems in South Florida. Under the bill, South Florida means (1) land and water within the administrative boundaries of the South Florida Water Management District and contiguous near-shore coastal waters, including the Florida Keys; and (2) Florida's Coral Reef and the associated patch reef, hard-bottom, and seagrass resources.

Specifically, the bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a South Florida Program within the Water Division of its Region 4 Office. Under the program, the EPA must (1) assess trends in water quality, (2) assess data to identify existing or potential water quality problems and the causes of those problems, and (3) award grants to carry out ecosystem and educational programs established by this bill.

In addition, the EPA must annually develop and execute interagency agreements or cooperative agreements with federal, state, local, and tribal entities. Those agreements must provide funding for one or more special projects or activities within South Florida on the recommendation of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force.</summary>
