    "text": "National Security Reforms and Accountability Act\n\nThis bill limits presidential authorities related to, and increases congressional oversight of, introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities, arms transactions, and national emergencies.\n\nThe bill makes various changes to the War Powers Resolution, which provides procedures for Congress and the President to participate in decisions to send U.S. forces into hostilities. These changes include requiring specific statutory authorization for, and revising congressional procedures to approve or disapprove of, the introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities. The bill also prohibits the use of federal funds for any activity of U.S. forces that lacks the required authorization.\n\nThe President must also seek congressional approval before entering, renewing, or extending an arms sale or related transaction if the transaction exceeds specified dollar thresholds. This does not apply to transactions with NATO and its member countries, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Israel, New Zealand, or Taiwan. The bill also prohibits transfers of defense articles and services to countries that commit genocide or otherwise violate international humanitarian law.\n\nThe bill restricts presidential authorities related to national emergencies, including by limiting the period of a declared emergency to 30 days unless Congress authorizes an extension. The bill also establishes procedures for approving or disapproving an extension, requires the President to provide more detailed reports to Congress about national emergencies, and sets out specific provisions for terminating an emergency."
