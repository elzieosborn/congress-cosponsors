This bill allows federal agencies to disclose such records to CBO (or to an authorized representative of CBO) without obtaining the prior written consent of the individual.\n\nSeveral agencies, including the Government Accountability Office and the National Archives and Records Administration, are currently exempt from these requirements, and this bill adds CBO to the list of exemptions."
