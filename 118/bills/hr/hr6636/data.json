    "text": "Woman's Right To Know Act\n\nThis bill requires health care providers to perform an ultrasound and obtain certain informed consent before performing an abortion procedure.\n\nSpecifically, before performing an abortion, providers must first perform an ultrasound and share the results with the woman, and also present the woman with an authorization form at least 24 hours before performing the abortion procedure. The form must (1) include specified information concerning gestational age, associated developmental characteristics,\u00a0and medical risks; (2) include a statement that an ultrasound has been performed and the results were shared with the woman; (3) disclose penalties\u00a0that\u00a0providers may face for failing to comply with the bill's requirements; and (4) include an affirmation that the individual signing the form understands the information. The form must be signed and witnessed in person and retained in the medical file.\n\nThe bill's requirements do not apply if, in reasonable medical judgment, compliance would pose a greater risk of death or substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function, excluding psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant woman.\n\nThe bill also establishes civil penalties for providers who do not comply with these requirements."
