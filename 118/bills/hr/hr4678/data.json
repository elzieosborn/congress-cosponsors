The FAA, the NRC, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Department of Energy must collaborate to establish these procedures to deploy microreactors\u00a0as soon as practicable.\u00a0\n\nAfter these procedures are finalized, the FAA must update the agency's guidance to consider the use of\u00a0microreactors in airport emergency plans. Further, the FAA must update the airport emergency plan requirements\u00a0to encourage certified airports to consider utilizing\u00a0microreactors to provide backup power in the case of an emergency event that results in a primary power source disruption.\u00a0"
