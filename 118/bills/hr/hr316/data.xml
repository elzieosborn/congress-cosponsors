This bill requires various federal agencies to develop a strategy to improve coordination with state and local law enforcement entities to address organized retail crime.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and other relevant agencies to

 improve federal information sharing about organized retail crime networks; assist state and local law enforcement in compiling materials and evidence necessary to prosecute organized retail crime; and increase cooperation and information sharing between federal agencies, the retail industry, and retail crime task forces. The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to report on coordination between the private sector and law enforcement to deter and investigate organized retail crime.</summary>
