The corporation may award the loan or loan agreement after such period unless Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the application with an explanation for such disapproval. An application that addresses the basis for the disapproval may be resubmitted to the corporation.\n\nEvery five years, the Government Accountability Office must evaluate the activities of the corporation from the previous five fiscal years and submit a report to Congress."
