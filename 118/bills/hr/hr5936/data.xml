This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) to take certain actions to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities.

Specifically, the bill requires an IHE to designate at least one employee to coordinate compliance with federal civil rights.

In addition, an IHE must (1) annually submit to the Department of Education a report that includes all complaints alleging discrimination and make such report publicly available; and (2) provide students and employees with the contact information of the designated employee, the report, the enforcement policies of the IHE, and the procedures for reporting and investigating complaints.</summary>
