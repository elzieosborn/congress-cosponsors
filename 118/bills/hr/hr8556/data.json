(In a declaratory ruling titled Modernizing the E-Rate Program for Schools and Libraries and released on October 25, 2023, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) declared that the use of Wi-Fi and similar technologies on school buses serves an educational purpose and is therefore eligible for E-Rate funding. The policy effectively permits schools to receive discounted telecommunications service for use on school buses.)\n\nThe bill also directs the FCC to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking specifying any additional locations for which E-Rate funding may be used to support connectivity. The FCC must establish an annual process for considering additional eligible locations.\u00a0"
