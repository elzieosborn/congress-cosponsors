Nonfederal warrant refers to a warrant authorizing a search by a state or local law enforcement agency or office executing an ex parte judicial order to confiscate a firearm.\n\nThe bill permits a federal law enforcement officer to forcibly enter a location subject to a warrant, in less than 30 seconds, if there is a threat or risk of serious, imminent life-threatening injury and the officer submits a formal written report to the judicial official responsible for authorizing the warrant."
