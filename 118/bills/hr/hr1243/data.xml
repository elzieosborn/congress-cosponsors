This bill generally prohibits any federal law enforcement officer or individual employed by a federal law enforcement agency from providing financial or material aid in support of executing a nonfederal warrant requested by a state or local law enforcement agency. Nonfederal warrant refers to a warrant authorizing a search by a state or local law enforcement agency or office executing an ex parte judicial order to confiscate a firearm.

The bill permits a federal law enforcement officer to forcibly enter a location subject to a warrant, in less than 30 seconds, if there is a threat or risk of serious, imminent life-threatening injury and the officer submits a formal written report to the judicial official responsible for authorizing the warrant.</summary>
