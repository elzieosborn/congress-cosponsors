Additionally, the VA must appoint an individual as acting director not later than 120 days after detailing a director to a different position.\n\nThe VA must regularly update Congress regarding the status of the detail.\n\nGenerally, not later than 180 days after detailing a director to a different position, the VA must return the individual to the position as director or reassign the individual from the position and begin the process of hiring a new director. This requirement may be waived for a limited amount of time, but the VA must submit to Congress a justification for the waiver."
