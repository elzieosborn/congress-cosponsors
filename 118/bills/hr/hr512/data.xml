This bill prohibits the Election Assistance Commission from making payments to any state or jurisdiction unless the state or jurisdiction certifies that it meets certain election standards.

Specifically, the state or jurisdiction must certify that it

 requires a photo identification for voting, restricts the delivery of ballots by third parties (i.e., prohibits ballot harvesting), prohibits the use of a drop box for collecting a voted ballot unless it is located at the office of an election official, does not deliver an absentee or other mail-in ballot to any individual who does not request the delivery of such a ballot, and does not allow noncitizens to vote in any election.</summary>
