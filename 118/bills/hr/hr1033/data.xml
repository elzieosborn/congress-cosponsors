  <summary date="2023-06-04T19:51:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2023 

This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a visa waiver program for nationals of certain countries to enter the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Specifically, the bill expands an existing program that authorizes visa waivers for nationals of certain countries to enter Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands to also authorize waivers for entry to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under this program, DHS may provide a waiver admitting a nonimmigrant visitor for up to 45 days if the waiver does not represent a threat to the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its territories or commonwealths.</summary>
