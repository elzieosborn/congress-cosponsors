This bill generally prohibits an institution of higher education (IHE) that hosts a Confucius Institute from receiving funding from the Department of Defense (DOD). A Confucius Institute is a cultural institute directly or indirectly funded by the Chinese government.

Currently, a U.S. IHE that hosts a Confucius Institute is prohibited from receiving DOD funds (except for funds provided directly to students as educational assistance) unless that IHE receives a waiver from DOD. This bill removes DOD's waiver authority.

The bill also applies the general prohibition to international IHEs.</summary>
