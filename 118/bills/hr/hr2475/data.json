Makerspaces are community spaces that provide learners and entrepreneurs with tools, technology, and knowledge for prototyping or creating physical goods and support educational opportunities for personal growth, workforce training, and early-stage business ventures.\n\nWhen awarding the grants, the NSF must prioritize certain recipients, including (1) community colleges and minority-serving institutions; and (2) those that partner with workforce development entities, high-need local educational agencies, or independent nonprofit or academic makerspaces."
