The bill allows for the continued use of the areas by members of Indian tribes for traditional ceremonies and as a source of traditional plants and other materials.\n\nThe Department of the Interior shall establish the Dolores River National Conservation Area Advisory Council.\n\nInterior must manage the areas identified as Ponderosa Gorge in a manner that maintains its wilderness character, including certain restrictions on (1) road construction; (2) the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, or mechanical transport; and (3) projects undertaken for the purpose of harvesting commercial timber.\n\nThe bill releases segments of the Dolores River inside the areas from further study for potential addition to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System."
