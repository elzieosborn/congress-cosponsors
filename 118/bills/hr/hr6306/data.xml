  <summary date="2024-03-18T14:25:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Embassy Construction Integrity Act of 2023

This bill prohibits the Department of State from acquiring or leasing certain buildings for use as a consular or diplomatic post outside of the United States, with a focus on restrictions against buildings owned by entities controlled by the Chinese government.

The restrictions in this bill apply to certain entities affiliated with the Chinese government, generally those controlled or owned (at least a 25% stake) by the Chinese government or its agents.

The State Department may not acquire or lease a building for a consular or diplomatic post if (1) the building is owned in whole or in part by an entity affiliated with the Chinese government, or (2) such an entity has performed construction or maintenance on the building at any time after 1948.

The bill also prohibits the State Department from allowing such an entity to perform construction or maintenance on any building that functions as a consular or diplomatic post.</summary>
