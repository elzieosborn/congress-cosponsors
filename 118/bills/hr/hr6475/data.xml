  <summary date="2024-01-24T23:07:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Disparity Zones Act of 2023

This bill provides for the designation of Health Disparity Zones in certain geographic areas with documented and measurable health disparities. This designation, which expires 10 fiscal years after the bill's enactment, confers eligibility for certain grants, student loan repayment programs, and tax credits for those working to reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes in these zones.

Specifically, community-based nonprofits or local government agencies, in coalition with health care providers, social service organizations, and others, may apply to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the designation. The application must include a plan to reduce health disparities and achieve other outcomes.

In implementing the program, HHS must consult with, among others, the Department of Housing and Urban Development. When approving applications, HHS shall consider factors including geographic diversity and the commitment of supporting funds from the private sector. HHS (1) may award grants to organizations or agencies that applied for the designation to support activities aligned with their plans, and (2) must carry out a student loan repayment program for health care providers who agree to provide services in a Health Disparity Zone.

In addition, the bill establishes tax credits for employers that hire, and individuals who work as, Health Disparity Zone workers.</summary>
