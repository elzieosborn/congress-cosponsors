This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deny an application for immigration benefits from certain individuals with connections to the Chinese government in certain instances, including if the applicant has made anti-capitalist public statements.

Specifically, this bill applies to any non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) who is applying for immigration status based on the individual's relationship with (1) an employer or institution of higher education that receives funding from the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or (2) an immediate family relation that is associated with the Chinese government or the CCP.

For an application from such an individual, DHS must review for certain factors, including whether the individual has (1) been employed by the CCP or the Chinese government, (2) received any grants from the CCP or the Chinese government, (3) made any anti-capitalist or anti-American public statements, or (4) received any payments or reimbursements from the CCP or the Chinese government. If DHS determines that any such factors apply to the individual, DHS must deny the individual's application for an immigration benefit.

 If an individual lies on an application that is subject to review for these factors, that individual shall be subject to deportation and a fine of $5,000.</summary>
