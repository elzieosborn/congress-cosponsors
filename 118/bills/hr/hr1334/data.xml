This bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish standards to ensure the safety and security of federally assisted housing in high-crime areas. Public housing agencies serving high-crime areas must also establish anonymous hotlines for tenants to report suspicious activity and crimes in the community. In addition, HUD must prioritize public housing projects located in high-crime areas when awarding certain public housing grants for safety and security measures.

Under the bill, a high-crime area is designated by HUD based on the most recent violent crime data available.</summary>
