The TCPA prohibits certain telemarketing calls made without the recipient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consent and using automatic dialing technology or artificial and prerecorded voice messages.\u00a0\n\nUnder current law, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has authority to pursue unpaid fines for violations of the TCPA. Under the bill, if DOJ does not pursue an unpaid fine within a specified time period, the FCC may do so. The bill directs the FCC to prioritize the collection of unpaid fines over $25 million.\u00a0"
