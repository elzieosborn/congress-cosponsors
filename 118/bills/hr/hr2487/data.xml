  <summary date="2023-09-27T17:25:43Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits federal funds from being used to carry out the Green Power Partnership unless the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) includes nuclear power as a green source of energy when determining whether a program participant meets the partnership's requirements concerning electricity usage. The Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that encourages organizations to use green power in order to reduce environmental impacts associated with electricity use. In return for technical assistance and recognition, the partners commit to use green power for all, or a portion, of their annual electricity consumption.</summary>
