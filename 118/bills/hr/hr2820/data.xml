  <summary date="2023-06-07T13:09:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice for Jana Elementary Act of 2023

This bill establishes a program and requirements regarding schools impacted by radioactive contaminants, including in the Hazelwood School District in Missouri.

Specifically, the bill requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to establish and execute new remediation goals for Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District so that no portion of the site is subjected to radiation above background levels. (The school is located near Coldwater Creek, which is contaminated with radioactive waste from nearby sites used for the World War II nuclear weapons program.)

The bill establishes a Radioactive School Assistance Program (and fund) to provide financial assistance to local educational agencies that have been financially impacted by the presence of radioactive contaminants stemming from U.S. atomic energy activities.

Under the bill, schools in the Hazelwood School District in Missouri must be designated as vicinity properties of the St. Louis Airport Site for purposes of the USACE Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. Such schools must be investigated, including via on-site inspections and sampling, in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the National Contingency Plan (i.e., the national plan for responding to spills or releases of hazardous substances).

The Department of Energy must review and report on the methodology and results of all tests for radioactive contaminants conducted at Jana Elementary School.</summary>
