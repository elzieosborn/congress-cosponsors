The Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs must establish a hotline and investigate complaints alleging that a federal contractor is utilizing such training programs in violation of the contractor's obligations.\n\nAll federal agencies must review their grant programs and identify programs for which the agency may, as a condition of receiving a grant, require the recipient to certify that it will not use federal funds to promote certain concepts that include race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating.\n\nThe bill requires the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget to take specified actions regarding review of agency training.\n\nThe Department of Justice should continue to assess the extent to which workplace training that teaches race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating may contribute to a hostile work environment and give rise to potential liability under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe bill prohibits obligating or expending federal funds to carry out specified executive orders related to diversity, equity, and inclusion."
