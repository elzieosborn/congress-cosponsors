(Currently, the Architect is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.)\n\nThe bill also provides for the Deputy Architect to serve as acting Architect in the event the Architect is absent, disabled, or otherwise unavailable.\n\nIf the Architect fails to appoint a Deputy Architect within a set time frame, the commission must do so. Additionally, in the event of vacancies in both the Architect and Deputy Architect positions, the commission must appoint an acting Architect."
