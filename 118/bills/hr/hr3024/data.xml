  <summary date="2023-10-17T21:33:52Z" status="Introduced in House">Life Saving Leave Act

This bill expands employee medical leave to provide additional time for bone marrow or blood stem cell donations.

Specifically, the bill expands leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) to provide up to 40 hours of leave every 12 months for related predonation, donation, and postdonation activities. Under the bill, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. An employee has the option to substitute accrued paid vacation, personal, or sick leave for the unpaid FMLA time.

The bill requires an employee to make a reasonable effort to schedule treatments for when the treatment would not unduly disrupt the employer's activities.

Eligible employees may use this leave regardless of the employee's length of employment or the size of the employer.</summary>
