    "text": "This bill requires schools to substitute a nondairy beverage for fluid milk in the National School Lunch Program upon the request of a student or their parent or guardian. Under current law, schools participating in the program may provide a substitute at the request of a medical authority or the student's parent or guardian.\n\nThe bill also removes current requirements that (1) the substitute request be based on an identified medical or other special dietary need that restricts the student's diet, and (2) the school food authority pay for any additional expenses resulting from providing the substitute that exceed the covered reimbursement amounts."
