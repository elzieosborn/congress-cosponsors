This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a program to support microchipping of dogs and cats in the care of pounds or shelters. Under the program, USDA must enter into cooperative agreements with state and local governments to support the capability of pounds or shelters to provide for microchipping of dogs and cats in their care before allowing them to be recovered by their owners, adopted by other individuals, or transferred to another shelter or rescue organization.</summary>
