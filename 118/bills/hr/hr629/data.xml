This bill authorizes states to approve their own experimental, pilot, or demonstration project under Medicaid if the project provides certain benefits involving electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards. (Currently, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services approves Medicaid demonstration projects; such projects are also known as Section 1115 Demonstrations.)

Specifically, the project must provide enrollees who elect to participate with an EBT card to purchase primary care services; enrollees must receive any remaining balance at the end of the year in the form of a cash payment and must also obtain catastrophic health insurance.</summary>
