Further, the bill nullifies this executive order to the extent that it is inconsistent with Section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (relating to voter registration agencies).\n\nThe bill also prohibits institutions of higher education that operate federal work-study programs from registering or mobilizing voters on or off campus. \u00a0"
