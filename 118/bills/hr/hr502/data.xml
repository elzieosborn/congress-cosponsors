  <summary date="2023-03-13T15:38:14Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill modifies the process for repaying service members and veterans who paid to keep benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill, but later chose to utilize Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Specifically, the bill removes the requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to issue the repayments with the last monthly housing stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This requirement has limited the repayments to individuals who are receiving stipends. Under the bill, the VA must make such a repayment before the exhaustion of the individual's entitlement to education assistance.</summary>
