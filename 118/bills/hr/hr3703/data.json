(Medical countermeasures are certain medical products that may be used to diagnose, prevent, or treat conditions associated with chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats or emerging infectious diseases during public health emergencies.)\n\nThe review must address, among other topics, efforts to transition to new initiatives for facilitating the development and manufacturing of countermeasures (e.g., transitioning from the Centers for Innovation and Advanced Drug Manufacturing program to Industrial Base Expansion Connect)."
