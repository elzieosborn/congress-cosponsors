    "text": "Easy Access to Mail Act\n\nThis bill establishes procedures for the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) regarding the use of centralized delivery of the mail with respect to residential housing units.\n\nSpecifically, the bill\n\n provides that, for any housing development with respect to which the primary mode of mail delivery is any such mode except for centralized delivery on the date of this bill's enactment, the USPS may not change such mode of delivery to centralized delivery; and prohibits the USPS from requiring centralized delivery with respect to any housing development constructed after this bill's enactment without prior approval from the local legislative body, or, in the absence of a local legislative body, the legislature of the state with jurisdiction over the affected property. If approval for centralized delivery is granted, at least 60 days before commencing such delivery the local postmaster shall provide (1) written notice to any other units of local government and any planning commissions located within the applicable county; and (2) a period of 60 days for public comment from residents, property owners, and home builders within such county regarding the use of centralized delivery at the applicable housing development.\n\nThe Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure that the USPS does not change any USPS policy in effect on the date of enactment that would result in a disproportionate negative affect on rural, lower income, elderly, disabled, or predominately minority communities."
