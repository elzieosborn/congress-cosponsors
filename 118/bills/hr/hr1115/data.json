    "text": "Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act\n\nThis bill expands the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)to act as the only lead agency for the purpose of coordinating the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) of natural gas pipeline project applications under the Natural Gas Act. Thus, federal, state, and local agencies involved in the environmental review process must defer to FERC's approved scope for a NEPA review.\n\nFERC must invite and designate the other participating agencies involved in the authorization process by deadlines established by the bill. In addition, FERC must consult with the Transportation Security Administration regarding pipeline infrastructure security, pipeline cybersecurity, pipeline personnel security, and other pipeline security measures.\n\nThe bill establishes a deadline for agencies to complete NEPA reviews of pipeline projects and requires concurrent reviews when multiple federal or state agencies are involved.\n\nApplicants for gas pipeline projects do not have to obtain a certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Instead, FERC must incorporate the water quality certification into its NEPA review.\n\nIf a federal or state agency requires the person applying for a pipeline authorization to submit data, the agency must consider any such data gathered by aerial or other remote means that the person submits."
