This bill prohibits U.S. foreign assistance from being dispersed to a country that refuses or unreasonably delays the acceptance of a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) who (1) is a citizen or resident of that country, and (2) has received a final order of removal from the United States. Additionally, the bill prohibits visas from being issued to residents of such a country.

The bill provides standing for a victim or immediate family member of a victim of a crime committed by a non-U.S. national who has received a final order of removal to enforce these sanctions in federal court.</summary>
