This bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to establish a task force to study and report on the impact of automated accounts on social media, public discourse, and elections.

Specifically, the study must assess (1) what qualifies as a bot or automated account; (2) the extent to which automated accounts are used; (3) how automated accounts are used; and&#160;(4) how to most effectively combat any use of automated accounts that negatively effects social media, public discourse, and elections while continuing to promote the protection of the First Amendment.

The&#160;task force must provide Congress and relevant federal agencies with the results and conclusions of its study within one year after the task force is established.&#160;</summary>
