    "text": "Michael F. Donoughe Tax Credit for Off Road Electric Vehicles Act \n\nThis bill expands the clean vehicle tax credit to include new qualified off-road plug-in electric vehicles. The amount of the tax credit allowed for a new qualified off-road plug-in electric vehicle is 10% of the cost of the vehicle or $2,500,\u00a0whichever is lower.\n\nThe bill defines a new qualified off-road plug-in electric vehicle as any vehicle that\n\nis acquired new and for use by the taxpayer;is made by a qualified manufacturer;is powered by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery with a capacity of at least six\u00a0 kilowatt hours;has final assembly occurring in North America;has a dry weight of less than 3,500 pounds;has three or more wheels;has one or more seats;is manufactured primarily for off-road use;is designed for use on rough terrain\u00a0and, except in the case of a vehicle designed to operate on land and water, is not designed to operate on rails, in the air, or in or on the water; andis capable of reaching a speed of 40 miles per hour.Under current law, a qualified manufacturer is any manufacturer that has a written agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and submits reports containing information about each eligible clean vehicle.\n\nFinally, the bill allows the tax credit for a new qualified off-road plug-in electric vehicle to be transferred from the taxpayer to an eligible entity (e.g., vehicle dealer) in exchange for a financial benefit (e.g., rebate)."
