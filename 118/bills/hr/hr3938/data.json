    "text": "Build It in America Act \n\nThis bill provides for tax incentives to encourage investment in the United States.\n\nThe bill permits the expensing of research and experimental expenditures (including software development costs) through 2025. It extends (1) the allowance for depreciation, amortization, or depletion in determining the limitation on business interest; and (2) the 100% bonus depreciation allowance.\n\nThe bill terminates the hazardous substance Superfund financing rate. It allows a taxpayer election to disregard specified regulations when determining if any tax is an income, war profits, or excess profits tax.\n\nThe bill imposes a 60% excise tax on buyers of U.S. farmland by citizens of a country of concern (e.g., a state supporter of terrorism) or by a private business entity that is 10% or more owned by a citizen or business entity domiciled in a country of concern.\n\nThe bill repeals the clean electricity production tax credit, the clean electricity investment tax credit, the tax credit for previously owned clean vehicles, and the tax credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles. It modifies provisions of the clean vehicle tax credit, including those relating to the base amount and battery capacity."
