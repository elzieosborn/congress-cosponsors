This bill requires the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service to each establish an online portal for processing communications use authorizations. These are requests for easements, rights-of-way, leases, licenses, or other authorizations to locate or modify a transmitting device, support structure, or other communications facility on public lands or National Forest System land.

Interior and the Forest Service must also notify the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) within three business days of establishing their respective portals, and once the portals are established, the NTIA must link to them from its website.</summary>
