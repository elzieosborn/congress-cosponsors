  <summary date="2023-10-03T16:34:46Z" status="Introduced in House">Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2023

This bill establishes requirements to research and control the fungus Ceratocystis, known as Rapid Ohia Death, which has killed more than a million native trees in Hawaii.

 Specifically, the Department of the Interior must partner with the Department of Agriculture and Hawaii to control and address the fungus.

In addition, the U.S. Geological Survey must continue to research Rapid Ohia Death vectors and transmission.

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must continue to partner with Hawaii and local stakeholders to manage ungulates (e.g., certain mammals such as deer) in Rapid Ohia Death control areas on federal, state, and private land.

Finally, the Forest Service must continue to provide (1) financial assistance to prevent the spread of the fungus and to restore the native forests of Hawaii, and (2) staff and necessary infrastructure funding to the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry to research the fungus.</summary>
