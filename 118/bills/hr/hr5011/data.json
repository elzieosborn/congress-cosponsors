It also eliminates the limitation on the amount that may be deferred.\n\n The Department of the Treasury must establish the S Corporation Employee Ownership Assistance Office to foster increased employee ownership of S corporations. The office must provide education and outreach about the benefits of employee ownership of S corporations and technical assistance to assist S corporations in sponsoring ESOPs.\n\nThe bill directs the Department of Labor to appoint an Advocate for Employee Ownership."
