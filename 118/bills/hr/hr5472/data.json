Such disclosure includes any controlling documents in force upon enactment, any controlling documents issued thereafter, and any changes to controlling documents. The bill also limits the authority of Treasury to make certain exceptions regarding proposed or final rules related to FinCEN to the person performing the duties of the Secretary.\n\nThe bill extends the time period during which Treasury must testify before Congress regarding FinCEN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-money laundering programs for another five years.\n\nFinCEN must also hold an annual small business working group to provide guidance on beneficial ownership reporting obligations.\u00a0"
