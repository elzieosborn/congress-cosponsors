This bill exempts from the Social Security Retirement Earnings Test (RET) certain benefits paid to surviving spouses and divorced spouses caring for the children of individuals who died while serving on active duty in the Armed Forces.&#160;

Specifically, under the bill, Social Security mother's and father's benefits payable to such surviving spouses and surviving divorced spouses are not subject to RET deductions. Currently, under the RET, benefits are reduced for beneficiaries who are younger than full retirement age if they earn wages in excess of a specified annual limit.&#160;</summary>
