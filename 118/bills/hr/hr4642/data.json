Specifically, financial regulators must notify Congress and the public of the details of an international negotiation prior to entering into the negotiation. Financial regulators also must (1) report to Congress the rationale, objectives, and the potential impacts of positions taken on matters before international regulatory bodies; and (2) publish summaries of meetings with international financial organizations. Finally, international agreements with an international financial organization require a public comment period."
