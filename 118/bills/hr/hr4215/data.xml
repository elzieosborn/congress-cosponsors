  <summary date="2023-09-18T18:44:00Z" status="Introduced in House">End Price Gouging for Medications Act

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to set maximum prices for prescription drugs under specified federal health programs. Specifically, HHS must establish reference prices based on certain factors, including the lowest retail price for a drug among specified reference countries.

Retail prices of covered drugs under specified federal health programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) may not exceed the established reference prices. Drugs must also be available at such prices to uninsured individuals and to individuals with private health insurance.</summary>
