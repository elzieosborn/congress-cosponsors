This bill generally prohibits the issuance or ownership of central bank digital currencies. A central bank digital currency is a digital currency issued by a government-backed central bank.

Under the bill, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks are prohibited from minting or issuing a central bank digital currency. In addition, a Federal Reserve bank is prohibited from offering products or services directly to an individual or entity, providing coins or currency directly to an individual or entity, or maintaining an account on behalf of an individual or entity, with some exceptions.

Further, no person is allowed to hold or own central bank digital currency belonging to the United States or a foreign country. &#160;</summary>
