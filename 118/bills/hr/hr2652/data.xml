This bill expands who may be considered an accredited investor for purposes of participating in private offerings of securities. (Certain unregistered securities may only be offered to accredited investors.) Specifically, the bill allows an individual to qualify if their aggregate investment in such a securities offering is not more than 10% of the individual's net assets or 10% of the individual's annual income, whichever is greater.</summary>
