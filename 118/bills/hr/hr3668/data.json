Specifically, personnel of the Retired Reserve who are not yet age 60 but are receiving their retirement pay may purchase TRICARE health coverage for retired military personnel, rather than the presently allowed TRICARE Retired Reserve.\n\n Under current law, Reserve Component personnel may retire below age 60, but not below 50, based on active duty performance."
