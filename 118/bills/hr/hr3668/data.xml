  <summary date="2024-03-29T22:23:35Z" status="Introduced in House">TRICARE Fairness for National Guard and Reserve Retirees Act

This bill aligns eligibility for TRICARE health coverage with the age at which personnel of the Retired Reserve (former National Guard and Reserve members) begin receiving retired pay. Specifically, personnel of the Retired Reserve who are not yet age 60 but are receiving their retirement pay may purchase TRICARE health coverage for retired military personnel, rather than the presently allowed TRICARE Retired Reserve.

 Under current law, Reserve Component personnel may retire below age 60, but not below 50, based on active duty performance.</summary>
