The bill applies to educational agencies and institutions that serve students in grades 6-12.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires ED to provide each educational agency and institution subject to the rule with the resources, guidelines, and technical assistance necessary to comply with the rule\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirements.\n\nFurther, ED must establish compliance monitoring, including periodic assessments, evaluations, and audits.\n\nFinally, ED must (1) encourage educational agencies and institutions to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the rule\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirements, and (2) review such feedback and make necessary revisions to the rule."
