This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to issue a rule requiring educational agencies and institutions, as a condition of receiving certain federal education funds, to carry out school-based suicide prevention protocols, suicide postvention support, and trauma-informed care. The bill applies to educational agencies and institutions that serve students in grades 6-12.

Additionally, the bill requires ED to provide each educational agency and institution subject to the rule with the resources, guidelines, and technical assistance necessary to comply with the rule&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s requirements.

Further, ED must establish compliance monitoring, including periodic assessments, evaluations, and audits.

Finally, ED must (1) encourage educational agencies and institutions to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the rule&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s requirements, and (2) review such feedback and make necessary revisions to the rule.</summary>
