ERS must publish the report within one year of the Census of Agriculture being made publicly available. The Census of Agriculture is conducted every five years; the 2022 census is scheduled for release in 2024.\n\nThe ERS report must include (1) information on changes in the size and location of ranches, farms, processing facilities, and packers throughout the United States; and (2) the impact of these changes on farmers, ranchers, and downstream consumers."
