DOE must select projects that (1) best advance research undertaken by DOE and the Department of Transportation (DOT), and (2) incorporate a range of technology focus areas.\n\nIn consultation with DOT and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), DOE must establish a joint research and development program concerning advanced and innovative materials and technologies for pipeline transportation systems. DOE must enter into or update an existing memorandum of understanding with DOT and NIST to administer the joint program.\n\nDOE must also establish a National Pipeline Modernization Center, which must focus on collaborating with industry and stakeholders to coordinate and carry out research, development, and demonstration projects related to commercializing cost-effective products and procedures aligned with the goals and priorities set forth by DOE.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, NIST must carry out a program of measurement research, development, demonstration, and standardization to (1) ensure the integrity of pipeline facilities; and (2) support pipeline safety, security, efficiency, sustainability, and resilience."
