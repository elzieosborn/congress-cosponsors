  <summary date="2024-07-08T21:07:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands certain reporting requirements about the prevalence of substance use disorders in the Medicaid population to include data about mental health conditions. It also makes these reporting requirements permanent.

Specifically, the bill requires the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) Substance Use Disorder Data Book, which is published by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to include information about the prevalence of mental health conditions and related treatment services among Medicaid beneficiaries. Currently, the book focuses on substance use disorders, particularly opioid use disorders, and related services.

The bill also permanently requires HHS to publish this book annually. Current law requires annual publication through 2024.</summary>
