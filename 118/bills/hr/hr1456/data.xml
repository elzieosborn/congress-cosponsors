This bill restricts the federal government from providing certain types of support to U.S. companies that make films with alterations or content conditions imposed by the Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The bill prohibits the Department of State from providing technical support or access to State Department assets to a U.S. company producing or funding films unless the company meets certain conditions (including entering into a written agreement with the State Department not to alter the content of the film in response to, or in anticipation of, a request from Chinese or CCP officials).

The bill also prohibits the President from authorizing technical support, access to federal assets, or film-related contracts for films by certain U.S. companies. This prohibition applies to U.S. companies that (1) submitted films to Chinese or CCP officials for evaluation after the date of enactment of this bill or within the past 3 years (whichever time period is shorter), and (2) altered the films in response to, or in anticipation of, a request by such officials. The prohibition also applies to companies that submitted films up to 10 years prior if the films were altered after the company had signed an agreement with the State Department not to alter content. Additionally, such support may not be provided for films co-produced by an entity located in China that is subject to content conditions imposed by the Chinese government or the CCP.</summary>
