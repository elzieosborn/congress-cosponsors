    "text": "Parents Opt-in Protection Act\n\nThis bill revises the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), which governs the administration to students of a survey, analysis, or evaluation that reveals information related to any of the eight protected areas (e.g., political affiliations, sex behavior or attitudes, and religious beliefs).\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires prior written consent of the student (if the student is an adult or an emancipated minor) or parent (if the student is an unemancipated minor) for such a specific survey, analysis, or evaluation. Currently, PPRA does not specify that this consent must be written.\n\nLocal educational agencies must update their student privacy policies to specify that students shall not be required to submit to a survey without prior written consent."
