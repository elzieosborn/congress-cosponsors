This bill establishes the Supply Chain Resiliency and Crisis Response Office to monitor and respond to disruptions in critical industries and supply chains.

Specifically, the office must (1) identify high-priority supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities in critical industries, (2) identify and evaluate the effect of supply chain disruptions on U.S. economic security, and (3) collaborate with other governmental bodies and key international partners to identify opportunities to reduce supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities.

The office also must establish a unified coordination group to oversee the interagency response to supply chain shocks and the office must designate certain critical industries, supply chains, and critical goods and services.

The bill includes various reporting requirements.</summary>
