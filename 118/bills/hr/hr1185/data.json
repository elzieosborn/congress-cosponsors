    "text": "Make Education Local Act of 2023\n\nThis bill creates a framework under which states may receive federal elementary and secondary education funds on a consolidated basis and use such funds for any educational purpose permitted by state law.\n\nSpecifically, the bill permits each state to submit to the Department of Education a state management decision that, among other requirements, describes how the state will address persistently failing public schools. The bill defines state management decision as a state decision to assume full management responsibility for the expenditure of federal funds to advance the educational policy of the state. The duration of a state management decision shall be between 5 and 10 years.\n\nAdditionally, each state that operates under a state management decision must establish an accountability system that focuses on the academic achievement of students and includes a system for evaluating the academic achievement and progress of students."
