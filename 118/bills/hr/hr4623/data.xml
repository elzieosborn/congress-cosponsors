This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish the Cyber Shield Program, a voluntary certification program for certain internet-enabled products that meet cybersecurity and data security benchmarks. Products certified through the program must be consumer-facing physical objects that are capable of collecting, sending, or receiving data or control the actions of a physical object or system.

Commerce must also establish a Cyber Shield Advisory Committee to recommend (1) the format and content of Cyber Shield labels for the products; and (2) the process to identify, establish, report on, adopt, maintain, and promote compliance with industry-leading cybersecurity and data security benchmarks to enhance cybersecurity and protect data.

On its website, Commerce must make publicly available (1) program information, (2) a database of products certified under the program, and (3) contact information for each manufacturer of a product certified under the program.</summary>
