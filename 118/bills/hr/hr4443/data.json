It also requires certain federal actions to address this issue.\n\nThe prohibition does not apply if U.S. Customs and Border Protection (1) determines, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the goods were not made with child labor or forced labor; and (2) submits to Congress a report containing such a determination (and makes this report publicly available).\n\nThe bill requires the President to annually report to Congress on each foreign person determined to have (1) knowingly engaged in child labor or forced labor in\u00a0DRC's mining industry, and (2) knowingly engaged in efforts to contravene U.S. law regarding the importation of covered DRC goods.\u00a0The President must impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions against each identified foreign person.\n\nThe bill requires\u00a0\n\nthe Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force to submit to Congress a report containing an enforcement strategy for effectively addressing child labor and forced labor in\u00a0DRC's mining industry,the Department of State to submit to Congress a strategy for addressing child labor and forced labor in\u00a0DRC's mining industry, andthe U.S. Agency for International Development to increase efforts to prevent child labor and forced labor in DRC's mining industry. \u00a0"
