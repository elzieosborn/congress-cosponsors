  <summary date="2024-07-18T10:48:08Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to publish food safety criteria, and review requests, for meat and poultry establishments to operate at alternate inspection rates. (Under the bill,&#160;alternate inspection rates are any rates in excess of the maximum rates permissible under regulations implementing the post-mortem inspection requirements of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act.)

The bill requires USDA to approve or deny a request to operate at alternate inspection rates within 90 days of submission. If USDA fails to respond within 90 days, the establishment&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s request shall be deemed approved by USDA.

Once USDA approves a request, an establishment may continue to operate pursuant to the terms of the request (i.e., the approval does not expire).

The bill establishes written notice requirements and a timeline for USDA to revoke an establishment's authority to operate at alternate inspection rates. As part of the revocation timeline, USDA must consult with the establishment to minimize the negative impacts of adjusting the inspection rates.

Further, USDA must authorize establishments currently operating under alternate inspection rates (e.g., under a USDA pilot program) to&#160;continue operating at such rates (1) so long as the establishment maintains effective process control, or (2) until USDA approves or denies a submitted request to operate at alternate inspection rates.</summary>
