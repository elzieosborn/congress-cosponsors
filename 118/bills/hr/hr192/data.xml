  <summary date="2024-05-21T13:07:25Z" status="Reported to House">This bill prohibits a non-U.S. citizen from voting in a District of Columbia (DC) election and repeals relevant provisions of DC law.

Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in a federal election; however, in 2022, DC enacted a law allowing&#160;noncitizens who meet residency and other requirements to vote in local elections. This bill repeals the DC law, which went into&#160;effect on February 23, 2023.&#160;
