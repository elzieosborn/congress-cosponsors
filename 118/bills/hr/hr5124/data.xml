This bill increases the length of the&#160;post-employment ban on lobbying&#160;(commonly known as the cooling-off period) that applies to former senior-level executive branch officials.

Current law prohibits these employees from representing a client (i.e., lobbying) before the former employing department or agency for one year following the separation from employment. The bill extends this period to two years.</summary>
