This bill requires the U.S. government to redirect resources away from nuclear weapons if other countries take steps to eliminate such weapons.

Specifically, after the President certifies that all countries possessing nuclear weapons have begun the verifiable and irreversible elimination of such weapons under the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the U.S. government must redirect resources being used for nuclear weapons programs to (1) addressing the climate crisis, (2) addressing human and infrastructure needs, and (3) encouraging other countries to pursue similar goals.</summary>
