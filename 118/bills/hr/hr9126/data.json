    "text": "Digital Social Platform Transparency Act\n\nThis bill requires large digital social platforms, or their parent companies, to make certain public disclosures about platforms' terms of service, responses to content flagged as violating those terms, and content moderation policies. The bill directs digital social platforms to post their terms of service publicly, and such terms must include a description of the mechanisms through which users may report content that violates the terms.\n\nThe bill also requires each platform to submit semiannual reports to the Department of Justice (DOJ) that include, among other disclosures\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00a0 \u00a0the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current terms of service;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00a0 \u00a0a statement of whether and how certain categories of content are defined in the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms, including hate speech, racism, disinformation, harassment, and foreign political interference;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00a0 \u00a0a description of the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content moderation policies; and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 \u00a0 \u00a0reports on flagged violations of the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms of service and the disposition of any flagged content.\n\nDOJ must make such reports publicly available online. The bill imposes a per-day fine on platforms that fail to report or misrepresent required information.\n\nUnder the bill, digital social platforms are defined as internet-based platforms that function primarily to allow users to interact socially by creating and viewing content and which generate more than\u00a0$100 million in annual gross revenue. Some categories of online platforms are explicitly excluded, including those that primarily facilitate email communications and consumer transactions. \u00a0"
