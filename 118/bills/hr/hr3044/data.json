    "text": "Require the Exposure of AI-Led Political Advertisements Act or the REAL Political Advertisements Act\n\nThis bill expands certain disclosure and disclaimer requirements for political campaigns, including by requiring disclaimers on advertisements containing content generated by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires a communication (e.g., a political advertisement) to include, in a clear and conspicuous manner, a statement if the communication contains an image or video footage that was generated in whole or in part with the use of AI. The bill outlines the requirements for determining a clear and conspicuous manner as it applies to specified communications (e.g., text or video communications).\n\nThe bill directs the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to issue a regulation related to generative AI, including the criteria for determining whether an advertisement contains an image or video footage created through generative AI.\n\nThe bill also requires reporting to the FEC of paid internet or digital communications."
