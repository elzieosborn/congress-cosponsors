    "text": "Terminate CDC Overreach Act\n\nThis bill narrows the authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to create regulations on controlling the spread of disease.\u00a0\n\nUnder current law, the\u00a0CDC is authorized to create regulations generally relating to quarantine and isolation to prevent the spread of disease between people. This includes regulations applicable to individuals traveling interstate that are reasonably believed to have a disease in a qualifying stage, meaning the disease is contagious or would likely cause a public health emergency if transmitted. The bill specifies that there must be\u00a0a positive clinical test, rigorous contact tracing, or clinical presentation of the disease in order for individuals to be considered as having a disease in a qualifying stage for purposes of regulation. The bill also\u00a0specifies that\u00a0CDC\u00a0regulations must relate to preventing the spread of disease between states through the identification, isolation, or destruction of the disease itself. The bill establishes procedures for Congress to expedite consideration of joint resolutions of disapproval for\u00a0CDC regulations on this topic.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the bill prohibits the CDC from creating a new regulation or policy on controlling the spread of disease that is intended to influence the general public unless the CDC publishes with it evidence supporting the measure, including updated science briefs."
