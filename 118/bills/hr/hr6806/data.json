The program must be based on the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nIn order for USDA to certify software under the program, the software must\u00a0(1) perform accurately; and (2) consistently meet\u00a0or exceed the federal and state licensure, certification, and permitting standards applicable to a person performing the task. (The bill includes requirements for these\u00a0standards.)\n\nUSDA must prescribe any regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out this bill.\u00a0"
