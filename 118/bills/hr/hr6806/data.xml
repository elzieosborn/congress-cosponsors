This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a program to certify software that uses artificial intelligence to perform a task in connection with producing agricultural products. The program must be based on the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

In order for USDA to certify software under the program, the software must&#160;(1) perform accurately; and (2) consistently meet&#160;or exceed the federal and state licensure, certification, and permitting standards applicable to a person performing the task. (The bill includes requirements for these&#160;standards.)

USDA must prescribe any regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out this bill.&#160;</summary>
