The sanctions authorized by this bill include\n\n directing the U.S. Export-Import Bank not to provide that person with guarantees, insurance, or credit; prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from extending credit to that person (except for activities to relieve human suffering); prohibiting transfers of credit or payments between financial institutions if such transfers or payments are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and involve the sanctioned person's interests; and prohibiting U.S. persons (individuals or entities) from investing in or purchasing significant amounts of equity or debt instruments of sanctioned persons. The provisions of this bill expire on the earlier of (1) the date on which the President determines the conflict in Ukraine has ended, or (2) two years after the date of the bill's enactment."
