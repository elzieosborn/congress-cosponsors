This bill establishes programs and requirements to assist individuals with disabilities and older adults (age 50 or older) with disaster preparedness.

Among other provisions, the bill

 allows states to contract with centers for independent living to provide services and support to disabled individuals in preparing for hazards; requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to carry out projects of national significance that, among other things, create opportunities for disabled individuals and older adults to directly contribute to disaster preparedness, recovery, and mitigation; modifies and expands the membership of the National Advisory Committee on Individuals with Disabilities and Disasters to ensure that it represents the diversity of the disabled and older adult communities; and establishes the Disability and Disaster Preparedness Advisory Committee to review settlement agreements involving potential violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Government Accountability Office must study the compliance of federal agencies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in expending funds to support disabled individuals and older adults in responding to, recovering from, and mitigating disasters.</summary>
