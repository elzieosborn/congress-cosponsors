  <summary date="2024-11-26T15:18:58Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits the United States from providing assistance to any international organization that supports, advocates for, or seeks to decriminalize sexual relations or sexual conduct by persons who are younger than the minimum age of consent, as defined by the national government of the country where such persons reside.&#160;

Assistance is also prohibited to any entity that supports or advocates for the belief that sexual activity involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual in fact even when it is not consensual under law.</summary>
