This bill prohibits the federal government from using certain federally administered lands to provide housing to any non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who have not been admitted into the United States.

Specifically, this prohibition shall apply to any land under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Forest Service.

The bill also revokes a 2023 lease between the National Park Service and the City of New York to use portions of the Gateway National Recreation Area to provide housing to migrant persons.</summary>
