  <summary date="2023-05-09T13:04:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Tax Filer Voter Registration Act or the Filer Voter Act

This bill treats certain tax return preparers as voter registration agencies.

Specifically, the bill requires tax return preparers who prepare at least 100 individual tax returns in a taxable year to provide voter registration application forms to their customers. The form must be made available by (1) displaying copies of the form in the preparer's office for customers who receive in-person services, and (2) providing a hyperlink to the form for customers who receive online services.

The bill also outlines the responsibilities of the Department of the Treasury to enable certified volunteer tax preparers to meet the requirements of the bill.</summary>
