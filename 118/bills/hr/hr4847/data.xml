This bill prohibits the Department of the Treasury from issuing or extending a general license (i.e., waiver) of the Syria Sanctions Regulations to respond to the February 6, 2023, earthquake in Syria. (Treasury issued Syria General License 23 to temporarily allow direct transactions related to earthquake relief efforts for 180 days.)

Additionally, the bill requires Treasury to provide Congress with at least 15 days advance notice of any changes related to the Syria Sanctions Regulations.</summary>
