This bill limits cost-sharing for insulin under private health insurance and Medicaid for individuals who are 26 years of age or younger.

Specifically, the bill caps cost-sharing under private health insurance and Medicaid for these individuals for a month's supply of selected insulin products at $35 or 25% of a plan's negotiated price (after any price concessions), whichever is less, beginning in 2024.</summary>
