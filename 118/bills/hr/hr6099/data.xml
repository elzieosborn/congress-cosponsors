This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to&#160;subject to expedited removal any non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) who is a resident of the Palestinian Territories and unlawfully present. (An unlawfully present individual has not been admitted or paroled into the United States.)

Under current law, an individual subject to expedited removal shall be ordered removed from the United States without further hearing or review unless the individual indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of prosecution.
