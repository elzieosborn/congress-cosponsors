    "text": "Halting Academic Liaisons To Our Adversaries Act or the HALT Our Adversaries Act\n\nThis bill\u00a0prohibits federal funding for institutions of higher education (IHEs) that have certain agreements with China or Russia.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to identify academic institutions of China, Russia, and other countries that are known to provide support to China's People's Liberation Army or Russia's armed forces. Further, the bill prohibits an IHE\u00a0from receiving federal funds if it maintains a contract or other agreement with such an academic institution identified by DOD.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits an IHE from receiving funds made available for an element of the intelligence community for research, development, testing, and evaluation if it maintains a contract or other agreement with (1) any entity identified as a Chinese military company operating in the United States, or (2) an academic institution of China that maintains a relationship with such an entity.\n\nThe bill also prohibits an IHE or other postsecondary educational institution from receiving federal funds (with exceptions for certain federal education funds) if it\u00a0has a contractual partnership in effect with an entity that is (1) owned or controlled by the Chinese government, or (2) organized under the laws of China.\u00a0The IHE or other postsecondary educational\u00a0institution may regain eligibility for these funds upon termination of the partnership."
