(OFAC, within the Department of the Treasury, is one of the agencies that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions.)\n\nSpecifically, GAO must conduct a study examining various aspects of OFAC\u2019s outreach activities, including (1) the goal and strategy of such activities; and (2) how, if at all, the activities help with sanctions enforcement.\n\nAfter reviewing the GAO study, OFAC must assess the feasibility of a voluntary public-private information sharing program to support efforts to administer and enforce economic sanctions.\n\nAfter reviewing the GAO study and OFAC feasibility assessment, Treasury may direct OFAC to establish a pilot program to facilitate such voluntary public-private information sharing."
