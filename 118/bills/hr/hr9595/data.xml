This bill addresses various issues related to federal procurement policy and the federal acquisition workforce. &#160;

For example, the bill requires

the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to establish a pilot program to consider incorporating experiential learning into the Federal Credentials Program, the Federal Acquisition Certification-Contracting Officer&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Representative Program, and the Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers Program;FAI to provide information and communications technology acquisition training for certain acquisition workforce members;the General Services Administration to assume responsibility from the Office of Management and Budget for developing and implementing an artificial intelligence training program for certain acquisition workforce members;the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to issue guidance to increase competition among eligible firms, including specifying means to validate non-government past performance references and using evaluation methods other than past performance when appropriate; andthe OFPP to implement regulatory and other non-legislative actions, based on input from the Chief Acquisition Officers Council and the public, to remove barriers to entry for small businesses seeking to participate in federal government procurement.The bill also increases the simplified acquisition threshold from $250,000 to $500,000 and the micro purchase threshold from $10,000 to $25,000. (The federal government uses less complex procedures for the purchase of property and services valued below the simplified acquisition threshold. Purchases below the micro purchase&#160;threshold generally do not require soliciting competitive quotations if the contracting officer considers the price to be reasonable.)</summary>
