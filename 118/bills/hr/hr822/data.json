The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) may award the grants to agencies or other subdivisions of a state, Indian tribe, or local government that are primarily responsible for health, public health, or education.\n\nRecipients must use funds to establish or maintain a helpline that provides information to school officials (to the extent permitted by federal privacy standards for health information) about student mental health and safety concerns and related activities.\n\nThe bill also requires SAMHSA to report on the feasibility of setting up a nationally available student mental health and safety helpline."
