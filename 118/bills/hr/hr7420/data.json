It also establishes the Minority Bank Deposit Program to prioritize the use of minority depository institutions to the maximum extent possible to serve the financial needs of federal departments and agencies.\n\nFederal banking agencies must issue rules allowing new minority depository institutions and impact banks to take three years to meet capital requirements."
