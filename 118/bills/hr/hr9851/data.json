    "text": "Hydrogen for Industry Act of 2024\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish programs that provide grants or cooperative agreements to support the use of hydrogen in heavy industry. Specifically, DOE must establish a program for projects that demonstrate the uses of hydrogen\u00a0in heavy industry (e.g., steel, cement, glass, and chemical manufacturing) to support the adoption of hydrogen as an emissions reduction technology. DOE must also establish a program for (1) carrying out projects that demonstrate the end uses of hydrogen; (2) constructing a new commercial-scale facility that will use hydrogen as a fuel or feedstock; or (3) retooling, retrofitting, or expanding an existing facility to enable the use of hydrogen as a fuel or feedstock in industrial end-use applications of hydrogen."
