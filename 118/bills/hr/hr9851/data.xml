This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish programs that provide grants or cooperative agreements to support the use of hydrogen in heavy industry. Specifically, DOE must establish a program for projects that demonstrate the uses of hydrogen&#160;in heavy industry (e.g., steel, cement, glass, and chemical manufacturing) to support the adoption of hydrogen as an emissions reduction technology. DOE must also establish a program for (1) carrying out projects that demonstrate the end uses of hydrogen; (2) constructing a new commercial-scale facility that will use hydrogen as a fuel or feedstock; or (3) retooling, retrofitting, or expanding an existing facility to enable the use of hydrogen as a fuel or feedstock in industrial end-use applications of hydrogen.</summary>
