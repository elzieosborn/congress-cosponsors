The plan must also include a spending plan and a proposal for adopting common solutions, consortial licensing agreements, or a solution for centralizing cybersecurity, telecommunications, and data systems at a single facility.\n\nAmong other factors specified in the bill, the NSF must consider approaches to align with international standards for encryption of sensitive information, requirements for controlled classified or unclassified information, and the network capabilities necessary to meet particular mission needs (such as to upload data to shoreside servers or to enable video communications with K-12 classrooms).\n\nThe NSF must provide Congress with a report on the plan's implementation within two years after the plan is\u00a0provided to Congress.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
