  <summary date="2023-12-08T14:10:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans Claims Education Act of 2023

This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to, upon receipt of an initial claim for benefits from a claimant that is not represented by an accredited person (i.e., a veterans service organization, attorney, or agent recognized by the VA) provide (1) notice that an accredited person may assist the claimant, (2) notice that a veterans service organization may represent the claimant for free, (3) information regarding a search tool to find an accredited person to assist in the filing of claims, and (4) information on how and where to report a person who is not accredited and charged a fee to assist with a claim.

In its web portal, the VA must provide a warning regarding fees an agent or attorney may charge for assistance in filing benefits claims. (Under current law, fees are generally prohibited for filing an initial claim.)</summary>
