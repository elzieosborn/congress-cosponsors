    "text": "End Child Trafficking Now Act\n\nThis bill imposes restrictions related to adult non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) being admitted into the United States with a minor.\n\nSuch an adult may not be admitted with a minor unless the adult (1) presents documents or witness testimony proving that the adult is a relative or guardian of the minor, or (2) submits to a DNA test that proves such a relationship. The Department of Homeland Security may request a DNA test only if the required relationship cannot be established by the presented documents or witness testimony. An adult who does not consent to a requested DNA test shall be inadmissible. If the required relationship cannot be established and the immigration officer believes the adult is guilty of a felony offense, the officer may arrest the adult.\n\nThe bill makes it a crime for an adult to knowingly use a minor to whom the adult is not a relative or guardian to enter the United States."
