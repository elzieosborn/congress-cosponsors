  <summary date="2023-06-30T19:56:28Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill excludes certain propane storage facilities from requirements under chemical facility anti-terrorism standards.

Specifically, such exclusion applies to a facility that stores propane for sale to or use by a dwelling, sale to or use in agricultural production, or sale to or use by small business concerns that are located in rural areas.

If the Department of Homeland Security determines that a propane storage facility does not satisfy the requirements of an excluded facility, it must report to Congress and notify the owner or operator of the facility.</summary>
