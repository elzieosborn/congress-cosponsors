This bill requires the Department of Transportation to establish a grant program that assists eligible entities in purchasing (1) heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles (e.g., trucks) that use hydrogen as a fuel source, and (2) related equipment. Certain entities that control heavy-duty truck fleets or public hydrogen fueling stations may apply for grants. Grant recipients must use the funding to demonstrate the performance of at least seven heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles that use hydrogen as fuel source or at least one hydrogen fueling station for use by such vehicles.</summary>
