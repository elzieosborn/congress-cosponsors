The bill provides time frames and voting percentages for the previously offered proposal that, if applicable, allow an issuer to exclude the new shareholder proposal.\n\nThe bill also prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from implementing a proposed rule published on July 27, 2022, titled Substantial Implementation, Duplication, and Resubmission of Shareholder Proposals under Exchange Act Rule 14a\u00e2\u20ac\u201d8, which addresses the exclusion of shareholder proposals."
