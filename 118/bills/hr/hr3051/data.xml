This bill requires the federal government to, before resettling, transporting, or relocating any non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) not in detention, consult with the affected state and local governments.

Specifically, the department taking the action, either the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), must consult with the affected state and local governments at least three days before the action.

HHS and DHS must also submit to Congress monthly state-specific reports about such actions.</summary>
