Specifically, this bill requires, to the greatest extent feasible, the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct efficient environmental reviews for port infrastructure projects, pipeline projects, and airport or aviation projects that require DOT's approval under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).\n\nIn addition, DOT must maintain and publish a database concerning such projects that are categorically excluded from NEPA requirements."
