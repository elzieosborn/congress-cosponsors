    "text": "Failed Bank Executives Accountability and Consequences Act \n\nThis bill allows the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to recover compensation from an executive officer or director of a failed financial company that is in receivership. Specifically, any current or former executive officer whose negligence caused financial loss to the company may have their compensation for the preceding two years clawed back by the FDIC. No time limit applies if the financial loss involves fraud.\n\nIn addition, federal banking agencies are allowed to prohibit a party from participation in the affairs of any bank if that party negligently caused financial loss to a failed bank.\n\nThe bill also establishes civil penalties for executive officers or directors who caused financial loss to a failed bank."
