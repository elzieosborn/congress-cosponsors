The board must examine and consolidate information provided by states and release considerations with respect to specified categories (e.g., processes for the administration of ballots delivered by mail, methods used to recruit poll workers, and procedures used to carry out postelection audits).\n\nThe bill allows states to use certain grant funds to implement any of the released voluntary considerations."
