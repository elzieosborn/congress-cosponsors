This bill directs the Election Assistance Commission's Standards Board to release voluntary considerations from states with respect to the administration of federal elections. The board must examine and consolidate information provided by states and release considerations with respect to specified categories (e.g., processes for the administration of ballots delivered by mail, methods used to recruit poll workers, and procedures used to carry out postelection audits).

The bill allows states to use certain grant funds to implement any of the released voluntary considerations.</summary>
