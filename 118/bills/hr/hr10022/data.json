    "text": "School Bus Safety Act of\u00a02023\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to issue rules requiring school buses to have certain safety features.\u00a0DOT must also establish a grant program to assist in the implementation of the requirements.\n\nSpecifically, DOT must issue rules requiring school buses to include\n\nthree-point safety belts for all seats,a fire suppression system which addresses engine fires,a firewall between the engine and passenger compartment\u00a0that prevents hazardous quantities of gas or flames from passing through the firewall,increased\u00a0performance standards for interior flammability and smoke emissions,an automatic emergency braking system,an event data recorder, andan electronic stability control system.DOT must also require at least eight hours of behind-the-wheel training for school bus operators that meets specified requirements.\n\nFurther, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must issue rules on\u00a0the evaluation of safety sensitive personnel for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nNHTSA\u00a0must also study the benefits of requiring school buses manufactured in, or imported into, the United States to be equipped with a motion-activated detection system that is capable of\u00a0detecting road users (e.g., pedestrians and bicyclists) and alerting the bus operator of their presence.\u00a0NHTSA must issue rules implementing such a requirement.\n\nFinally, DOT must establish a grant program to assist local educational agencies in (1) purchasing school buses equipped with three-point safety belts or any of the other safety features required under this bill, and (2) modifying\u00a0existing school buses."
