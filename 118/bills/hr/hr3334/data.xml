This bill requires the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on any member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee whom the President determines plays a significant role in developing or implementing policies that (1) violate the autonomy of Hong Kong; (2) harass or intimidate the people of Taiwan; or (3) contribute to the oppression of individuals or groups in China, including Uyghur Muslims. The President must also impose sanctions on the&#160;adult family members of such sanctioned persons.

The President may waive the sanctions for renewable periods of up to 60 days by certifying to Congress that&#160;the waiver is vital to U.S. national security interests.

The President may terminate any sanctions imposed after certifying to Congress that&#160;China's government and the CCP have ceased

the genocide of the&#160;Uyghur Muslim population; all threats, military exercises, and aggression toward Taiwan;undermining the autonomy of Hong Kong; andany efforts to steal the intellectual property of U.S. persons.The President may also terminate sanctions after certifying to Congress that the sanctioned person has renounced membership in the CCP and taken steps to denounce or remediate the conduct for which sanctions were imposed.

Any certifications related to termination of sanctions&#160;must also be publicly available on a federal government website.</summary>
