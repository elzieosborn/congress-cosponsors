This\u00a0prohibition does not apply to an individual who (1) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined is directly responsible for harming the security of the United States, or (2) is subject to extradition.\n\nUnder the bill, a covered individual shall receive work authorization.\u00a0\n\nThe bill directs DHS to provide notice of the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provisions to covered individuals. The notice shall include information explaining the requirements and instructions for filing a motion to reopen removal proceedings.\u00a0"
