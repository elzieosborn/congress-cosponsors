This bill prohibits the detention or removal of a national of Vietnam who entered the United States on or before July 12, 1995, has continuously resided in the United States since entry, and is subject to a final order of removal (i.e., covered individual). This&#160;prohibition does not apply to an individual who (1) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined is directly responsible for harming the security of the United States, or (2) is subject to extradition.

Under the bill, a covered individual shall receive work authorization.&#160;

The bill directs DHS to provide notice of the bill&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s provisions to covered individuals. The notice shall include information explaining the requirements and instructions for filing a motion to reopen removal proceedings.&#160;</summary>
