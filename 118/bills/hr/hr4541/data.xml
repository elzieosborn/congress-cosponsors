  <summary date="2024-02-05T20:14:06Z" status="Introduced in House">Resilience Investment, Support, and Expansion from Trauma Act of 2023 or the RISE from Trauma Act of 2023

This bill reauthorizes, establishes, and extends programs to support youth and families who have experienced, or may experience, trauma.

The bill reauthorizes through FY2028

 the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, school-based grants to increase access to trauma-support and mental health services, public health data collection about adverse childhood experiences, and a task force on trauma-informed care. It also establishes grants for

 multi-sector demonstration projects to mitigate trauma and toxic stress; improving outcomes for hospital patients who experience drug overdoses, suicide attempts, or violent injury; and clinical training in infant and early childhood mental health. Additionally, the bill authorizes (1) federal agencies to use specified discretionary funds for pilot projects to address traumatic exposures among children, and (2) Department of Justice (DOJ) grants to prevent trauma in children by reducing their exposure to violence and trauma.

Further, the Department of Health and Human Services must provide resources for training frontline service providers and certain community members about trauma, toxic stress, and resilience. In addition, DOJ must establish a national center to disseminate resources to law enforcement agencies to improve interactions with youth and families who are exposed to violence and trauma.

The bill also incorporates trauma-informed practices in programs for health care professional education, health care access, and educators.</summary>
