This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to set forth criteria (1) for the priority processing of claims related to compensation for service-connected disability for certain veterans (e.g., veterans affected by homelessness or major disasters), and (2) to establish flexible evidence requirements for veterans who are unable to meet ordinary evidence requirements for such priority claims due to a major disaster.</summary>
