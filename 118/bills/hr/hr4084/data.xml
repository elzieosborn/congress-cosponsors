This bill requires large financial institutions to defer part of senior employees' compensation and deposit the deferred compensation in a fund established by the institution. This fund must be used to pay civil or criminal fines levied against the institution or, if the institution is a bank or credit union, to make depositors whole in the event of a failure. If sufficient funds exist at the end of a specified period of time, senior employees must receive their deferred compensation.</summary>
