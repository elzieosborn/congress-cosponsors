    "text": "Working to Help Ensure Equity for Lithium-ion-powered Chairs on Airplanes Act or the WHEELChairs on Airplanes Act\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct an annual survey of all air carriers and foreign air carriers to compile each of their policies regarding lithium-ion battery-powered wheelchairs and mobility aids and determine whether any of the policies are more restrictive than FAA safety standards.\n\nThe bill requires air carriers with more restrictive policies than the FAA and those that do not have a policy in effect to update their policies. The FAA must assess a civil penalty for any policy of the air carrier that remains noncompliant."
