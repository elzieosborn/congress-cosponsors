  <summary date="2023-11-03T16:03:45Z" status="Introduced in House">VA Medical Center Security Report Act of 2023

This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to annually survey certain VA medical center employees (i.e., police chiefs, facility emergency management leaders, medical center directors, or a person carrying out the responsibilities of one of these positions in an acting capacity) to collect information regarding security at each VA medical center.

The bill also requires the VA to submit an annual report to Congress on the security at VA medical centers. Among other elements, the report must include the results of the annual survey and a plan for addressing any security weaknesses identified in the results.</summary>
