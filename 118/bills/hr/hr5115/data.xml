This bill requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to assign a resident inspector to each commercial nuclear power plant that has permanently ceased operation. The inspector must (1) conduct inspections of decommissioning activities and spent nuclear fuel transfer activities, and (2) remain at the plant until all fuel is transferred from its spent fuel pools to dry storage.</summary>
