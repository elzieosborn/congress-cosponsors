This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to revise the guidelines for federal agencies with respect to the dissemination or use of influential information or evidence, which includes scientific, technical, demographic, economic, financial, and statistical information or evidence that has (or reasonably will have) a clear or&#160;substantial impact in developing, issuing, or informing the public about a rule or guidance of the agency.

The guidelines must ensure that federal agencies rely on the best reasonably available influential&#160;information and evidence in developing, issuing, or informing the public about the rules and guidance of the agency.

An agency also must publish&#160;any model, methodology, or source of scientific or technical information relied on&#160;in issuing or developing any rule or guidance.&#160;</summary>
