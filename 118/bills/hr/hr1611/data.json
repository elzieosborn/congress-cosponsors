Dutch Salmon Greater Gila Wild and Scenic River Act\n\nThis bill designates specified segments of rivers and creeks of the Gila River system in New Mexico as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System and transfers 440 acres of land from the Gila National Forest to the Gila Cliff Dwellings Monument.\n\nThe Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture must consult with tribal governments, applicable political subdivisions of states, and the public when preparing the comprehensive management plan for such segments pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n\n Any nonfederal land within or adjacent to such a segment that is acquired by the United States shall be incorporated in, and be administered as part of, the applicable segment.\n\nNo land or interest in land shall be acquired without the owner's consent.\n\nThe Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture may authorize the construction of a native fish habitat restoration project (including any necessary fish barriers) within a covered segment if the project\n\n would enhance the recovery of a threatened or endangered species, a sensitive species, or a species of greatest conservation need, including the Gila Trout; and would not unreasonably diminish the free-flowing nature or outstandingly remarkable values of the covered segment. A native fish habitat restoration project located within an area designated as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be constructed consistent with the Wilderness Act and the applicable wilderness management plan."
