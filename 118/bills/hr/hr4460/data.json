    "text": "Non-citizens: Outlawed from Voting in Our Trusted Elections Act of 2023 or the NO VOTE for Non-Citizens Act of 2023\n\nThis bill establishes additional requirements related to noncitizens and voting and addresses related issues.\n\nCurrently, each state must conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official eligible voter lists by reason of the death of the voter or a change in the residence of the voter. In addition to these requirements, states must also make reasonable efforts to remove noncitizens from the official eligible voter lists.\n\nThe bill requires states that allow noncitizens to vote in state or local elections to maintain separate state voter registration lists for noncitizens.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires states and local jurisdictions that allow noncitizens to vote in their elections to ensure that the ballot used for casting votes by noncitizens may only include the candidates for state or local elections for which noncitizens are permitted to vote.\n\nFurther, the bill reduces election assistance payments to states and local jurisdictions that allow noncitizens to vote.\n\nIf a U.S. district court recuses an individual from jury duty on the grounds that the individual is a noncitizen, then the court shall transmit a notice of such recusal to the chief state election official and the Department of Justice.\n\nThe bill also references current federal law prohibiting noncitizens from voting in federal elections and related criminal penalties for violations. \u00a0"
