This bill establishes reporting requirements for states regarding certain Medicaid payments to abortion providers.

Specifically, the bill requires states that make Medicaid payments using&#160;federal funds for any items or services furnished by an abortion provider to annually (1) submit a report to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services on all such payments, and (2) publish the report on the state's website. The report must include specified information, including the number of abortions performed by the providers and the gestational age with respect to each such abortion. (Current law restricts the use of federal funds for abortions to cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment of the woman. States may use their own funds to cover abortions in other cases.)</summary>
