    "text": "Office of Technology Assessment Improvement and Enhancement Act\n\nThis bill renames and revises the functions and duties of the Office of Technology Assessment which, composed of a Technology Assessment Board and a director, provides Congress with assessments of probable technology application impacts. (The office has not been funded since FY1996.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill renames the office the Congressional Office of Technology, and it requires the office to undertake additional duties, such as providing to Members of Congress (1) certain information without the need for board review, (2) certain technical assistance on legislation related to science and technology without the need for board review, and (3) objective policy options on how Members may achieve goals with respect to science and technology policy.\n\nThe bill authorizes individual Members of Congress to submit to the board a request that the office undertake an assessment activity. Additionally, the bill requires the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office to coordinate technology assessment activities with the office to avoid duplication or overlapping of research activities.\n\nThe bill also (1) allows the office to temporarily appoint specified technical and professional personnel to work for the office, (2) requires the office to make the findings of completed analyses publicly available, (3) revises the appointment of board members, (4) requires the board to hold an annual meeting at which Members of Congress may appear and present information regarding technology assessment activities, and (5) requires the board to report annually on the activities of the office."
