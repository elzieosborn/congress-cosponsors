This bill creates a framework for the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to pilot the use of floating solar panels at Reclamation and USACE project sites. Before launching the pilot programs, Reclamation and the USACE must separately analyze and report on expected costs, benefits, technical requirements, and overall feasibility.</summary>
