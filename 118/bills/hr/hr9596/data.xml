This bill specifies that contracts and orders under the multiple award schedule program of the General Services Administration (GSA) may be evaluated on best value, rather than lowest overall cost, if the GSA determines that to be in the best interests of the federal government. (Best value allows consideration of non-cost factors when evaluating contract proposals to determine the offer that provides the greatest overall benefit. The GSA's multiple award schedules provide federal agencies with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and commercial services at prices associated with volume buying.)&#160;</summary>
