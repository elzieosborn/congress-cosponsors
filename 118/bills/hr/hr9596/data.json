(Best value allows consideration of non-cost factors when evaluating contract proposals to determine the offer that provides the greatest overall benefit. The GSA's multiple award schedules provide federal agencies with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and commercial services at prices associated with volume buying.)\u00a0"
