  <summary date="2023-06-28T20:59:22Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill makes the counting of electoral college votes in Congress a National Special Security Event.

A National Special Security Event is a designated event that, by virtue of its political, economic, social, or religious significance, may be the target of terrorism or other criminal activity. This designation authorizes the use of the U.S. Secret Service and certain funds to respond to the security needs resulting from such an event.</summary>
