  <summary date="2025-05-02T21:48:06Z" status="Public Law">Utah State Parks Adjustment Act

This act&#160;requires the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service to convey certain federal lands to Utah for inclusion in the following Utah State Parks: Antelope Island State Park, Wasatch Mountain State Park, and Fremont Indian State Park. Utah must use the lands for public purposes, including parks, campgrounds, recreation, and permitted livestock grazing.&#160;

Utah must also cover any costs relating to the conveyances for the Antelope Island State Park and the Wasatch Mountain State Park,&#160;including costs for surveys and other administrative costs.

As a condition of the conveyance to the Fremont Indian State Park, the Forest Service must (1) reserve&#160;easements to the conveyed&#160;land to be included in Fremont Indian State Park&#160;for all National Forest System roads and trails that originate at, terminate at, or traverse the conveyed land; and (2)&#160;convey to Utah only certain&#160;water rights that provide water to the Castle Rock Campground and the Belknap Historic Guard Station interpretive site. The act also authorizes the Forest Service to enter into an agreement with Utah with respect to additional terms and conditions applicable to the conveyance, such as&#160;maintenance of roads and trails.</summary>
