This bill eliminates the exemption of short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans from the federal requirements for individual health insurance coverage beginning on April 1, 2023.

Currently, short-term, limited-duration plans may offer coverage for a limited amount of time and are exempt from the market requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (e.g., coverage of individuals with preexisting conditions).</summary>
