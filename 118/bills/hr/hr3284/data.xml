This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to report annually on the impact of Medicare regulatory changes on provider and payer consolidation (e.g., vertical or horizontal integration among providers, suppliers, and other health care entities). The CMS must also solicit public comment on the projected impact of a proposed rule with respect to provider and payer consolidation.

The bill also requires the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to evaluate the impact of tested models on provider and payer consolidation.</summary>
