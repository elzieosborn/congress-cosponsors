    "text": "Backcountry Aviation Protection Act\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to revise regulations, as necessary,\u00a0to\u00a0allow a properly qualified pilot operating an aircraft to conduct a go-around, an inspection pass, a practice approach, or a qualified instrument approach without regard to minimum safe altitude standards. Under current\u00a0regulations, a person may not operate an aircraft below certain minimum safe altitudes except when necessary for takeoff or landing. The regulations do not include exceptions for situations such as a go-around (i.e., an aborted landing) or a practice approach.\n\nBeginning one year after the bill's enactment, if the FAA has not published final regulations as required by the bill, the FAA may not take an enforcement action against a person related to\u00a0a go-around, inspection pass, or practice approach.\n\nThe bill specifies that the FAA has the burden of proof with respect to enforcement actions to prove each element of the offense and the inapplicability of each exception to the offense.\u00a0"
