The USGS's list, which contains certain minerals that are essential to the nation's economic or national security, is not required to include the materials on DOE's list. Currently, both lists include minerals with a high risk of supply chain disruptions, and both DOE and USGS must conduct a variety of efforts to ensure a secure and reliable supply chain of the minerals.\u00a0\n\nBy expanding the definition of critical minerals, this bill requires the USGS to include on its list the materials on DOE's list. Within 45 days of DOE adding a \u00a0mineral, element, substance, or material to its critical materials list, the USGS must update its list to include such mineral, element, substance, or material. \u00a0\u00a0"
