  <summary date="2024-11-14T16:55:05Z" status="Reported to House">Critical Mineral Consistency Act of 2024

This bill modifies the Energy Act of 2020 to expand the definition of&#160;critical minerals to include critical materials designated by the Department of Energy (DOE).

Under current law, DOE's critical materials list contains certain materials that are essential for energy, including those on the critical minerals list of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS's list, which contains certain minerals that are essential to the nation's economic or national security, is not required to include the materials on DOE's list. Currently, both lists include minerals with a high risk of supply chain disruptions, and both DOE and USGS must conduct a variety of efforts to ensure a secure and reliable supply chain of the minerals.&#160;

By expanding the definition of critical minerals, this bill requires the USGS to include on its list the materials on DOE's list. Within 45 days of DOE adding a &#160;mineral, element, substance, or material to its critical materials list, the USGS must update its list to include such mineral, element, substance, or material. &#160;&#160;</summary>
