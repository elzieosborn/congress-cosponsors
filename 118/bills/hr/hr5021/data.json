(Under the bill, a critical mineral is any material or other substance designated as critical by Interior.)\n\nThe bill provides that an operator that extracts or processes critical minerals on federal land may not sell or transfer such critical minerals to a designated foreign terrorist organization, an entity involved in actions that resulted in a\u00a0convictionfor espionage, or other foreign entity of concern.\n\nAdditionally, such operators must annually report about these transfers\u00a0to the public and certify that transferees are not foreign entities of concern. The reports must also specify the critical minerals affected, location of the operator's activities, and\u00a0identity of the recipient of the mineral.\n\nThe bill authorizes Interior to address noncompliance with the bill's requirements by (1) denying a permit or other authorization; and (2) establishing administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.\u00a0\n\nInterior must annually report to Congress about its enforcement activities and\u00a0operators' annual\u00a0reports.\n\nFurther, Interior must collect a fee for any authorization related to extracting or processing of critical minerals on federal land, with revenues to be applied toward implementing the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirements,"
