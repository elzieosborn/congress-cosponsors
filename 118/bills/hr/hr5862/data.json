    "text": "This bill expands the authority of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to consolidate, modify, or reorganize customs revenue functions.\n\nFor example, this bill authorizes CBP to add functions to existing positions that perform these revenue functions. CBP may also establish new job series and grades for personnel that perform these functions.\n\nThe bill also modifies a provision that prohibits CBP from reducing the staffing level of certain revenue functions (e.g., import specialists, entry specialists, and customs auditors). Specifically, this bill relaxes this prohibition by allowing for reductions if the reduction will not result in a staffing level below the optimal level as determined in a specified resource allocation model. (Currently, CBP is required to report to Congress every two years the results of this model to determine the optimal staffing levels for carrying out CBP commercial operations.)\n\nThe bill also expands this staffing level reduction restriction to also apply to national account managers and international trade analysts."
