This act instead allows an April 22, 1980, agreement between the United States, Oregon, and the tribe (known as the Siletz Agreement) to define the tribe's rights until and unless it is amended or replaced upon mutual agreement of the tribe and Oregon (with specified limitations regarding a new agreement).\n\nThe act allows the tribe and Oregon to return to the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon to request the modification or termination of the May 2, 1980, consent decree."
