This bill requires and authorizes actions in response to the Chinese government's global surveillance program, including the Chinese government's use of surveillance balloons.

The President may impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign individuals that directly manage or oversee the Chinese government's global surveillance balloon program.

In addition, the Department of Commerce must report to Congress an evaluation of what export controls are appropriate for aerospace-related items and technologies that are used for intelligence and reconnaissance by China's military.

The bill also requires the Department of State to report to Congress a diplomatic strategy to (1) inform U.S. allies and partners of the scope of the Chinese government's surveillance program, and (2) build a global consensus to address the Chinese government's global surveillance balloon program.</summary>
