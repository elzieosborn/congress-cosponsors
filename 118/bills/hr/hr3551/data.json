The study must evaluate issues that include\n\n the usage and aircraft compatibility of age-appropriate child safety seats and restraints, procedures for evacuating children safely and efficiently from aircraft, the extent to which airport terminal design requirements include measures to ensure the general physical safety of children in the terminal and while on airport property, and the extent to which airport and airline policies protect children from contagious diseases or in-flight respiratory issues."
