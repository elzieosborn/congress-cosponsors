This bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct a comprehensive study on child safety in aviation in consultation with Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Transportation Security Administration. The study must evaluate issues that include

 the usage and aircraft compatibility of age-appropriate child safety seats and restraints, procedures for evacuating children safely and efficiently from aircraft, the extent to which airport terminal design requirements include measures to ensure the general physical safety of children in the terminal and while on airport property, and the extent to which airport and airline policies protect children from contagious diseases or in-flight respiratory issues.</summary>
