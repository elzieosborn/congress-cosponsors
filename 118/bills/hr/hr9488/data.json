The card's billing address must be in the United States, with an exception. For a contributor who is living outside of the United States and, at the time of the contribution, is a U.S.\u00a0national or lawfully admitted for permanent residence,\u00a0the bill requires the contributor to provide the political committee\u00a0with his or her voter registration address or identification document (e.g., U.S. passport).\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits political committees from accepting a contribution made through the use of a general-use prepaid card, gift certificate, or store gift card.\n\nThe bill also\u00a0prohibits\u00a0knowingly directing, helping, or assisting any person in making a contribution in the name of another person.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission must, within 10 days, promulgate regulations to carry out this bill."
