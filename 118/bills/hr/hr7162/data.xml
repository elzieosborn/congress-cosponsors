This bill establishes tax-exempt savings accounts for children who have not attained age 18 to be known as the 401Kids Account Program. Contributions to such accounts may not exceed $2,500 in a calendar year (adjusted for inflation). Accounts may pay expenses related to education, starting a small business, buying a residence, or promoting retirement security.&#160;

The Department of the Treasury must establish a permanent program, not later than December 31, 2024, to be known as the Federal 401Kids Account Program.&#160;

The bill authorizes disclosure of taxpayer information for administering the program. It also disregards account funds for purposes of determining eligibility for certain federal assistance programs.&#160;</summary>
