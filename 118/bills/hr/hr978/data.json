Such plan shall\n\n identify a location for a new headquarters; maximize any potential cost savings associated with the relocation; provide that, upon implementation of the plan, no more than 10% of agency employees are based in the Washington metropolitan area; and consider any potential national security implications of the relocation. Each agency shall implement the plan by September 30, 2028."
