  <summary date="2024-05-06T10:50:15Z" status="Introduced in House">Licensing Individual Commercial Exam-takers Now Safely and Efficiently Act of 2023 or the LICENSE Act of 2023 

This bill provides statutory authority for waivers of training, testing, and other requirements for commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) that were issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically, this bill allows a state or third-party examiner who has maintained a valid CDL test examiner certification and has previously completed a CDL skills test examiner training course to administer the CDL knowledge test, so long as they have completed one unit of the CDL knowledge test training course.

The bill also allows a state to administer a driving skills test to any CDL applicant regardless of the applicant's state of domicile or where the applicant received driver training.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</summary>
