This bill requires each institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs to provide certain information to prospective and enrolled students on the rights and resources for pregnant students to carry a baby to term or students who may become pregnant while enrolled at the IHE to carry a baby to term.

In particular, this required information must include

 a list of community and on-campus resources that exist to help a pregnant student in carrying the baby to term and caring for the baby after birth, information about the accommodations available to help a pregnant student carry the baby to term and parent the baby after birth, and information on how to file a discrimination complaint related to the student's determination to carry a baby to term.</summary>
