This bill increases the low-income housing tax credit to serve the housing needs of older people and people with disabilities. Specifically, the bill increases state allocations of the credit and credit amounts for projects for assisting households with disabled individuals.

The bill requires each state housing finance agency to establish and operate a Resource Center for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program to support new program applicants and recipients. It also establishes a National Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Advisory Council to provide best practice recommendations to state housing finance agencies and other entities relating to affordable housing trends.</summary>
