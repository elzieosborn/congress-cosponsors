This bill requires states and local jurisdictions, in order to receive election assistance payments, to have in effect a law that requires valid photo identification for voting in federal elections.

Specifically, the state or local jurisdiction must certify that the state has in effect a law that prevents state or local election officials from (1) providing a ballot for a federal election to an individual who desires to vote in person unless the individual presents a valid photo identification, and (2) accepting a ballot for a federal election from an individual who votes other than in person unless the individual submits with the ballot a copy of a valid photo identification.</summary>
