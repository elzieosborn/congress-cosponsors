    "text": "LNG Coordination Act of 2024\n\nThis bill establishes a process to coordinate the authorities of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Coast Guard with respect to liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, other than peak shaving facilities (e.g., facilities that reduce\u00a0LNG demand spikes).\n\nFirst, the bill directs the Department of Transportation to establish and convene a Liquefied Natural Gas Regulatory Safety Working Group through the National Center of Excellence for Liquefied Natural Gas Safety. The working group must evaluate the authorities of each entity pertaining to the\u00a0siting and design, construction, operation and maintenance, and operational and process safety regulations of LNG facilities.\u00a0\n\nNext, the working group must negotiate an agreement between the entities to establish procedures for (1) applying their respective authorities in a manner that ensures that LNG facilities are safe and in the public interest; (2) resolving conflicts concerning overlapping jurisdiction; and (3) avoiding conflicting or duplicative regulation, inspection protocols, and reporting obligations.\n\nWithin two years, the entities must enter into agreements with respect to best practices and individual agency safety oversight and enforcement responsibilities regarding LNG facilities, other than peak shaving facilities.\u00a0"
