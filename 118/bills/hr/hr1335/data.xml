  <summary date="2023-09-20T12:48:34Z" status="Reported to House, Part I">Transparency, Accountability, Permitting, and Production of American Resources Act or the TAPP American Resources Act

This bill provides for the exploration and development of energy resources (e.g., oil, gas, and minerals), including by (1) requiring additional federal oil and gas leasing, (2) expediting energy projects, (3) eliminating or reducing certain fees related to the development of federal energy resources, and (4) requiring certain revenue from energy development to be shared with states.

The Department of the Interior must conduct sales for the leasing of oil and gas resources on federal lands and waters as specified by the bill. For example, Interior must

 immediately resume quarterly sales of leases of onshore federal land for oil and gas development, conduct a minimum of four oil and gas lease sales in each state with land available for oil and gas leasing under mineral leasing law, issue a five-year oil and gas leasing program under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for 2023-2028, and approve each subsequent five-year oil and gas offshore leasing program no later than 180 days before the expiration of the previous program. Additionally, the bill expedites the development of energy resources, including by (1) limiting the scope of review of major federal actions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; and (2) expediting the environmental review of mineral exploration and production activities, such as coal mining.

The bill also reduces royalties for oil and gas development on federal land.

Finally, the bill increases the amount of revenue from energy development that is shared with coastal states.</summary>
