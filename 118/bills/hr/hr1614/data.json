The departments must identify at least one suitable location for a range in each forest or district where (1) there is not currently a range that meets requirements, and (2) establishing a range is not prevented by law or a land use plan.\n\nIn at least one suitable location in each forest or district with a suitable location, the departments shall\n\n subject to the availability of appropriations, construct a range or modify an existing range; or enter into an agreement with an entity to establish or maintain a range. A range established under this bill may not require a user to pay a fee to use the range."
