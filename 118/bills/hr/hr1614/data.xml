  <summary date="2023-10-12T22:49:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Range Access Act

This bill provides for the creation of new target shooting ranges on public land.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to publish a list that identifies whether each National Forest and each Bureau of Land Management district has a target shooting range that meets specified requirements. The departments must identify at least one suitable location for a range in each forest or district where (1) there is not currently a range that meets requirements, and (2) establishing a range is not prevented by law or a land use plan.

In at least one suitable location in each forest or district with a suitable location, the departments shall

 subject to the availability of appropriations, construct a range or modify an existing range; or enter into an agreement with an entity to establish or maintain a range. A range established under this bill may not require a user to pay a fee to use the range.</summary>
