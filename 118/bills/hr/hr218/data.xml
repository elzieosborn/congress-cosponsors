This bill provides statutory authority for a July 23, 2019, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notice that expanded the classes of non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who are subject to expedited removal (i.e., removal without further hearing or review).

DHS published another notice on March 21, 2022, rescinding the July 2019 notice. Thus, this bill in effect restores the expanded version of expedited removal under the July 2019 notice.

The July 2019 notice expanded expedited removal to cover certain inadmissible non-U.S. nationals who were apprehended in any part of the United States and who have been in the United States for less than two years. By contrast, with the March 2022 rescission, expedited removal is generally limited to certain inadmissible non-U.S. nationals apprehended near or at a border.</summary>
