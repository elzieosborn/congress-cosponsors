The kit must be clearly visible and labeled with the words Overdose Rescue Kit-Naloxone Nasal Spray (or other language approved by the local educational agency).\n\nThe bill outlines additional requirements related to these kits, including that the location of each kit must be registered with the school nurse and school resource officer."
