This bill requires each public elementary and secondary school to have an opioid overdose rescue kit.

Specifically, the Department of Education must consult and collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that each public elementary and secondary school has an opioid overdose rescue kit. The kit must be clearly visible and labeled with the words Overdose Rescue Kit-Naloxone Nasal Spray (or other language approved by the local educational agency).

The bill outlines additional requirements related to these kits, including that the location of each kit must be registered with the school nurse and school resource officer.</summary>
