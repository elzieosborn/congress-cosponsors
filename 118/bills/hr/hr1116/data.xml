This bill prohibits an individual who is indicted for or charged with a covered trafficking offense from receiving federal benefits.

Covered trafficking offense refers to a human trafficking offense or a drug trafficking offense occurring at an international border, or within the territorial waters, of the United States.

Federal benefit refers to (1) the issuance of any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by a U.S. agency or by appropriated U.S. funds; and (2) any retirement, welfare, Social Security, health, disability, veterans, public housing, or other similar benefit.

The bill requires the federal government to provide retroactive benefits payments for an individual who has the charge dismissed or is found not guilty of the covered trafficking offense.</summary>
