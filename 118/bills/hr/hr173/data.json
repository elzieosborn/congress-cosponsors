It also eliminates the prohibition on the transportation of such rifles in interstate commerce and treats persons who acquire or possess a short-barreled rifle as meeting the registration or licensing requirements for such rifle where such requirements are determined by reference to the National Firearms Act.\n\nThe bill preempts state or local laws that impose a tax or recordkeeping requirements on short-barreled rifles.\n\nThe Department of Justice must destroy records relating to the registration of\u00a0 certain rifles within one year after the enactment of this bill."
