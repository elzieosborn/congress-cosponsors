This bill makes assaulting a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder a deportable offense.

Specifically, the bill makes deportable any non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) who has been convicted of (or admits to have committed) any act that constitutes the essential elements of any offense involving assault of a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder.

The Department of Homeland Security must publish annually on its website a report on the number of individuals deported in the previous year pursuant to this bill.</summary>
