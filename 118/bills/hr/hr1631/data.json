(A technical standard created by a private organization is typically eligible for copyright protection, but some courts have ruled that standards incorporated into law lose their copyright protections for various reasons. For example, some courts have held that incorporated standards effectively became law and therefore entered the public domain.)\n\nUnder this bill, a technical standard shall retain its copyright protection even if it has been incorporated by reference into a law or regulation, if the applicable standards development organization makes the standard available on a free publicly accessible online source\u00a0and in a format that facilitates the location of specific content.\n\nIf a party asserts that an incorporated technical standard has lost its copyright protection because it has not been made available for free online, the party making that assertion shall bear the burden of proof.\n\nThe bill also includes reporting requirements for the Copyright Office and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO must conduct several studies and report on the findings, including the potential impacts of the bill on consumers and\u00a0historically disadvantaged communities."
