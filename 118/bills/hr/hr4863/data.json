Annually, issuers must report on expenditures for political activities made in the previous year over $10,000 and information related to anticipated expenditures for the next year.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the effectiveness of the Securities and Exchange Commission's oversight of these reporting and disclosure requirements. \u00a0"
