    "text": "Agricultural Commodities Price Enhancement Act of 2023\n\nThis bill increases the reference prices for certain commodities under the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs. Specifically, the bill increases the reference prices for wheat, corn, soybeans, peanuts, and seed cotton.\n\nThe ARC and PLC programs, administered by the Farm Service Agency, offer financial assistance to eligible agricultural producers, and the reference prices are used to calculate benefits under the programs. The ARC program is an income support program that provides payments to producers when actual crop revenue declines below a specified guarantee level. The PLC program provides income support payments when the effective price for a covered commodity falls below its effective reference price.\u00a0"
