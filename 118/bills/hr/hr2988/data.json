Through the partnership, DOE and NASA may conduct research in a variety of focus areas (e.g., dark matter), develop ways to support large voluntary data sets on space and aeronautical information, promote multi-agency data sharing, and support NASA's access to DOE research infrastructure.\n\nDOE and NASA must jointly report on their collaboration."
