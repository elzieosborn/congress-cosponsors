This bill provides statutory authority for a research and development partnership between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Specifically, the bill authorizes DOE and NASA to enter into a memorandum of understanding to support cross-cutting and collaborative research and development that furthers the missions of both agencies. Through the partnership, DOE and NASA may conduct research in a variety of focus areas (e.g., dark matter), develop ways to support large voluntary data sets on space and aeronautical information, promote multi-agency data sharing, and support NASA's access to DOE research infrastructure.

DOE and NASA must jointly report on their collaboration.</summary>
