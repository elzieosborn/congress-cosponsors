This bill directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to adopt voluntary guidelines for election officials on the use of nonvoting election technology.&#160;Nonvoting election technology&#160;refers to the technology used in the administration of federal elections which is not used directly in the casting, counting, tabulating, or collecting of ballots or votes (e.g., electronic pollbooks or election result reporting systems). The EAC must review such guidelines every four years and may adopt revisions to the guidelines.

States may use election administration funds to obtain or upgrade nonvoting election technology which is in compliance with the&#160;EAC's voluntary guidelines. States may also use certain unobligated grant funds until December 31, 2024, for the purposes of enhancing election technology and making election security improvements. &#160;</summary>
