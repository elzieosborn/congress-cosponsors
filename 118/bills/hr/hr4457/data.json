The EAC must review such guidelines every four years and may adopt revisions to the guidelines.\n\nStates may use election administration funds to obtain or upgrade nonvoting election technology which is in compliance with the\u00a0EAC's voluntary guidelines. States may also use certain unobligated grant funds until December 31, 2024, for the purposes of enhancing election technology and making election security improvements. \u00a0"
