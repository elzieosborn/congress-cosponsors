This bill requires congressional approval for a presidential import adjustment due to a national security threat from an import related to military equipment, energy resources, or critical infrastructure essential to national security. Specifically, the bill requires the President to submit a proposal to Congress, which Congress may approve by a joint resolution. Under current law, the President determines whether any adjustment of an import is necessary and must submit to Congress the reasons for any action taken or not taken.

The Department of Defense (currently, the Department of Commerce) must investigate the effect of these imports on national security.

The bill retroactively applies to any proposed action made six years before enactment of this bill.</summary>
