  <summary date="2024-03-01T16:18:52Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides that an individual's Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits must not be charged for a course or program if the VA determines the individual could not complete the course or program because (1) it was suspended or terminated due to information collected as part of a VA risk-based survey, or (2) the Department of Education has determined the educational institution committed an actionable act or omission that had a detrimental effect on direct loan borrowers.

The bill also provides that as a condition of the approval of a course or program of education, an educational institution offering the course or program must agree to repay to the VA all educational assistance amounts if the institution closes or suspends or terminates a course or program because the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Education determined there was fraud.</summary>
