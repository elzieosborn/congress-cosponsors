This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish procedures under which it must review and reinvestigate allegations of civilian harm that resulted from military operations involving the U.S. Armed Forces between 2011 and 2023 and that DOD finds were likely incorrectly dismissed due to investigation errors or incomplete information.

In establishing the review procedures, DOD must consult with nongovernmental organizations that focus on civilian harm and human rights.

Additionally, DOD must report on any identified errors, steps taken to respond to such errors, and recommended steps to prevent similar errors in the future.</summary>
