    "text": "Positioning the Election Assistance Commission for the Future Act of 2023\n\nThis bill makes changes to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC).\u00a0\n\nThe bill revises certain requirements related to staffing and funding of the EAC. For example, the bill (1) limits the number of full-time equivalent employees that may be hired to carry out the duties and responsibilities of the EAC, and (2) permits an individual serving a term of service on the EAC to hold a position at an institution of higher education under specified circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, the bill provides the EAC with exclusive authority to make election administration payments to states.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Executive Board of the Standards Board to enter into certain contracts to enable the Standards Board to discharge its duties with respect to the examination and release of voluntary considerations for states to administer federal elections.\u00a0\n\nFurther, the bill specifies that the EAC has primary jurisdiction to address issues with respect to the administration of federal elections.\u00a0\n\nThe bill prohibits states and local governments from using payments from the EAC for any get-out-the-vote activity (i.e., activities that assist, encourage, or urge potential voters to vote).\n\nThe bill also requires public communications that are funded by EAC payments to include a specified disclaimer. \u00a0"
