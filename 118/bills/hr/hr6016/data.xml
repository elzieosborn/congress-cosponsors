  <summary date="2024-10-04T19:27:47Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires certain agencies to coordinate and support activities to advance quantum information science.

Specifically, the National Quantum Coordination Office must establish a liaison&#160;between the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to coordinate activities under the National Quantum Initiative Program. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine must report on the program's progress.&#160;

The bill also requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to support a Manufacturing USA institute that focuses on manufacturing processes and the related workforce for quantum&#160;computing and technology.</summary>
