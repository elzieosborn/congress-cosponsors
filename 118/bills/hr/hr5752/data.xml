This bill allows a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) to provide up to $500 of mental health benefits before the annual deductible is met as part of its plan benefits and still be classified as an HDHP.&#160;

Under current law, to be considered health savings account-eligible, an HDHP must have a deductible above a certain minimum threshold amount, which is adjusted annually. For 2024, a health plan's annual deductible must be at least $1,600 for self-only coverage and $3,200 for family coverage to qualify as an HDHP.&#160;</summary>
