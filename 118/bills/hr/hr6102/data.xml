This bill establishes the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of American LGBTQI+ History and Culture.

The commission must submit reports that address

 the feasibility of establishing and maintaining such a museum, the availability and cost of collections to be acquired and housed in the museum, the impact of the museum on existing American LGBTQI+ history-related museums, development of criteria for evaluating possible locations for the museum, and the feasibility of the museum becoming part of the Smithsonian Institution. The commission must develop a fundraising plan that will address the support of the museum through contributions from the public. No federal funds may be obligated to carry out this bill.</summary>
