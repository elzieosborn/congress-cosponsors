This bill reinstates the tax deduction for the itemized miscellaneous expenses of employees performing services in a trade or busines (the deduction is currently suspended for the period beginning in 2018 through 2025). The amount the an employee may take into account in computing the deduction is 85% of unreimbursed food, lodging, travel, or transportation expenses.

The bill also lowers the threshold for the deduction to the extent its aggregate amount exceeds 1% (2% under current law).</summary>
