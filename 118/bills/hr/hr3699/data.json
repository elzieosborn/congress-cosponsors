Further, DOE must prioritize the education and training of underrepresented groups in such jobs.\n\nIn carrying out the bill, DOE must establish a clearinghouse to (1) maintain and update information and resources on training and workforce development programs for such jobs; and (2) provide technical assistance for states, schools, and other specified entities. DOE must also conduct outreach to minority-serving institutions of higher education and dislocated energy and manufacturing workers."
