  <summary date="2024-06-18T10:39:39Z" status="Introduced in House">Widening Opportunities to Recapture Key Energy Roles Act or the WORKER Act

This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE), when considering awards for existing grant programs, to prioritize education and training for energy and manufacturing-related jobs. Further, DOE must prioritize the education and training of underrepresented groups in such jobs.

In carrying out the bill, DOE must establish a clearinghouse to (1) maintain and update information and resources on training and workforce development programs for such jobs; and (2) provide technical assistance for states, schools, and other specified entities. DOE must also conduct outreach to minority-serving institutions of higher education and dislocated energy and manufacturing workers.</summary>
