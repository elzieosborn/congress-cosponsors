Specifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is prohibited from insuring such a loan, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prohibited from purchasing such a loan, unless a borrower provides specified tenant protections, including\n\n one-year renewable lease terms, unless there is good cause for nonrenewal; at least a 60-day advance notice of any increase in rent, or of a sale or closure of the community; a five-day grace period for rent payments; and a right for a tenant to sell a manufactured home within a reasonable time period after eviction. The bill sets forth penalties for violations of these protections.\n\nThe bill also establishes the Manufactured Home Company Lending Standards Commission to propose additional consumer protection standards."
