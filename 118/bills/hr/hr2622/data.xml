  <summary date="2023-10-30T12:53:29Z" status="Passed House">This bill extends for six months Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance allowing broker-dealers to receive payments for research services provided to investment managers. Under current law, broker-dealers that receive payments for performing this service must register as investment advisors. However, the SEC through guidance currently waives enforcement against these broker-dealers. This waiver is set to expire on July 3, 2023.

The SEC must report on the impact of continuation or expiration of this guidance.</summary>
