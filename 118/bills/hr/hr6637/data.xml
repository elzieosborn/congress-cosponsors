This bill prohibits the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR) from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing regulations under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that apply to abortion, abortion coverage, or abortion-related services.

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act requires covered employers to provide reasonable&#160;accommodations addressing an employee's limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The law requires the EEOC and the OCWR to issue implementing regulations and specifies that regulations shall provide examples of reasonable accommodations addressing known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.&#160;</summary>
