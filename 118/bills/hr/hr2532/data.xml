This bill establishes a Commission on Men's and Women's Fairness in College Sports.

The commission must (1) compare how the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) operates men's and women's championship tournaments with respect to the treatment of the participating men's and women's college sports teams, and (2) prepare and submit to Congress a report on its findings with recommendations on how the NCAA can improve the fair treatment of participating men's and women's teams in such tournaments and student-athlete programs.

The commission may not review or make recommendations on the eligibility of any athlete to participate in men's or women's college sports teams or in NCAA programming.

In appointing a member of the commission, special consideration shall be given to former college athletes, coaches, or athletic administrators.</summary>
