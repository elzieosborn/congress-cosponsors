The research must also focus on improving and integrating existing communications systems to allow for secure, real-time transmission of data, alerts, and advisories to fire management officials and wildland firefighters. In carrying out the research, the division must (1) conduct live and virtual field tests of equipment, software, and other technologies; and (2) consult with NIST's Fire Research Division and communication technology manufacturers.\n\nNIST must also publish recommendations to improve public safety communication coordination standards among wildland first responders and fire management officials. In addition, NIST must provide the recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for relevant agencies to implement.\n\nWithin one year of the publication of NIST's recommendations, the Government Accountability Office must report on the extent to which the agencies have implemented the recommendations."
