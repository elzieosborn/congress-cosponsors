  <summary date="2024-01-11T19:12:55Z" status="Reported to House">NIST Wildland Fire Communications and Information Dissemination Act

This bill requires research on public safety communication coordination standards related to wildland firefighting.

The Public Safety and Communications Research Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) must carry out research on such standards among wildland firefighters, fire management response officials, and specified federal agencies responsible for coordinating and mobilizing for wildland fire and other incidents. The research must also focus on improving and integrating existing communications systems to allow for secure, real-time transmission of data, alerts, and advisories to fire management officials and wildland firefighters. In carrying out the research, the division must (1) conduct live and virtual field tests of equipment, software, and other technologies; and (2) consult with NIST's Fire Research Division and communication technology manufacturers.

NIST must also publish recommendations to improve public safety communication coordination standards among wildland first responders and fire management officials. In addition, NIST must provide the recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for relevant agencies to implement.

Within one year of the publication of NIST's recommendations, the Government Accountability Office must report on the extent to which the agencies have implemented the recommendations.</summary>
