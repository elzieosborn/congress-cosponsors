    "text": "Secure Space Act of 2023\n\nThis bill prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from granting licenses or access to U.S. markets for geostationary or non-geostationary orbit satellite systems or authorizations for related earth-based stations that communicate with those systems to certain producers or providers of communications equipment or services. Specifically, the FCC may not grant a license, market access, or authorization to an entity that produces or provides equipment or a service that the FCC determines poses an unacceptable risk to national security or the security and safety of U.S. persons (e.g., Huawei Technologies Company and China Mobile International USA Inc.).\n\nGeostationary satellite systems include satellites that stay in the same position relative to points on the Earth's surface. Non-geostationary satellite systems are comprised of satellites that do not maintain a stationary position but rather move in relation to the Earth's surface. Both types of systems may be used to provide broadband and other telecommunications services."
