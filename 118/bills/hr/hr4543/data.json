The bill specifies that election results (1) may not be tabulated or reported to the public until after the polls close on election day,\u00a0and (2) must be reported by 10 a.m. the next day.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires election officials to make certain information available online, including the total number of voted ballots, the number of mail-in ballots, and the number of absentee ballots requested under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.\n\nThe bill also directs election officials to administer the election in a bipartisan manner, such as by pairing election workers of different political parties when one must enter a room containing election ballots.\u00a0"
