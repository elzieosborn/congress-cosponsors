    "text": "Connecting And Building Lines for Expedited Expansion Act or the CABLE Expansion Act\n\nThis bill modifies the requirements governing decisions about the placement, construction, or modification of equipment and related facilities that are used in or attached to cable communications systems.\n\nSpecifically, state or local governments, their instrumentalities, or franchise authorities (state or local entities that regulate certain aspects of cable operators) may not regulate the placement, construction, or modification of cable equipment or facilities in a manner that effectively prohibits a cable operator from providing or enhancing its service under a franchise granted by one of those entities.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires those entities to approve or deny a complete request to place, construct, or modify cable equipment or facilities within specified time frames. Failure to respond to the request within the specified time frame deems it automatically approved. Further, the bill requires that any denial of a request must be in writing, supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record, and publicly released at the same time as the decision is made.\n\nThe bill also permits an entity to charge fees for considering requests provided that the fees are (1) nondiscriminatory, (2) publicly disclosed in advance, and (3) based on actual and direct costs.\n\nThe modifications concerning the time frames for decisions and the fees apply retroactively to requests that are submitted prior to the enactment of the bill but have not been approved or denied."
