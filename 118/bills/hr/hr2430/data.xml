This bill requires a federal court to construe the imposition of a death penalty sentence for an individual convicted of an offense under state law for receiving or providing a reproductive health service (e.g., an abortion) as cruel and unusual punishment and a miscarriage of justice. It also authorizes civil suits by affected individuals and a right to habeas corpus relief in federal district court.</summary>
