    "text": "Communities Before Air Tourism Act\n\nThis bill requires a voluntary agreement for commercial air tour operations over a national park to address specific management issues necessary to protect the park without compromising the well-being of communities overflown by such aircraft. Currently, the voluntary agreement must only address these issues without compromising aviation safety or the air traffic control system.\n\nFurther, the bill amends the public review requirements for a proposed voluntary agreement to require consultation with any community whose lands are, or may be, flown over by a commercial air tour operator. Currently, consultation is only required with any Indian tribe whose tribal lands are, or may be, flown over by an operator."
