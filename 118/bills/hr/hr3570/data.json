    "text": "Comprehensive Response to Fentanyl-Related Substances and Fentanyl-Laced Substances Act\n\nThis bill establishes several programs and requirements to address the use of fentanyl and fentanyl-laced substances.\n\nFor example, the bill expands the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program in the Department of Justice (DOJ) to include training and resources for teachers on how to carry and administer opioid overdose reversal drugs (e.g., naloxone). DOJ must also increase resources and establish an interagency task force for law enforcement agencies to combat the trafficking of fentanyl-laced substances.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must develop a national strategy to prevent the use of fentanyl-laced substances, award grants to state and localities for treatment programs for those who are addicted to fentanyl-laced substances, and research the health effects of fentanyl-laced substances.\n\nThe bill also increases criminal penalties for adulterating or misbranding drugs if the violation results in serious bodily injury or death (imprisonment of up to 10 years, a fine of up to $1 million, or both for violations that result in serious bodily injury, and up to life imprisonment, a fine of up to $5 million, or both for violations that result in death). Penalties are higher for violations that include the intent to defraud or mislead. The bill adds up to 5 years of additional imprisonment if the violation involves drugs that are promoted or sold online."
