This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to remove from the United States non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who knowingly provided false statements related to drug abuse,&#160;drug addiction, or crimes related to controlled substances in an application for admission into the United States.

Upon receiving credible information of such a false statement, DHS must investigate whether the individual should have been barred from admission under specified provisions related to drug abuse and controlled substances. If the individual should have been barred, DHS must initiate removal proceedings within 60 days of receiving the information. The bill provides that an individual removed under these provisions is permanently barred from reentering the United States.&#160;</summary>
