This bill addresses issues related to state and local government cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

A government entity may not prohibit its personnel or another government entity from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts or making inquiries about an individual's immigration status. Currently, a government entity is only barred from prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

DHS may (1) decline to transfer a detained non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) to a noncomplying government entity even if that entity has issued a writ or warrant, and (2) issue a detainer if there is probable cause to believe that an individual arrested for any criminal or motor vehicle offense is inadmissible or deportable. DHS may not transfer an individual with a final order of removal to a noncomplying government entity.

Furthermore, the bill provides legal immunity for a state or local government entity or official temporarily detaining a non-U.S. national under federal authority.</summary>
