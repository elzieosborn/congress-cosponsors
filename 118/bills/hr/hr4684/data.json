    "text": "No Sanctuary for Criminals Act of 2023\n\nThis bill addresses issues related to state and local government cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nA government entity may not prohibit its personnel or another government entity from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts or making inquiries about an individual's immigration status. Currently, a government entity is only barred from prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nDHS may (1) decline to transfer a detained non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) to a noncomplying government entity even if that entity has issued a writ or warrant, and (2) issue a detainer if there is probable cause to believe that an individual arrested for any criminal or motor vehicle offense is inadmissible or deportable. DHS may not transfer an individual with a final order of removal to a noncomplying government entity.\n\nFurthermore, the bill provides legal immunity for a state or local government entity or official temporarily detaining a non-U.S. national under federal authority."
