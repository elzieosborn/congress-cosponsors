It also establishes criminal penalties for related violations.\u00a0\n\nThe bill generally prohibits individuals, political committees, and other entities from distributing such a communication if the communication\u00a0(1) contains materially deceptive audio that is generated by artificial intelligence which impersonates a candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice, (2) is distributed with actual malice, (3) is intended to injure the candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation or to deceive a voter into voting against the candidate, and (4) is distributed within 60 or 90 days of an election (depending on the type of election). This prohibition does not apply to certain entities, such as radio or television broadcasting stations that broadcast the deceptive audio as part of a bona fide newscast.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes a new criminal offense related to the distribution of materially deceptive audio that is generated by artificial intelligence which impersonates a candidate's voice. A violator is subject to criminal penalties\u00e2\u20ac\u201da fine, up to two years in prison, or both.\n\nThe bill requires the Federal Election Commission to (1) promulgate regulations related to this bill, and (2) report to Congress on matters relating to compliance with and enforcement of this bill and recommendations to ensure compliance with this bill."
