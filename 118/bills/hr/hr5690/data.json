However, under current law, HSA distributions are taxable if used to pay otherwise qualified medical expenses incurred after enrolling in an HDHP but before establishing an HSA.\n\nUnder the bill, an HSA that is established within 60 days of the first day of coverage under an HDHP is treated as being established on the first date that coverage begins under the HDHP.\u00a0"
