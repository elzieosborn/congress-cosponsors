This bill authorizes the federal government to pay a foreign air carrier to transport a pet accompanying a federal employee's international travel in certain situations.

Under current law, the official air transportation of federal employees, their dependents, and their property must be purchased from a U.S. flag air carrier (or authorized affiliate), subject to limited exceptions.

Under this bill, if no U.S. flag air carrier is willing or able to a transport a pet accompanying a federal employee's international travel, the federal government may pay a foreign air carrier to provide for the transportation of the traveling employee, their accompanying dependents and property,&#160;and up to three pets. The bill caps such payments at the amount that would have been paid to a U.S. flag air carrier for the same travel and specifies that the federal employee must pay any difference.&#160;

Dogs and cats are covered under this bill, with other animals subject to the approval of the Department of Transportation.</summary>
