This bill establishes the Commission for Review and Correction of Historical Injustices to identify, investigate, and review instances of discrimination and other historical injustices carried out by federal agencies. The commission must also periodically recommend legislative or executive action to resolve such instances.

In carrying out its duties, the commission must set up a mechanism to allow for public comment and input on instances of discrimination.

In addition, the bill grants the commission authority to issue a subpoena to any agency that the majority of the commission deems necessary.</summary>
