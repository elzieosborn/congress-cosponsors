  <summary date="2024-10-23T16:21:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act

This bill excludes the value of employer-funded child or dependent care from being used in calculating an eligible employee's overtime pay.

Under current law, overtime hours must be paid at one and a half times an employee's regular rate of pay. This rate is an average hourly rate that must include certain types of pay, such as commissions. The bill specifies that an employer can provide or pay for child or dependent care services without their value being included in this calculation.</summary>
