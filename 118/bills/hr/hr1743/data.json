    "text": "People Over Petroleum Act\n\nThis bill limits or repeals certain fossil fuel oil and gas subsidies for oil companies and establishes a gas prices rebate for individual taxpayers.\n\nAmong other elements, the bill\n\n repeals the tax credits for producing oil and gas from marginal wells and for enhanced oil recovery; repeals various tax deductions, including the deduction for the intangible drilling and development costs of oil and gas wells; repeals the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and gas property; denies the tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities for oil and gas activities; prohibits the use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting method by major integrated oil companies; limits the foreign tax credit for dual capacity taxpayers (i.e., taxpayers who are subject to a levy of a foreign country or U.S. possession and receive specific economic benefits from such country or possession); and expands the definition of crude oil for purposes of the excise tax on petroleum and petroleum products to include any oil derived from a bitumen or bituminous mixture (tar sands), and any oil derived from kerogen-bearing sources (oil shale). The bill also allows individual taxpayers a 2022 gas prices rebate for the first taxable year beginning in 2022. The bill defines 2022 gas prices rebate amount as the sum of $500 ($1,000 for joint returns), plus $500 times the number of taxpayer dependents who had attained the age of 16 as of the end of the taxable year."
