  <summary date="2023-03-02T15:26:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Keep Huawei on the Entity List Act

 This bill continues export controls on Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and it requires the Department of Commerce to designate Honor Device Co. Ltd. for inclusion on the list of entities subject to certain license requirements for exports.

 The bill prohibits Commerce from removing Huawei (or its subsidiaries or affiliates) from the entity list unless Commerce certifies that Huawei (1) has not engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests and is unlikely to do so in the future; and (2) is not owned, controlled, or influenced by the Communist Party of China.

 Commerce must submit a monthly report identifying and describing all license applications to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) certain items to Huawei or Honor, as well as whether those applications were approved or denied.</summary>
