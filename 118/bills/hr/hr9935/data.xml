This bill provides a new refundable tax credit in the amount of 20% of the cost of manufactured home skirting, up to a maximum amount of $500. Home skirting is any weather-resistant material used to enclose the space between the bottom of the manufactured home and the ground. The tax credit is not available for taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 (or $300,000 for joint filers). Finally, the manufactured home must be used as the taxpayer&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s primary residence.</summary>
