This bill modifies the limit on the amount of financing available to a&#160;Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)&#160;from the Small Business Administration (SBA). It also expands the definition of private capital with respect to SBICs.

Specifically, the bill reduces the&#160;maximum outstanding financing available to an SBIC from 300% to 200% of the SBIC's private capital.&#160;The bill also includes in the amounts that may be excluded from the calculation of the&#160;financing limit the amounts an SBIC invests in small businesses in rural areas or areas of critical technology. The bill revises the&#160;cap on such excluded amounts&#160;to&#160;the lesser of $125 million or the aggregate of 50% of the private capital of the SBIC. The bill indexes the limit to inflation.

Additionally, the bill expands what is considered the private capital of an&#160;SBIC to include funds obtained from the business revenue of additional government-sponsored corporations and funds invested in the trust or endowment of a college or university.

The SBA must report annually on the economic activity and jobs directly and indirectly resulting from the exclusion.</summary>
