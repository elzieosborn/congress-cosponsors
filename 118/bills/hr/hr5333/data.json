It also expands the definition of private capital with respect to SBICs.\n\nSpecifically, the bill reduces the\u00a0maximum outstanding financing available to an SBIC from 300% to 200% of the SBIC's private capital.\u00a0The bill also includes in the amounts that may be excluded from the calculation of the\u00a0financing limit the amounts an SBIC invests in small businesses in rural areas or areas of critical technology. The bill revises the\u00a0cap on such excluded amounts\u00a0to\u00a0the lesser of $125 million or the aggregate of 50% of the private capital of the SBIC. The bill indexes the limit to inflation.\n\nAdditionally, the bill expands what is considered the private capital of an\u00a0SBIC to include funds obtained from the business revenue of additional government-sponsored corporations and funds invested in the trust or endowment of a college or university.\n\nThe SBA must report annually on the economic activity and jobs directly and indirectly resulting from the exclusion."
