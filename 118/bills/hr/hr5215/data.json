(COOL is a labeling law that requires retailers, such as full-line grocery stores, supermarkets, and club warehouse stores, to notify their customers of information regarding the source of certain foods.)\n\nThe USTR must submit a report to specified congressional committees that includes (1) a description of its progress in determining a means of reinstating mandatory COOL for beef, and (2) recommendations for legislation that may be necessary and any engagement with other governments on this matter.\n\nThe USTR must also seek to enter into consultations with the governments of Canada and Mexico to resolve outstanding trade disputes related to COOL for beef."
