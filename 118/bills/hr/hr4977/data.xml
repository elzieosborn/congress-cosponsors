This bill authorizes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)&#160;to provide support to high-income economy countries for developing or processing certain critical materials (such as aluminum, chromium, and rare earth elements). The support must further U.S. national security interests. For the purposes of&#160;this&#160;support, a&#160;high-income economy country is one classified as such&#160;by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association (two World Bank Group institutions).&#160;

Under current law, the&#160;DFC generally prioritizes facilitating private investment in less-developed countries and countries transitioning to market economies to&#160;advance&#160;U.S. foreign policy interests.&#160;
