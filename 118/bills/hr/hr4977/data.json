The support must further U.S. national security interests. For the purposes of\u00a0this\u00a0support, a\u00a0high-income economy country is one classified as such\u00a0by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association (two World Bank Group institutions).\u00a0\n\nUnder current law, the\u00a0DFC generally prioritizes facilitating private investment in less-developed countries and countries transitioning to market economies to\u00a0advance\u00a0U.S. foreign policy interests.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
