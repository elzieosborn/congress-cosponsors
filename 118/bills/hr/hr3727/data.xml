This bill directs the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct a five-year study that evaluates various interventions for reducing stress and supporting the well-being of elementary and secondary school teachers.

In particular, the NIH must implement and analyze the effects of workplace wellness programs, stress management programs, and other types of interventions on teacher stress, retention, and well-being. The NIH must also report to Congress about the results of its study, including any recommendations for reducing stress-related health care costs for teachers.</summary>
