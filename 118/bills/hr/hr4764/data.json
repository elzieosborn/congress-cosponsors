    "text": "Honey Identification Verification and Enforcement Act or the HIVE Act\n\nThis bill directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish a standard of identity for honey based on U.S.\u00a0Pharmacopeia (USP) standards. (USP is an independent, scientific nonprofit organization whose work includes developing and publishing standards for food ingredients.)\n\nThe FDA must submit a report to Congress on enforcement actions taken based on honey that is adulterated or misbranded. (A food is deemed misbranded and may not be sold if it does not meet the FDA-established definition and standard of identity.)\n\nFurther, the bill modifies the Department of Agriculture country-of-origin labeling requirements for honey to require that the countries-of-origin be listed in order of predominance.\n\nThe bill also establishes a requirement for including a certificate, mark, or statement on the label indicating that the honey meets the standard of identify established under this bill.\u00a0"
