This bill authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to independently&#160;bring civil actions to recover penalties for violations of final orders issued by the commission. Under current law, the FTC is required to initially refer these actions to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and may only proceed with such an action if DOJ fails to act.&#160;&#160;&#160;</summary>
