Under the program, the EPA must provide to state and tribal programs (1) grants for establishing licensing programs for persons engaged in assessing and remediating mold, and (2) technical assistance for assessing and remediating mold. The EPA must also administer training seminars on assessing and remediating mold.\n\nThe EPA must also award grants to state and tribal governments for (1) assessing and remediating mold in governmental buildings and private residential properties; and (2) temporary housing for individuals who are severely impacted by mold, are without insurance coverage for mold, and do not have sufficient financial resources to obtain alternative housing. Grants may not be used to assess or remediate mold in housing occupied by households that are high-income."
