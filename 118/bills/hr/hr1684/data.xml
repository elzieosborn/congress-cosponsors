  <summary date="2023-07-20T19:57:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Haiti Criminal Collusion Transparency Act of 2023

This bill requires the Department of State to provide an annual report to Congress on ties between criminal gangs and political and economic elites in Haiti. The bill also requires the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on certain individuals identified in the report if appropriate under specified U.S. laws.

Among other things, the report must (1) identify prominent criminal gangs in Haiti, (2) list Haitian political and economic elites that have links to criminal gangs, (3) assess how collusion between Haitian political and economic elites and criminal gangs threatens the Haitian people and U.S. national interests, and (4) assess what actions the governments of the United States and Haiti could take to address those threats.

The President may waive sanctions in certain circumstances.</summary>
