  <summary date="2024-04-18T18:25:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Providing Relief and Stability for Medicare Patients Act of 2023

This bill temporarily increases the payment rate under Medicare for certain office-based services that involve high-priced equipment.&#194;

Specifically, the bill increases the payment rate under the Medicare physician fee schedule for services provided in a nonfacility (i.e., office) setting for which most of the cost is attributable to equipment and supplies. The increase applies to services furnished in 2024 and 2025.

Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on the correlation, if any, of payment rates for these services under the Medicare physician fee schedule and patient access to these services.
