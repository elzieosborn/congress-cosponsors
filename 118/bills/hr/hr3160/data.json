For each applicable trial, the registry must, among other information, include the total and per patient cost of the trial, as well as costs for personnel, health care services, and other categories of expenditures. Information must be added to the registry within one year of the trial's completion.\n\nThe bill also requires drug manufacturers to include their research and development expenditures for drugs and biological products in annual disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission."
