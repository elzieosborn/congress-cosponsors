The bill also requires these agencies to submit quarterly reports to Congress on grants that the agencies have provided for migrant services programs in Central and South America.\n\nThe reporting requirements and grant prohibitions apply to (1) the U.S. Agency for International Development; (2) the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration; and (3) the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.\n\nThese federal agencies may not give grants to any implementing partners that (1) perform abortions, (2) provide health services that include referrals for abortions, or (3) provide assistance or funding in any manner for obtaining abortions.\n\nAmong other required elements, the quarterly reports for specified migrant services grants shall explain why each implementing partner was chosen, the amount of money the partner received, the availability of asylum claims processing in countries where those partners operate, and the number of asylum claims processed in those countries."
