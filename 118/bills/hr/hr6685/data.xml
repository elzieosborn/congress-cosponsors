This bill&#160;modifies the refundable research tax credit for new and small businesses to (1) provide for an inflation adjustment to the limit on credit refundability; (2) allow refundable amounts to cover all payroll taxes paid by such businesses; and (3) extend eligibility for the credit to small businesses with less than $10 million in gross receipts (currently, less than $5 million).

The bill also increases the rate of the alternative simplified tax credit for such businesses.</summary>
