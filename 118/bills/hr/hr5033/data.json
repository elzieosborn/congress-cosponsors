The report must also describe trends in the data and include\u00a0a discussion of efforts to implement necessary improvements to equity.\n\nIn addition, USDA must use collected data to examine and assess USDA programs and policies to identify and understand communities, organizations, groups, and individuals in need of USDA services or benefits.\u00a0"
