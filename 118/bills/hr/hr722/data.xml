This bill provides assistance for corporations to move operations from China to countries in Latin America or the Caribbean and addresses related issues.

For example, the bill requires the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to provide financing and other assistance to eligible corporations for costs associated with such a move. Tariffs collected for goods manufactured in China shall be used to pay for such assistance.

The President may provide preferential treatment, including duty-free treatment, for goods produced in a Latin American or Caribbean country by a corporation that received relocation assistance under this bill.</summary>
