This bill requires providers of certain imaging services under Medicare to publish their prices online.

Specifically, providers must publish and update at least annually the discounted cash price or gross charge (as applicable) for their services and, if required by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the minimum and maximum negotiated rates between the provider and insurers. The CMS must publish a list of at least 50 shoppable imaging services that are subject to these requirements; if there are fewer than 50 shoppable services, the CMS must include all imaging services on the list. Providers that fail to comply with these requirements may be subject to civil penalties.</summary>
