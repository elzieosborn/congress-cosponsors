This bill requires the Department of Commerce to develop a national strategy for supporting economic opportunity in border communities. The goals of the strategy include increasing the number of jobs in border communities, strengthening U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing, reducing the costs of exports and imports, and increasing opportunities for workforce development.

Border communities are municipalities located not more than 15 miles from a land port of entry. &#160;</summary>
