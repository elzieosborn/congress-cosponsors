  <summary date="2023-06-20T15:56:10Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill addresses the period for the congressional review of termination of certain national emergencies.

Specifically, it requires each house of Congress to vote every six months on a joint resolution to determine whether an emergency declaration shall be terminated. Currently, each house must consider a vote every six months (but not necessarily vote) on a joint resolution to determine whether that emergency shall continue to be in effect.</summary>
