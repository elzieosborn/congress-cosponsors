This bill prohibits a public official or the spouse or dependent of a public official from owning or trading a covered investment. Any official who violates the prohibition is subject to a civil fine equal to the official's salary for each month that the official is in violation.

The bill also prohibits Members of Congress from receiving any outside income or having any outside employment while in office.

Further, the bill revises post-employment lobbying restrictions on former Members of Congress. Specifically, it makes permanent the post-employment lobbying ban on a former Member of the Senate (currently, two years) or a former Member of the House of Representatives (currently, one year).</summary>
