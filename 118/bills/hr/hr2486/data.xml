This bill bans lobbying by former Members of Congress and eliminates certain benefits and services for former Members of the House of Representatives.

Specifically, former Senators, former House Members, or former elected officers of the House or Senate may not communicate with or appear before any Member, officer, or employee of a congressional legislative office seeking action on behalf of any other person, except the United States. (Currently, former Senators are subject to a two-year ban on lobbying, while former House Members and former elected officers are subject to a one-year ban.)

Additionally, former House Members may not access certain benefits and services (e.g., access to the House Chamber, the Members' Dining Room, or parking spaces) unless those benefits and services are publicly available.</summary>
