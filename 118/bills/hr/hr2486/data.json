(Currently, former Senators are subject to a two-year ban on lobbying, while former House Members and former elected officers are subject to a one-year ban.)\n\nAdditionally, former House Members may not access certain benefits and services (e.g., access to the House Chamber, the Members' Dining Room, or parking spaces) unless those benefits and services are publicly available."
