This bill prohibits certain actions by public elementary and secondary schools.

Specifically, the bill prohibits schools from

 compelling a teacher or student to adopt, affirm, adhere to, or profess certain ideas (e.g., that the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist) or any idea in violation of Title IV or Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; compelling a student to observe or espouse obscene or sexual materials without parental consent; instructing or requiring an employee to refer to a student using a pronoun not associated with the biological sex of the student without parental consent; acting as the agent of a parent for purposes of providing verifiable parental consent or receiving a notice or other information required to be provided to a parent; or neglecting to report sexual assault or sexual harassment on school property to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. A parent aggrieved by conduct prohibited under the bill may commerce a civil action against the school.</summary>
