    "text": "Downwinders Parity Act of 2023\n\nThis bill expands a program that compensates individuals who were exposed to radiation from atmospheric nuclear testing and subsequently developed specified cancers.\n\nUnder current law, the program compensates, among others, individuals who were present in a designated geographic area during a period of nuclear testing. The bill expands that area to include all parts of Clark County, Nevada, and Mohave County, Arizona. Current law restricts eligibility to certain parts of those counties.\n\nThe Department of Justice must report on efforts to inform individuals newly eligible for compensation about the program."
