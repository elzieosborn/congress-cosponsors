  <summary date="2023-02-09T22:17:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Rural Telehealth Expansion Act

This bill expands coverage of telehealth services under Medicare to include store-and-forward technologies (in which information is sent to providers and reviewed at a later time, rather than through a real-time interaction). Currently, coverage is limited to federal demonstration programs in Alaska and Hawaii.</summary>
