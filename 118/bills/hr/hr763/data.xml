This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish an Office of Manufacturing Security and Resilience to monitor and respond to disruptions in critical industries and supply chains.

Specifically, the office must (1) monitor the manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, and distribution related to critical supply chains; (2) identify high-priority supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities in critical industries, (3) identify and evaluate the effect of supply chain disruptions on U.S. economic security, and (4) collaborate with other governmental bodies and key international partners to identify opportunities to reduce supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities. The office also must establish a unified coordination group to oversee the interagency response to supply chain shocks and the office must designate certain critical industries, supply chains, and critical goods and services.

Additionally, the office must develop voluntary standards and best practices to reduce the risk of critical supply chain disruption; it also must evaluate the stability and reliability of the agriculture and food system critical supply chain.

The bill includes various program evaluation and reporting requirements.</summary>
