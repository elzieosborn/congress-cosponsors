The office also must establish a unified coordination group to oversee the interagency response to supply chain shocks and the office must designate certain critical industries, supply chains, and critical goods and services.\n\nAdditionally, the office must develop voluntary standards and best practices to reduce the risk of critical supply chain disruption; it also must evaluate the stability and reliability of the agriculture and food system critical supply chain.\n\nThe bill includes various program evaluation and reporting requirements."
