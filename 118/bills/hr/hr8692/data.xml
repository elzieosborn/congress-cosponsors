  <summary date="2024-12-11T13:45:24Z" status="Introduced in House">The&#160;Amtrak Transparency and Accountability for Passengers and Taxpayers Act

This bill directs Amtrak to comply with federal open meeting requirements under the Government in the Sunshine Act (i.e., the Sunshine Act), with exceptions.

Under the bill, certain open meeting requirements do not apply when a majority of the members of the Amtrak Board of Directors meet to discuss official business and (1) no formal or informal vote or other official action is taken at the meeting, and (2) those present at the meeting are board members or board employees.

Under these circumstances, Amtrak must make publicly available&#160;a (1) list of the individuals present at the meeting; and&#160;(2)&#160;summary of the matters discussed at the meeting, including the key issues.

The bill includes an exclusion from these requirements for any matter the board properly determines may be withheld from the public under provisions of the Sunshine Act. If the board properly determines a matter may be withheld from the public, the board must provide a public summary of the matter that includes as much general information as possible.

Further, Amtrak must brief Congress annually on the board's activities.</summary>
