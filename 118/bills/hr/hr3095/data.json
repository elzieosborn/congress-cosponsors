Further, the bill prohibits the President from (1) limiting the application of certain sanctions, or (2) refraining from applying such sanctions pursuant to an agreement unless the agreement is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate as a treaty.\n\nAdditionally, the President must identify and apply sanctions to persons providing significant financial services or material support to (1) the Revolutionary Guard Corps, or (2) persons or entities designated as foreign terrorist organizations or supporting terrorist acts. The bill terminates presidential authority to grant certain waivers to identification and sanctions on December 31, 2025."
