  <summary date="2024-05-31T19:43:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Address Iran's Malign Posture Act

This bill requires the President to (1) submit any agreement with Iran relating to its nuclear program to the Senate for advice and consent; and (2) apply sanctions to foreign persons identified as providing financial or material support to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, foreign terrorist organizations, or supporters of international terrorism.

Specifically, the bill deems any agreement reached between the President and Iran relating to Iran's nuclear program to be a treaty that is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Further, the bill prohibits the President from (1) limiting the application of certain sanctions, or (2) refraining from applying such sanctions pursuant to an agreement unless the agreement is subject to the advice and consent of the Senate as a treaty.

Additionally, the President must identify and apply sanctions to persons providing significant financial services or material support to (1) the Revolutionary Guard Corps, or (2) persons or entities designated as foreign terrorist organizations or supporting terrorist acts. The bill terminates presidential authority to grant certain waivers to identification and sanctions on December 31, 2025.</summary>
