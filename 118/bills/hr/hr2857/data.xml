This bill temporarily requires studies on licensing of health care professionals, mergers and acquisitions of health care entities (e.g., hospitals and health insurance companies), and other matters affecting health care competition and consolidation at the state level.

For 10 years following the bill's enactment, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation within the Department of Health and Human Services must annually carry out the studies. The office must consult with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on the studies.</summary>
