Under the bill, a small farm, ranch, or forest operation (1) is less than 180 acres or meets another USDA-determined, acreage-based definition of small; and (2) has an annual gross cash farm income of less than $350,000.\n\nActivities of the office related to small farms, ranches, and forest operations must include\n\n coordinating USDA efforts to improve support for these operators; reviewing and recommending changes to USDA statutory, regulatory, and administrative provisions, guidance, and policies that disadvantage these operators; providing or coordinating technical assistance for these operators for USDA grant, cost-share, and loan programs; and providing grants of not more than $25,000 to these operators directly or through cooperative agreements with other entities for areas including equipment and infrastructure repairs and upgrades, uninsured losses, business planning, and conservation practice adoption."
