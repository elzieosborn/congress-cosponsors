  <summary date="2024-07-26T18:30:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Brownfields Broadband Deployment Act 

This bill excludes&#160;projects to deploy or modify communications facilities from specified environmental and historic preservation review requirements if they are carried out entirely within a brownfield site (real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant).

In particular, it specifies such projects are not considered major federal&#160;actions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or undertakings under the National Historic Preservation Act. This excludes the projects from relevant reviews that are required under those acts.</summary>
