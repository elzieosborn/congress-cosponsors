An agency's office of the chief information officer may exempt source code from being shared or made publicly accessible to protect individual privacy.\n\nWithin 120 days of enactment, the Office of Electronic Government shall establish minimum reporting standards for agencies relating to certain topics, such as measuring the frequency of reuse of code. Within one year of enactment, the Federal Acquisition Regulation must be revised to implement the act's provisions."
