  <summary date="2024-03-07T18:53:02Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill allows individual taxpayers a tax deduction from gross income (above-the-line deduction) through 2029 for their qualified newborn expenses, up to $5,000. The deduction is not available for taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 ($200,000 in the case of a joint return).

The bill defines qualified newborn expenses to include amounts paid for infant formula, baby bottles, diapers, infant car seats, baby strollers, and cribs.

Taxpayers must include their social security number on their tax returns to qualify for the deduction.</summary>
