Designated congressional election observer refers to an employee of the House of Representatives or the Senate who is designated in writing by the chair or ranking minority member of the House Committee on House Administration or the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration to gather information with respect to an election, including in the event that the election is contested in the House or the Senate and for other purposes permitted by Article I, Section 5, clause 1 and Article I, Section 4, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe act requires states to provide designated congressional election observers with full access to\u00a0clearly observe all elements of administration procedures of federal elections, including access to any area in which a ballot is cast, processed, scanned, tabulated, canvassed, recounted, audited, or certified, including during pre- and post-election procedures.\n\nThe act prohibits such an observer from handling ballots or election equipment, advocating for a position or candidate, taking any action to reduce ballot secrecy or voter privacy, taking any action to interfere with the ability of a voter to cast a ballot or an election administrator to carry out the administrator's duties, or otherwise interfering with the election administration process.\n\nThe act specifies the conduct for which designated congressional election observers may be removed by election officials. In the event of removal, the election official must, within 24 hours of the observer's removal,\u00a0provide written notice to the chair and ranking minority member of the House Committee on House Administration or the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration."
