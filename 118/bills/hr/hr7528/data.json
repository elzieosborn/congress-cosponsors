If the agency publishes only a single copy of a mass comment, the agency also must indicate the number of mass comments submitted that were identical or substantively identical to the representative copy or variation that the agency published.\n\nAdditionally, each agency must establish a policy with respect to the posting and consideration of computer-generated comments and mass-comments during the agency's rulemaking process.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget must issue guidance for implementing the requirements of this bill, and the Government Accountability Office must report on the identification and effect of computer-generated comments in the rulemaking process.\u00a0"
