(Generally, the TRICARE Prime program requires a beneficiary to obtain a referral for care through a designated primary care manager.)\n\nUnder the pilot program, participating female beneficiaries may elect to designate an obstetrical or gynecological care provider under the TRICARE program (i.e., the various programs carried out by DOD, including TRICARE Prime) as an additional designated primary care manager."
