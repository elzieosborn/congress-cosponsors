    "text": "Noise Data Collection Act\n\nThis bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to annually report to Congress the estimated number of individuals in the United States who are exposed to certain levels of aviation noise.\n\nSpecifically, the report must include estimates for the number of individuals exposed to aviation noise at each of the following day-night average sound levels (DNLs): 65 dBA, 55 dBA, and 46 dBA. In addition, the FAA's initial report must include an estimate of the number of individuals exposed to aviation noise at these levels for each year during the period beginning on January 1, 2010, and ending on the last day of the year preceding the year for which the first report is submitted.\n\nThe DNL noise metric reflects a person's cumulative exposure to sound over a 24-hour period, expressed as the noise level for the average day of the year on the basis of annual aircraft operations."
