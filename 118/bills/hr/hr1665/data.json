Public places include any public road or other publicly accessible location, such as parking facilities at public buildings and public parks or publicly accessible parking facilities owned or managed by private entities.\n\nDOT must also develop a publicly available educational program about the health and safety risks related to these types of lithium-ion batteries and how to buy, store, and charge the batteries.\n\nFurther, DOT must conduct a study on the number of uncertified lithium-ion batteries for electric bicycles and scooters that are currently available in the U.S. market. DOT must report on the study and provide recommendations for legislative or regulatory action to ensure the availability of certified and affordable lithium-ion batteries in the U.S. market."
