Federal employees (with the exception of the President and Vice President) are also prohibited from using government-issued devices to engage in any financial trading. The bill's restrictions do not apply to activities that are related to an employee's official duties or Thrift Savings Plan account.\n\nFederal employees who violate the bill's prohibitions are subject to fines, imprisonment (for knowing violations), and disciplinary action."
