This bill prohibits federal employees from conducting any financial trading on federal property.

Specifically, the bill prohibits federal employees, including Members of Congress and the President, from engaging in any financial trading on federal property. Federal employees (with the exception of the President and Vice President) are also prohibited from using government-issued devices to engage in any financial trading. The bill's restrictions do not apply to activities that are related to an employee's official duties or Thrift Savings Plan account.

Federal employees who violate the bill's prohibitions are subject to fines, imprisonment (for knowing violations), and disciplinary action.</summary>
