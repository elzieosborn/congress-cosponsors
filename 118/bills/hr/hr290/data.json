    "text": "Commercial Remote Sensing Amendment Act of 2023\n\nThis bill modifies provisions relating to the licensing of private remote sensing space systems. (Remote sensing refers to the collection of unenhanced data by an instrument in Earth's orbit that can be processed into imagery of surface features of the Earth; private remote sensing space systems refer to remote sensing instruments not owned by the U.S. government.)\n\nThe bill decreases from 120 to 60 days the amount of time in which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must review and make a determination on an application for a license to operate a private remote sensing space system.\n\nFurther, the bill expands annual reporting on the licensing of private remote sensing systems to include a list of all applications, listed by tier, as well as the rationale for each tier categorization (currently, each license is categorized into one of three tiers based on whether the system produces or is capable of producing unenhanced data that is already available from other entities). Additionally, the report must include all terms, conditions, or restrictions placed on licensees.\n\nThe bill also extends the requirement for annual reports from September 30, 2020, to September 30, 2030."
