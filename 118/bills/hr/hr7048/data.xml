This bill addresses federal immigration enforcement issues.

A government entity may not prohibit its personnel or another government entity from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts or inquiring about an individual's immigration status. Currently, a government entity is only barred from prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

A noncomplying state or local government shall be ineligible for certain grants and assistance related to law enforcement, terrorism, and immigration.

DHS may (1) decline to transfer a detained non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) to a noncomplying government entity even if that entity has issued a writ or warrant, and (2) issue a detainer if there is probable cause to believe that an individual arrested for any criminal or motor vehicle offense is inadmissible or deportable. DHS may not transfer an individual with a final order of removal to a noncomplying government entity.

A victim of certain felonies (including murder and rape) may sue a state or local government entity that had refused to honor an immigration detainer request and released the individual who later committed the crime.

Furthermore, the bill (1) expands the categories of offenses requiring mandatory detention, (2) provides legal immunity for a state or local government entity or official temporarily detaining a non-U.S. national under federal authority, (3) provides that an individual may be detained indefinitely while removal proceedings are pending, and (4) restricts a detained non-U.S. national's release on bond.</summary>
