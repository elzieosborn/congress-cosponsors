This bill expands job training and education programs in correctional facilities.

Specifically, the bill authorizes the Bureau of Prisons to provide additional support for occupational education and training programs. The bill requires an annual report that (1) includes a list of programs receiving funding; and (2) analyzes the efficacy of these programs in providing incarcerated workers with valuable job skills, improving their quality of life, and increasing their job prospects upon release.

Additionally, the bill reauthorizes through FY2029 grant programs for (1) evaluating and improving educational methods at prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities; (2) offender reentry demonstration projects; and (3) career training demonstration projects.

The bill also increases the number of prison work pilot projects that may be designated by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.</summary>
