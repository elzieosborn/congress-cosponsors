This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program and recipients of assistance from the program to analyze and report on the program. The DBE program seeks to offer small disadvantaged businesses (i.e., certified as owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals) a fair opportunity to compete for federally funded transportation contracts.

The bill requires

 the DBE liaison officers to track and provide an analysis of all efforts to expand knowledge of services and opportunities available (e.g., minimum outreach, training, and online development support) to non-certified and certified DBEs to increase an enterprise's ability to compete for, and perform on, federally funded transportation contracts; DOT to publicly post online a searchable and exportable version of the Uniform Report of DBE Awards/ Commitments and Payments for each state; and DOT to submit an annual report to Congress on the DBE program.</summary>
