This bill shortens the copyright protection term to 28 years starting from the date the work was originally secured, to be renewable for an additional 28-year term. (Under current law, for works created after 1977, the general rule is that the copyright term lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.)

The bill shall apply to all works fixed on or after the bill's enactment, except that it shall have retroactive effect for copyrights belonging to an entity that (1) is involved in the motion picture or arts and entertainment industries, and (2) has a market capitalization of more than $150 billion.</summary>
