Federal and state agencies may not authorize or renew any such mining until and unless the study concludes that there are no health risks; entities that currently conduct such mining must monitor and report pollution levels associated with such mining until the study's publication.\n\nThe Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement must collect a one-time fee from each entity that currently or previously conducted such mining to cover the federal cost of implementing the bill's requirements."
