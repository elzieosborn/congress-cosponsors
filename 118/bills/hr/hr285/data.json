    "text": "Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to take certain actions with the goal of countering cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency must report on its activities to coordinate disclosures of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The report must address, among other topics, relevant policies and procedures; the degree to which disclosed information is acted upon by industry and other stakeholders; and the preservation of privacy and civil liberties when collecting, using, and sharing vulnerability disclosures.\n\nThe National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center may disseminate protocols to counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities to information systems and industrial control systems, including in circumstances in which such vulnerabilities exist because software or hardware is no longer supported by a vendor.\n\nThe Science and Technology Directorate may establish a competition to develop remedies for cybersecurity vulnerabilities."
