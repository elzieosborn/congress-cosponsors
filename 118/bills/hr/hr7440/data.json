Specifically, the bill allows persons intending to offer a financial innovation to petition specified financial regulatory agencies regarding existing areas of regulation. A petitioner may request a modification or waiver of an agency regulation. The bill sets forth requirements regarding the petition process, a safe harbor for petitioners from enforcement, and enforceable compliance agreements. Agencies must biannually publish a list of financial regulatory areas the agency would consider modifying or waiving through the petition process.\n\nThe bill also establishes Financial Services Innovation Offices at these agencies to assist petitioners. These offices must also generally support the development of financial innovations and coordinate with other offices to share data."
