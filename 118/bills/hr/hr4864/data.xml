This bill limits birthright citizenship to certain individuals, whereas currently, nearly all individuals born in the United States are U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals at birth.

Under this bill, an individual born in the United States shall receive U.S. citizenship and U.S. nationality only if the individual is born to a parent who at the time of the birth is a (1) U.S. national, (2) refugee, (3) lawful permanent resident, or (4) non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) who is performing active service in the Armed Forces.

(All U.S. citizens are U.S. nationals, but some individuals, such as those born in an outlying U.S. possession, obtain U.S. nationality but not citizenship through birth, unless the individual is entitled to citizenship through some other means.)</summary>
