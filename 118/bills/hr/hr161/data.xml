This bill establishes the rate of basic pay for a member of the uniformed services at the minimum amount of $31,200. It transfers unobligated amounts made available to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for enforcement activities to pay for the increase in basic pay.

The bill also prohibits the IRS from hiring additional employees until the increase in the rate of basic pay is implemented.</summary>
