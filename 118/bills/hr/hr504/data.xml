This bill requires federal agencies to provide certain information at the request of additional congressional committees and specifies that agencies must respond to such requests within 45 days.

Under current law, agencies must supply information requested by the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives (or any seven of its members) or the Committee on Government Affairs of the Senate (or any five of its members), provided that the requested information relates to matters within the committees' respective jurisdictions. This bill also requires agencies to supply information requested by authorizing committees or permanent select committees.</summary>
