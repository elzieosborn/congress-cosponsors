Further, the interagency agreement must require the use of a competitive, merit-reviewed process, which considers applications from federal agencies, national laboratories, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit institutions.\n\nResearch and development activities may include\n\n collaborative research in a variety of focus areas, such as integrated natural resources and the energy-water nexus, biofuels and biobased products, invasive species management, grid modernization and security, rural technology development, and wildfire risks and prevention; developing methods to accommodate large voluntary standardized and integrated data sets on agricultural, environmental, supply chain, and economic information; supporting research infrastructure and workforce development; and conducting collaborative research and development on ways to improve agriculture operations and processing efficiencies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
