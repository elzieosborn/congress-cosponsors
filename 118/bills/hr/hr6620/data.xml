This bill prohibits federal funding for any institution of higher education (IHE) that has an endowment&#160;of $5 billion or more. However, such an IHE may receive federal funds for projects or research related to a national critical function. National critical function means a function of government that is so vital to the United States that its disruption would endanger national security or operational control of the southern border.</summary>
