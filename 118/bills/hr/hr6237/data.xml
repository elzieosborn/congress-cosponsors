  <summary date="2024-11-19T16:16:24Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Department of State to establish a program for employees to self-report fiscal waste they observe on the job. The State Department shall investigate such reports and rectify all instances of determined fiscal waste.

Employees must be allowed to make their reports confidential. The State Department must establish a departmental award for any exemplary employee who makes non-confidential submissions to the fiscal waste self-reporting program that result in significant cost savings or the cancellation of wasteful programs.</summary>
