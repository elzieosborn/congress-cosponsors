  <summary date="2023-04-18T16:35:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Public Health Emergency Medical Supplies Enhancement Act of 2023

This bill expands certain authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) to respond to public health emergencies.

Specifically, during a public health emergency, any medical equipment or supplies determined by the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Homeland Security to be scarce and critical materials essential to the national defense may be deemed as such by the President, and funds available to implement the DPA may be used for the purchase, production, or distribution of such medical equipment or supplies.

Further, during a public health emergency, the President and federal agencies may take specific actions to support the production of such materials or supplies, including with respect to supply chains, private-sector coordination, needs assessments, and overall strategies.

The bill provides for enhanced reporting under the DPA during a public health emergency. Additionally, a report required under the DPA for FY2023 and FY2024 shall include the percentage of contracts awarded to small businesses.</summary>
