 This bill allows beneficiaries of ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) accounts a refundable tax credit to match their contributions to such accounts. The amount of such credit may not exceed $2,000.

The bill also requires demographic reporting (e.g., race, gender, disability type) with respect to ABLE accounts and directs the Department of the Treasury to award grants to states for promoting such accounts and for making matching payments of contributions to such accounts.</summary>
