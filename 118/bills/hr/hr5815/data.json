    "text": "Head Start Expansion and Improvement Act of 2023\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2030 and otherwise revises Head Start programs.\n\nSpecifically, the bill expands eligibility for Head Start programs to include families with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level. The bill also adds a definition for public assistance under the Head Start Act to include\u00a0Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); or the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nThe bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a program to make grants to Head Start agencies (including Early Head Start agencies) to construct or improve facilities.\u00a0HHS must also establish and carry out a program to make grants to Head Start agencies for increasing the compensation paid to employees.\n\nThe bill also provides student loan forgiveness for certain Head Start and Early Head Start child care workers. In particular, the Department of Education must cancel the outstanding balance of principal, interest, and fees due on Federal Direct Loans for a borrower who (1) has been employed full-time by a Head Start or Early Head Start program for three years, and (2) has provided care or instruction to children enrolled in such a program."
