This bill further specifies that this access must include access to the campus of the secondary school and that such access must be for the same amount of time that is provided to\u00a0IHEs and prospective employers.\n\nFurther, the Department of Education must annually notify school leaders, school administrators, and other educators about (1) the requirement to allow for military recruitment access, and (2) the actions that may be taken to enforcement this requirement. \u00a0"
