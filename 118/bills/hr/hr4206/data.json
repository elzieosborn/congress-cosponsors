    "text": "Bank Safety Act of 2023 \n\nThis bill requires additional bank holding companies and insured depository institutions (i.e., those with over $100 billion in assets) to use certain information when calculating capital for purposes of meeting risk-based capital requirements. Specifically, these calculations must include certain unrealized gains and losses (i.e., accumulated other comprehensive income), except for accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not recognized at fair value. Currently, only very large institutions are required to include this type of income in their capital calculations, while other institutions are allowed to opt out."
