    "text": "Buy Low and Sell High Act\n\nThis bill revises requirements concerning the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and sets forth provisions to reduce the demand for petroleum fuel and increase fuel supply.\n\nFor example, the bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish within the SPR an Economic Petroleum Reserve of up to 350 million barrels of crude oil.\n\nDOE must also establish a national network of Strategic Refined Petroleum Product Reserves to store up to 250 million barrels of gasoline and diesel fuel, which may be sold when there is a severe fuel supply interruption within the district in which the reserve is located.\n\nIn addition, the bill increases the cap on the amount of barrels of petroleum distillate that may be stored in the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve from two million to four million.\n\nIt also establishes limits on the sale and exportation of petroleum products from such reserves.\n\nFurther, the bill establishes provisions concerning electrifying the transportation sector, zero-emission vehicles, and a program to increase the amount of crude oil refined in oil refineries in certain countries in the Western Hemisphere."
