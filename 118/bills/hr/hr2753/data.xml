  <summary date="2024-02-28T12:57:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Firearms Retailer Code of Conduct Act of 2023

This bill establishes federal statutory requirements and prohibitions related to the sale or transfer of firearms and ammunition by licensed manufactures, importers, and dealers (i.e., federal firearms licensees, or FFLs) in the course of a firearms business.

Among the requirements, FFLs and their employees must complete a training course and be certified in the conduct of firearms transfers. Additionally, FFLs must comply with and display written protocols, maintain general business and liability insurance, and securely store each firearm in their inventory when the business is closed.

The bill prohibits an FFL from transferring a firearm or ammunition to a straw purchaser, a gun trafficker, an individual who is intoxicated, or an individual who is at risk of harming themselves or others. Further, it prohibits an FFL from transferring a firearm or ammunition to an individual not paying in U.S. currency unless the identity of the individual matches the name on the payment method.</summary>
