(Currently, there is no term limit.)\n\nThe bill also removes the cap on the number of Assistant Under Secretaries for Health, and provides that the VA may appoint as many as it determines are necessary. Additionally, the bill removes certain requirements for appointing Assistant Under Secretaries for Health (e.g., the requirement that at least one appointee must be a qualified doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine)."
