This bill modifies certain restrictions on appointments in the Office of the Under Secretary for Health of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Specifically, the bill limits the term of the Under Secretary for Health to five years. (Currently, there is no term limit.)

The bill also removes the cap on the number of Assistant Under Secretaries for Health, and provides that the VA may appoint as many as it determines are necessary. Additionally, the bill removes certain requirements for appointing Assistant Under Secretaries for Health (e.g., the requirement that at least one appointee must be a qualified doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine).</summary>
