This bill requires local educational agencies (LEAs) and institutions of higher education (IHEs) that receive federal education funds to provide the same recruiter access to students for employers in the fossil fuel sector as provided to employers in other energy resource sectors. LEAs and IHEs that violate this requirement are subject to Department of Education enforcement actions, such as withholding of payments to an LEA or termination of an IHE's participation in federal student aid programs.</summary>
