    "text": "Alaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Right to Produce Act of 2023\n\nThis bill provides for oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill nullifies any order or action by the President or the Department of the Interior that places a moratorium on, suspends, or otherwise pauses leasing in ANWR's 1002 Area. It also ratifies and approves all authorizations and permits issued for the establishment and administration of the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The Environmental Protection Agency and other applicable federal departments and agencies must process, reinstate, or continue to maintain such authorizations and permits.\u00a0\n\nWithin 30 days of the bill's enactment, Interior must accept bids for certain ANWR leases that were canceled and reissue the leases. The bill states that the reissued leases must be considered to meet the requirements of specified existing laws, such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nBy December 22, 2024, Interior must also conduct a second lease sale. Further, the bill limits the authority of the President and Interior to cancel future leases issued under the program.\n\nThe bill also directs the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to withdraw its Notice of Availability of the Draft Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. It also nullifies\u00a0(1) BLM's final rule based on the proposed rule titled Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), (2)\u00a0Section 4 of Executive Order 13990, and (3) Secretarial Order 3401.\n\nIn addition, BLM must obtain congressional approval prior to designating any new protected Special Areas, adding resource values to existing Special Areas, or expanding existing Special Areas in\u00a0the NPR-A.\u00a0\n\nFinally, the bill limits judicial review of approvals of leases under the\u00a0Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program."
