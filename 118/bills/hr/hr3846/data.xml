This bill addresses reports conducted by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Specifically, the bill requires the OIG to submit to Congress any report finalized on or after 30 days after the enactment of this bill that substantiates

 a violation of specified provisions regarding prohibited personnel practices, protected communications, or retaliatory personnel actions; a violation of Presidential Personnel Directive-19 (protecting whistleblowers with access to classified information); or an allegation of misconduct, waste, fraud, abuse, or a violation of policy within DHS involving a member of the Senior Executive Service or politically appointed official of DHS. The OIG must make each report publicly available on its website, with exceptions.

The bill requires the OIG's semiannual reports to include specified information regarding

 ongoing audits, inspections, and evaluations; significant changes since the previous semiannual report regarding the narrative description of each such audit, inspection, or evaluation; any such audit, inspection, or evaluation terminated; certain delays; and data with respect to tips and complaints made to the OIG Hotline or otherwise referred to DHS. The OIG must report within one year on the policies, procedures, and internal controls established that ensure compliance with the Quality Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General from the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The Government Accountability Office must evaluate such report within one year after receipt of the report.</summary>
