The OIG must make each report publicly available on its website, with exceptions.\n\nThe bill requires the OIG's semiannual reports to include specified information regarding\n\n ongoing audits, inspections, and evaluations; significant changes since the previous semiannual report regarding the narrative description of each such audit, inspection, or evaluation; any such audit, inspection, or evaluation terminated; certain delays; and data with respect to tips and complaints made to the OIG Hotline or otherwise referred to DHS.
