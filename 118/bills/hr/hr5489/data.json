    "text": "Pell Plus Act of 2023\n\nThis bill establishes the Pell\u00a0Plus program to award an additional Federal Pell Grant (i.e., a Federal Pell Plus Grant), which shall be matched by the participating institution of enrollment, to eligible\u00a0students.\n\nA student is eligible to receive a Federal Pell Plus Grant if the student (1) is enrolled in their first undergraduate course of study at a Pell Plus institution, (2) is maintaining progress toward completion of their course of study in no more than four academic years, and (3) has completed at least four semesters (or the equivalent) of such course of study.\n\nFurther, the bill outlines the requirements for an institution to participate as a Pell Plus institution, including that the institution must notify students whether they are maintaining progress toward completion of their course of study.\n\nThe bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award a Federal\u00a0Pell Plus Grant to an eligible student in an amount equal to the student's Federal Pell Grant award. If the student's combined Federal Pell Grant and Federal Pell Plus Grant exceed the cost of attendance, then ED must reduce the amount of the student's Federal Pell Plus Grant.\n\nThe bill specifies that these Federal Pell Plus Grants must count toward current duration limits."
