This bill requires the Department of Defense to prescribe regulations regarding parental leave policies for members of the Armed Forces across all branches.

Specifically, the regulations must (1) exempt a member from a performance evaluation when such member is taking parental leave that exceeds 31 consecutive days; and (2) authorize a member (without a waiver) to take leave during the two-year period after the birth of a child, adoption of a child, or placement of a minor child in the custody of such member.</summary>
