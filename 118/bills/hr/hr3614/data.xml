  <summary date="2024-06-04T13:53:25Z" status="Introduced in House">American Offshore Wind Opportunity Act

This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study analyzing the policy and regulatory options that could be adopted to&#160; increase the roles of U.S. vessels and mariners in offshore wind turbine installation to meet the goal of developing 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.

The bill requires the study to assess the number of workers needed to crew offshore vessels, the number of workers needed for related jobs (e.g., manufacturing and operating offshore wind projects), the skills required for such employment, and the gaps in the availability of registered apprenticeship programs.

The study must also assess the capacity of U.S. shipyards to build wind turbine installation&#160;vessels&#160;and consider the investments that would best promote the use of a U.S. manufactured fleet of offshore wind vessels.&#160;</summary>
