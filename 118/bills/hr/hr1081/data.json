For the purposes of this bill, a person of concern also includes private companies and individuals domiciled in a country of concern and subject to the substantial influence of the government.\n\nSpecifically, in addition to TikTok and ByteDance, the sanctions shall apply to any social media company\n\n that is based in or organized under the laws of a country of concern; where a country or person of concern owns 20% of its outstanding voting stock or shares; that uses software or algorithms controlled by a country or person of concern, including through export controls; or where a country or person of concern has substantial influence over the company's data sharing or content moderation practices."
