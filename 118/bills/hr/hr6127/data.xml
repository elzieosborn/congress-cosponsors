This bill directs the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to standardize and publish data relating to public outdoor recreational use of federal waterways.

Specifically, the Forest Service and Interior must jointly develop and adopt interagency standards for data collection and dissemination of geospatial data relating to public outdoor recreational use of federal waterways and federal fishing restrictions. The standards must ensure compatibility and interoperability among applicable federal databases with respect to collection and dissemination of such data.

The Forest Service and Interior must also (1) digitize and make publicly available online certain geographic information system data about federal waterway restrictions and federal fishing restrictions, (2) update the information at least twice per year, and (3) develop a process to allow members of the public to submit questions or comments regarding the data.</summary>
