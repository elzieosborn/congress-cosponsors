This bill establishes a tax credit for the hiring of critical employees and makes permanent certain expiring provisions that increase the child tax credit.

Specifically, the bill allows a $3,500 tax credit for the hiring of a critical employee. The bill defines critical employee as a healthcare professional, a law enforcement officer, member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew, a firefighter, an eligible child care provider, or a personal or home care aide. The employer of these professionals must certify that they worked full-time for not less than 75% of the taxable year in their professional capacity and that their primary place of employment for the majority of hours worked during the year is located in a qualified opportunity zone.</summary>
