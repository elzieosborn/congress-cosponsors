An employer also may seek to confirm voluntarily supplied wage history with a prospective employee's current or former employer.\n\nAn employer may not retaliate against an employee or prospective employee who opposes a practice made unlawful by this bill.\n\nThe bill provides for enforcement of these prohibitions through civil penalties and other remedies."
