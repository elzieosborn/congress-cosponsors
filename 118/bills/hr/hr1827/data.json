The bill defines gain-of-function research as any research that could enhance the transmissibility, virulence, or pathogenicity of any pathogen or non-pathogen agent in a way that could lead to (1) moderate or high transmissibility, virulence, or pathogenicity in human populations; (2) significant morbidity or mortality in humans; or (3) severe threats to public health or U.S. national security.\n\nThe prohibition does not apply to the characterization or testing of naturally occurring influenza virus or coronavirus unless the characterization or testing could increase viral pathogenicity or transmissibility."
