This bill requires the Department of Agriculture to award competitive grants to land-grant colleges or universities to increase agricultural producers' voluntary adoption of conservation practices (e.g., alley cropping) and innovative climate practices (e.g., carbon sequestration). Projects may be carried out through public awareness campaigns, workshops, and specialized technical assistance.

Grantees must carry out activities in partnership with at least one other entity, such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a land-grant college or university, a state entity, or a nonprofit organization.</summary>
