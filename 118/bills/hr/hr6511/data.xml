This bill prohibits the U.S. government from charging U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents for their evacuation during the period of evacuation from Israel as a result of the Hamas terrorist attacks.

Specifically, the Department of State must waive repayment for travel expenses incurred on behalf of such an individual as part of the evacuation from Israel. Similarly, no federal employee may solicit or accept funds from such an individual as a condition of using government-provided transportation to repatriate the individual to the United States.</summary>
