This bill requires the President to determine, within 60 days of receiving a request from Congress, whether a person (individual or entity) described in the request meets the criteria to be subject to sanctions imposed in two specified executive orders relating to Russia. The executive orders, dated April 15, 2021, and August 20, 2021, impose sanctions for certain activities including (1) efforts by Russia's government to undermine U.S. elections and democratic institutions, and (2) the construction of specified Russian energy pipelines.

The President must also submit a report to Congress stating whether the President imposed or intends to impose sanctions on any person described in such a request from Congress.</summary>
