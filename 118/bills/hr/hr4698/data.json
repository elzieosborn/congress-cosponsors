    "text": "This bill directs the Department of Agriculture to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study a federal research agenda to advance the understanding of food animal microbiomes (including cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and aquaculture species). The term microbiome generally refers to a community of microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that inhabit a particular environment\u00a0\n\nThe National Academies must submit a report to Congress on the study, including recommendations to advance the federal research agenda on food animal microbiomes.\u00a0"
