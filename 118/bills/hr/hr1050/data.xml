This bill establishes a grant program for data literacy education and requires additional reporting regarding secondary school teachers.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Education to award grants to educational agencies, tribal schools, institutions of higher education, or consortia of such entities for programs to increase access to and support for data literacy, data science, and statistics education. The Institute of Education Sciences must evaluate the grant program within five years after the first grant is made to assess its effectiveness in improving access to data science and literacy.

Additionally, the bill requires the National Center for Education Statistics to collect and report information on the number of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) teachers in secondary schools in each state.</summary>
