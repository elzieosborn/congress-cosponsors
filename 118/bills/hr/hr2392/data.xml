This bill establishes a seven-day waiting period for firearm transfers to unlicensed individuals.

Specifically, the bill makes it unlawful to transfer a firearm to an unlicensed individual unless seven calendar days have elapsed since the transferee's most recent offer to take possession of the firearm. A violator is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, up to five years in prison, or both.

The seven-day waiting period does not apply to certain firearm transfers, such as a temporary transfer for use exclusively at a shooting range.</summary>
