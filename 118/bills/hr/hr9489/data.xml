This bill eliminates the Advisory Committee on the Records of Congress&#160;and transitions&#160;related oversight responsibilities to the Center for Legislative Archives of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and others.

Under the bill, the Center for Legislative Archives must provide an annual report on the management and preservation of the records of Congress during the previous year to NARA, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. The first such report shall be provided&#160;by February 1 of the second calendar year after the bill&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s enactment.&#160;

Further, the Archivist, the Secretary of the Senate, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives must regularly meet to review the management and preservation of the records of Congress and Members of Congress. The meetings must occur within 60 days after the date on which the annual report is provided and within 180 days after the date on which an individual is appointed to the position of Archivist, the Secretary of the Senate, or the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

The committee is eliminated 60 days after the bill's enactment.</summary>
