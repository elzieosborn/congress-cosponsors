This bill requires a state to select two infant formula manufacturers as suppliers under the competitive bidding process for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Specifically, the bill redefines competitive bidding to mean a procurement process under which a state agency selects two manufacturers for a product; a state may designate one of the manufacturers as the primary manufacturer and one as the secondary manufacturer. Currently, a state may only select a single infant formula manufacturer as a supplier.</summary>
