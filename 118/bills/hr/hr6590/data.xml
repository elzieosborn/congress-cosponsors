  <summary date="2024-01-24T23:24:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly Expanded Act or the PACE Expanded Act

This bill modifies requirements regarding Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). PACE is a program under Medicare and Medicaid that provides in-home and community services for certain individuals as an alternative to nursing home care.

The bill allows Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in a PACE program at any time and provides states with the option to allow Medicaid beneficiaries to do the same. Entities may also apply to become PACE providers at any time, upon specified assurances relating to staffing and other requirements.

The bill also (1) allows the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test a model for expanded PACE eligibility that targets high-need and high-cost populations, and (2) requires an evaluation of the effectiveness of PACE in rural and underserved areas.</summary>
