(A state home is a home established by a state for veterans who are disabled by age, disease, or otherwise and are incapable of earning a living because of such disability. The term also includes a home that furnishes nursing home care for veterans.)\n\nUnder the bill, the VA must prescribe a rule that authorizes the waiver of certain requirements for a veteran to be eligible for per diem payments for domiciliary care at a state home if the veteran has met at least four of the current requirements or the waiver would be in the best interest of the veteran.\n\nIn prescribing the rule, the VA must ensure its authority to provide payments to state homes is retroactive to January 5, 2021."
