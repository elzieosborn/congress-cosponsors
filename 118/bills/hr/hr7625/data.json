The board must then assess whether implementing low-carbon investment strategies is profitable and consistent with its duties.\n\nIf the board is unable to find that such strategies would be profitable, the bill establishes the Climate Choice Stock Index Fund as part of the Federal Employees Retirement System's Thrift Savings Plan. This fund is established as an investment portfolio that performs similarly to other plan index funds, but does not invest in fossil fuels.\n\nFinally, the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission must annually report on the economic costs of climate change."
