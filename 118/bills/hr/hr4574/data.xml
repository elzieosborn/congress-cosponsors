This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take various actions to address human smuggling and trafficking.

DHS must seek to expand partnerships with law enforcement in Latin American countries to combat human smuggling and trafficking operations in such countries.

DHS must also seek to expand collaborative programs involving Homeland Security Investigations that are aimed at human smugglers and traffickers targeting children and families that pose border security threats at the U.S. southern border.

The bill also requires DHS to carry out public information campaigns targeting migrant populations in Latin American countries and other countries with high migration rates. The campaigns shall address the dangers of traveling across Mexico to the United States and also combat misinformation and disinformation by nefarious actors regarding U.S. laws or policies.</summary>
