    "text": "The Big-Tech Accountability Act of 2023 \n\nThis bill limits federal liability protection, sometimes referred to as Section 230 protection, that generally precludes providers and users of an interactive computer service from being held legally responsible for content provided by a third party.\n\nSpecifically, the bill removes the protection for providers of social media services (e.g., Facebook and TikTok).\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits a provider of social media services from suspending or otherwise restricting the account of a U.S. citizen based on that citizen's social, political, or religious status. The prohibition applies even if the citizen clearly violates the provider's policies related to hate speech, sexual harassment, discrimination, or violent or threatening speech. A provider that violates the prohibition is subject to civil penalties."
