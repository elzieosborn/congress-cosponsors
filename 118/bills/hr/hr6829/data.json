In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must report on certain research and surveillance activities, and the National Institutes of Health must report on its research relating to cardiomyopathy.\u00a0\n\nThe act\u00a0also establishes a grant program to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training and AEDs in public schools."
