(CFIUS is an interagency committee that oversees the national security risk of certain foreign direct investments in the U.S. economy. It may recommend that the President suspend or prohibit certain transactions.)\n\nFor certain transactions that are pending CFIUS review on the date of this bill's enactment, the President must announce a decision on whether to suspend or prohibit the transaction no later than 15 days after the bill's enactment. Specifically, this requirement applies to transactions where on the date of the bill's enactment (1) more than 105 days have passed since CFIUS accepted written notice of the transaction from one or more parties to the transaction, (2) more than 105 days have passed since CFIUS unilaterally initiated a review, or (3) more than 60 days have passed since a national security investigation was initiated based on the recommendation of a designated lead agency.\n\nThe President must complete any suspensions or prohibitions announced as a result of this bill's requirements within 30 days of the announcement. Additionally, the President must complete within 30 days of the bill's enactment any suspensions or prohibitions announced prior to the bill's enactment."
