  <summary date="2024-09-05T14:26:14Z" status="Reported to House">Modernizing the Congressional Research Service's Access to Data Act

This bill grants the Congressional Research Service (CRS) the authority to secure all forms of records, information, and data directly from the various departments, agencies, and establishments of the executive branch, regulatory agencies, and commissions, as necessary to carry out congressional requests. Such government entities must furnish CRS with such material in a timely manner.

CRS must maintain the same level of confidentiality for such material as is required by law of the government entity from which it is obtained. The bill subjects CRS officers and employees to the same statutory penalties for unauthorized disclosure or use of such material as officers or employees of the government entity from which it is obtained.</summary>
