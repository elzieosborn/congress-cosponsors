This bill places limits on the authority of the Department of Energy (DOE) to prescribe or enforce energy conservation standards for clothes washers. Specifically, the bill prohibits DOE from prescribing or enforcing such standards unless they (1) are technologically feasible and economically justified, (2) are not likely to result in additional net costs to consumers, and (3) will result in significant conservation of energy.</summary>
