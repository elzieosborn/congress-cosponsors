    "text": "Increasing Financial Regulatory Accountability and Transparency Act \n\nThis bill establishes new disclosure, approval, and notification requirements for financial regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).\n\nFor example, FDIC must notify Congress prior to taking action or providing certain assistance to an insured depository institution in receivership that risks serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability. Further, the board must disclose on a more frequent basis information about emergency credit facilities, discount window lending programs, and open market operations.\n\nThe bill requires congressional approval before subjecting a nonbank financial company to enhanced prudential supervision. Currently, the FSOC makes this determination upon an evaluation and vote that requires two-thirds of the council's approval. The bill also eliminates the emergency exception to this authority that allows the FSOC to waive or modify certain requirements.\n\nThe bill establishes qualification requirements for the Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Specifically, an individual must have primary experience working in or supervising insured depository institutions, bank holding companies, or savings and loan holding companies.\n\nFinally, the bill requires specified financial agencies to testify in front of and report to the appropriate congressional committees semi-annually regarding the efforts, activities, objectives, and plans for the supervision and regulation of entities under their supervision."
