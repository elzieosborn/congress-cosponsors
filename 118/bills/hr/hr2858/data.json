    "text": "Restoring Rights of Medical Residents Act\n\nThis bill repeals the antitrust exemption for graduate medical resident matching programs.\n\nCurrently, the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), a private, nonprofit organization, generally matches graduate medical students with residency positions. In 2002, a lawsuit alleged that the NRMP violated federal antitrust laws. The Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 established the antitrust exemption for such programs and the lawsuit was subsequently dismissed."
