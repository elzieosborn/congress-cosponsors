This bill modifies the Veterans Community Care Program to extend the authorization period for emergency treatment furnished by non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care providers. Specifically, the bill authorizes the VA to deem as authorized emergency treatment provided to a covered veteran by a non-VA health care provider if such veteran or provider submits notification within 96 hours (currently 72 hours under VA regulations) of such emergency treatment. Covered veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health care system or those who are not enrolled but are eligible for care due to a service-connected disability.</summary>
