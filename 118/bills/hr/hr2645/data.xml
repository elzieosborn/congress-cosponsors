This bill extends for one year the availability of certain increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Congress authorized temporary increases to SNAP benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are known as emergency allotments. These benefits ended nationwide after the February 2023 issuance. This bill continues that program for one year.

Further, the Department of Agriculture must submit to Congress a strategy plan for state agencies to (1) provide resources and guidance for public awareness of the extension of the emergency allotments, and (2) prepare for the end of this program.</summary>
