This bill changes certain requirements relating to the Federal Pell Grant program for students with disabilities.

Currently, Pell Grant awards are based on enrollment status and a student must attend an institution of higher education (IHE) on a full-time basis in order to receive the maximum award amount. This bill provides an exception for a student with a disability who takes a reduced course load (as determined appropriate by the student's IHE).&#160;Specifically, the bill deems such a student as enrolled on a full-time basis for purposes of calculating the amount of the student's Pell Grant. &#160;</summary>
