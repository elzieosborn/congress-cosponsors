    "text": "Protecting Coasts and Cities from Severe Weather Act\u00a0\n\nThis bill establishes certain programs and requirements to support weather forecasting with respect to coastal flooding, storm surges, and underserved areas.\n\nSpecifically, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must establish a program that improves coastal flooding and storm surge forecasts, such as improvements to real-time predictions of ocean activity. NOAA must evaluate and incorporate innovative observation methods and emerging technologies into the program. NOAA must also improve weather observation in underserved areas, including by identifying challenges to weather observation in these areas and utilizing advanced technology to make changes.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the National Weather Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency must establish a partnership\u00a0to implement pilot projects that support the use of localized weather data in infrastructure and emergency management decisions at the federal, state, and local levels."
