  <summary date="2024-08-19T20:16:19Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill broadens the authority of pharmacies under the Controlled Substances Act to deliver certain controlled substances to health care practitioners for the purpose of administering the substance to a patient.

Under current law, pharmacies may deliver controlled substances in schedules III, IV, or V to a practitioner if it is for maintenance or detoxification treatment and is administered via injection or implantation, among other requirements. The bill applies this authority to any controlled substance in schedules III, IV, or V that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be administered by, or under the supervision of, a practitioner.</summary>
