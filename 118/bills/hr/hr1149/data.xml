  <summary date="2023-04-24T19:06:46Z" status="Passed House">Countering Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act

This bill requires the Department of State to address the use of untrusted telecommunications equipment (and services).

For the purposes of this bill, untrusted telecommunications equipment are those deemed by the Federal Communications Commission to pose an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security.

The State Department must provide support, such as diplomatic and political support, for certain telecommunications infrastructure projects that have the potential to promote U.S. national security interests.

The State Department must report to Congress on (1) the prevalence of such telecommunications equipment in the networks of U.S. allies and partners, and (2) the use of such telecommunications equipment in U.S. embassies and by embassy staff and personnel.</summary>
