 This bill modifies and expands the Health Profession Opportunity Grants (HPOG) program. Specifically, the Administration for Children and Families must prioritize grant applications for demonstration projects in rural areas, and projects must include assistance for the transportation costs of program participants. (The HPOG program provides education and training to low-income individuals for high-demand occupations in the health care field.)</summary>
