This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to hire or designate a Regional Breast Cancer and Gynecologic Cancer Care Coordinator for each Veteran Integrated Services Network (i.e., regional VA health care administrative areas). Among other duties, such coordinators must ensure the coordination of care between VA clinicians and breast and gynecologic cancer community care providers.

Under the bill, veterans are eligible for such&#160;care coordination if they are diagnosed with a breast or gynecologic condition and are eligible for health care through the Veterans Community Care Program.</summary>
