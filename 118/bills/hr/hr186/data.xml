This bill makes the Bureau of Reclamation the lead agency for the purpose of coordinating all permitting and related activities required to construct certain new surface-water storage projects.

Specifically, Reclamation must identify, notify, and coordinate all Federal agencies that may have jurisdiction over a review, analysis, opinion, statement, permit, license, approval, or decision for a qualifying project. A state where a project is being considered may also choose to participate as a cooperating agency.

Reclamation's coordination responsibilities include (1) preparing a unified environmental review document, and (2) maintaining a consolidated administrative record and project data records.

Additionally, Reclamation is authorized to accept and expend funds contributed by a nonfederal&#160;public entity to expedite the evaluation of a permit for such a project.</summary>
