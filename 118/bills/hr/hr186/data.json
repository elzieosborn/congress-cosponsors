A state where a project is being considered may also choose to participate as a cooperating agency.\n\nReclamation's coordination responsibilities include (1) preparing a unified environmental review document, and (2) maintaining a consolidated administrative record and project data records.\n\nAdditionally, Reclamation is authorized to accept and expend funds contributed by a nonfederal\u00a0public entity to expedite the evaluation of a permit for such a project."
