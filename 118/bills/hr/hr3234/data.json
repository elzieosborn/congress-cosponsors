    "text": "This bill requires the immediate expulsion of certain inadmissible non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who arrive at or along the U.S.-Mexico border subject to certain limits.\n\nSpecifically, during the two years starting from this bill's enactment, such a non-U.S. national must be immediately expelled without further hearing or review if the individual lacks proper documentation or committed fraud to gain admission. (Currently, such individuals are typically subject to expedited removal, which includes a chance to request asylum.)\n\nSuch an individual must be expelled to Mexico unless Mexico's government is unwilling to accept the individual or expulsion to Mexico is contrary to U.S. national interest. In such a case, the individual shall be expelled to the country (1) where the individual is a citizen, subject, or national; (2) where the individual was born or has a residence; or (3) that will accept the individual.\n\nAn individual may not be expelled to a country where (1) the individual's life or freedom would be threatened due to certain characteristics, such as race or religion; or (2) there are substantial grounds for believing the individual would be subject to torture. However, this protection shall not apply to an individual convicted of a particularly serious crime or involved with terrorist activities.\n\nAn individual who claims that they be subject to such dangers in a country must meet the burden of proof similar to the burden faced by an asylum seeker in a credible fear determination."
