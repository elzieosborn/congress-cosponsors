The bill defines these as organizations that provide services to individuals with unintended pregnancies with the intent of encouraging the individuals to give birth; the definition in the bill excludes, however, organizations that perform or refer for abortions (or affiliates of those organizations).\n\nFacility upgrades include installing security systems and making the facilities accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nThe bill prohibits the use of grant funds for abortion-related services."
