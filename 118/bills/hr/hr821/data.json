In addition, a social media platform must require all individuals to verify their age by providing a valid identity document (e.g., government-issued identification) or using another reasonable verification method before accessing the platform.\n\nThe platforms must also establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information of users and prospective users.\n\nThe bill provides for enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and private right of action."
