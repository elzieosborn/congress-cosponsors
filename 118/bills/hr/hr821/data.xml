This bill limits access to social media platforms by children and requires all individuals to verify their age before accessing such platforms.

Specifically, a social media platform may not permit children under the age of 16 to access the platform. In addition, a social media platform must require all individuals to verify their age by providing a valid identity document (e.g., government-issued identification) or using another reasonable verification method before accessing the platform.

The platforms must also establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information of users and prospective users.

The bill provides for enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and private right of action.</summary>
