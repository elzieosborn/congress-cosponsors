This bill reauthorizes through FY2028 and modifies the Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment Program. The program provides student loan repayment awards to eligible individuals who provide treatment and recovery support services to patients with a substance use disorder at an approved facility.

In particular, the bill excludes the student loan repayment awards from income for federal tax purposes. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to report on additional aspects of the program, including the number of applications that were denied due to lack of funding.</summary>
