  <summary date="2025-01-13T13:48:39Z" status="Public Law">This act transfers National Forest System land near the Salt River in Arizona to the Bureau of Reclamation to expand the area used for generating hydropower for the Salt River Federal Reclamation Project. Any facilities on the covered land constructed by the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District or the Salt River Valley Water Users&#226;&#8364;&#8482; Association must conform to Reclamation's standards. Once the facilities are substantially completed, Reclamation must take ownership of them. The district and the association must take responsibility for the facilities' operation and maintenance.&#160;

The act also exempts the land transfer from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. It also directs the&#160;Bureau of Reclamation to serve as the lead agency with respect to environmental compliance.</summary>
