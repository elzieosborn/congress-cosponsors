This bill reauthorizes through FY2025 and modifies the Marine Debris Program and makes other modifications to the Marine Debris Act. The bill also reauthorizes through FY2025 the Marine Debris Coordinating Committee and a clearinghouse on marine debris.

The bill modifies the program to allow the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to (1) enter into other agreements, outside of contracts; (2) make in-kind contributions for projects; and (3) receive and expend funds from outside sources for projects.

Next, the bill modifies requirements for the Marine Debris Foundation, including by modifying the process for approving or removing members of the foundation's board of directors. The board must appoint a chief executive officer of the Foundation.

The bill also directs the foundation to locate its principal office in the National Capital Region or a coastal shoreline community.

In addition, the bill requires the foundation to develop best practices for conducting outreach to Indian tribes.</summary>
