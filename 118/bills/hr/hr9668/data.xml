  <summary date="2024-12-12T23:45:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Strategic Homeland Intelligence and Enforcement Legislation to Defend against the CCP Act or the SHIELD Against CCP Act

This bill establishes within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a working group to assess and improve efforts to address security threats posed to the United States by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The threats to be addressed are&#160;terrorist, cybersecurity, border and port security, and transportation security threats.

The working group must examine and report on DHS efforts to counter such threats from the CCP and identify gaps in DHS activities to respond to these threats. The working group must account for the DHS resources dedicated to countering such threats,&#160;build upon existing evaluations, and avoid unnecessary duplication.&#160;The bill requires DHS&#160;to provide Congress with annual&#160;reports and briefings on the activities of the working group.

Further, the bill directs DHS to research and develop technologies and techniques for enhancing DHS's security and situational awareness relating to the threats posed by the CCP.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on the bill's implementation.

The bill&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s provisions sunset seven years after the date of the working group&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s establishment.</summary>
