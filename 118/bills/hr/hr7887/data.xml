  <summary date="2024-07-22T19:15:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Allowing Contractors to Choose Employees for Select Skills Act or the ACCESS Act

This bill prohibits federal agency solicitations from requiring minimum experience or educational requirements for proposed contractor personnel except in specified circumstances. (Solicitations identify agency needs and provide instructions and other information to would-be offerors.)&#160;

A solicitation can require minimum experience or educational requirements if the contracting officer includes in the solicitation a written justification explaining why the needs of the agency cannot be met without such a requirement. &#160;

This bill also requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance not later than 60 days after enactment to federal agencies for implementing this bill.&#160;</summary>
