  <summary date="2023-01-18T20:29:12Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill removes Pakistan's designation as a major non-NATO ally, a status that allows for various benefits such as access to excess U.S. defense supplies and participation in cooperative defense research and development projects.

The President may not redesignate Pakistan a major non-NATO ally without certifying that the country has taken various actions against the Haqqani Network, including continuing to conduct military actions against the Taliban-affiliated group and prosecuting its leaders.</summary>
