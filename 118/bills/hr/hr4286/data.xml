  <summary date="2023-10-18T17:48:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Increasing Access to Lung Cancer Screening Act

This bill provides for coverage without prior authorization requirements of annual lung cancer screenings under Medicaid, Medicare, and private health insurance for individuals for whom screenings are recommended under U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. It also expands Medicaid coverage of counseling and pharmacotherapy for cessation of tobacco use to all individuals, rather than only pregnant women.

The Department of Health and Human Services must conduct outreach on the importance of lung cancer screenings and who should be screened, and the Government Accountability Office must report on the demographics of those diagnosed with lung cancer and recommend ways the federal government can improve screenings.</summary>
