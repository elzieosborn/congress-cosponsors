  <summary date="2023-01-30T15:46:42Z" status="Passed House">Settlement Agreement Information Database Act of 2023

This bill requires executive agencies to submit information regarding settlement agreements to a public database.

Specifically, an agency must submit information regarding any settlement agreement (including a consent decree) entered into by the agency related to an alleged violation of federal law. If an agency determines that information regarding an agreement must remain confidential to protect the public interest, the agency must publish an explanation of why the information is confidential.</summary>
