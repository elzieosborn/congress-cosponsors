This bill allows dogs under six months of age, and dogs without microchips born before the bill becomes law, to be imported into the United States from low-risk countries for rabies. The bill delays the applicability of new requirements on importing dogs for certain government personnel importing dogs from low-risk countries, and for service animals imported from low-risk countries.&#160;

On May 13, 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a rule adding new requirements for importing dogs to prevent the reintroduction and spread of rabies. The rule, among other things, requires that every dog imported into the United States must be at least six months of age and must have a microchip implanted. The bill requires the CDC to revise the rule so that dogs of any age may be imported from low-risk countries for rabies, and so that dogs imported from low-risk countries do not need a microchip if born before the bill becomes law.

In addition, the bill delays the applicability of the rule by 18 months for (1)&#160;members of the Armed Forces stationed in a foreign country, personnel serving at a diplomatic or consular post, and their families seeking to import a dog from a low-risk country; and (2)&#160;individuals seeking to import service animals from low-risk countries.&#160;</summary>
