An accident includes any incident that causes a fire, including a brush fire, alongside a railroad track.\n\nSpecifically, a railroad must report (1) a train accident resulting in damage (based on a preliminary gross estimate) of $150,000 or more to railroad and nonrailroad property; or (2) a train accident resulting in damage of $25,000 or more to a passenger train, including railroad and nonrailroad property."
