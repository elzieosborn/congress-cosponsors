This bill terminates the Department of Education's (ED's) Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.

The bill also repeals applicable programs and statutes with respect to elementary and secondary education for which ED has administrative responsibility. ED must award block grants to each state to make allocations to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on the relative number of children aged 5 to 17 in the school district of each LEA.</summary>
