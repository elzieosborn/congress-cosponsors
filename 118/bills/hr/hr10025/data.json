    "text": "American Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2024\n\nThis bill provides a new refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers and a new tax credit to home builders for the construction of starter homes, both subject to limitations.\n\nFirst-time homebuyers may claim a tax credit equal to the amount of the down payment up to $25,000 (or $50,000 for first-generation homebuyers), subject to income limitations. The amount of the tax credit is reduced based on how much a first-time homebuyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income exceeds $300,000 for joint filers or surviving spouses, $225,000 for head of household filers, and $150,000 for single filers.\u00a0\n\nThe bill requires first-time homebuyers to add the amount received as a tax credit to taxable income if, within five years from the purchase, the house is sold, leased, or is no longer used as the principal place of residence (some exceptions apply).\n\nThe bill also provides a tax credit for home builders of up to 15% of construction costs (materials and labor) incurred to build a home that is no larger than 1,200 square feet and is sold for an amount that does not exceed 80% of the median home prices for the area. The amount of the tax credit increases to 30% if the home is sold to a first-time home buyer.\n\nFinally, under the bill, each state receives an annual allocation for the tax credit for the construction of starter homes, for allocation by the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing finance agency to developers (similar to the administration of the low-income housing tax credit).\u00a0"
