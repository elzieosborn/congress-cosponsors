This bill modifies requirements relating to coverage of telehealth services under Medicare.

Specifically, the bill permanently&#160;extends certain flexibilities that were initially authorized during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19. Among other things, the bill allows (1) rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers to serve as the distant site (i.e., the location of the health care practitioner); (2) the home of a beneficiary to serve as the originating site (i.e., the location of the beneficiary) for all services (rather than for only certain services); and (3) audiologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists to furnish telehealth services.</summary>
