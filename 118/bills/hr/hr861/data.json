An individual who wants to vote by mail may submit such a statement with the ballot.\n\nStates with an identification requirement must make copies of a preprinted version of the statement available for individuals to complete.\n\nAdditionally, states must provide these individuals with a regular ballot instead of a provisional ballot.\n\nThe bill does not apply to first-time voters registering by mail."
