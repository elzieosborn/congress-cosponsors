  <summary date="2024-02-06T14:19:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Spectrum Auction Reauthorization Act of 2023

This bill addresses auctions of, and other matters related to, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum allocated for federal use.

In particular, the bill extends various authorities granted to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction spectrum and specifies the distribution of proceeds from auctions. Further, it increases funding available to the FCC for reimbursing communications services providers for replacing equipment or services that pose national security risks.

It also expands permitted uses and other aspects of the Spectrum Relocation Fund (SRF), a funding mechanism through which federal agencies can recover certain costs for spectrum relocation or sharing. For example, it (1) provides SRF funding to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for implementing incumbent informing capabilities that enable federal spectrum users to alert nonfederal users about where and when federal systems are operating to manage harmful interference in shared spectrum, and (2) directs the Department of Defense to report more extensively about its use of SRF funding.

Additionally, the bill requires activities to (1) expand nonfederal use, shared use, or a combination of those uses of spectrum currently allocated for federal use; and (2) update a memorandum of understanding and otherwise increase coordination to promote efficient and effective use of spectrum allocated for federal use.

 The bill also establishes grants for (1) next generation 9-1-1 systems (interoperable Internet Protocol-based systems for receiving 9-1-1 calls); and (2) expanding broadband access through historically Black colleges or universities, tribal colleges or universities, or other minority-serving institutions.</summary>
