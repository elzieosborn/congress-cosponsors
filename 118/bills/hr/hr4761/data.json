    "text": "Securing American Future from Exploitative Communist Autonomous Research Act or the SAFE CAR Act\n\nThis bill prohibits certain Chinese-manufactured motor vehicles and equipment (or those of a foreign adversary) that do not meet U.S. safety standards from being imported into or sold in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, a person domiciled in China or a manufacturer who is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or the Chinese government may not import into or sell in the United States any motor vehicle or equipment that the Department of Transportation (DOT) determines poses a U.S. security risk.\u00a0\n\nFurther, a motor vehicle may not be granted an exemption from certain safety standards (e.g., for autonomous driving technology testing) if the vehicle manufacturer is under the control of or shares information with the CCP or the Chinese government.\n\nDOT may revoke the existing registration for an exemption for a\u00a0low-volume\u00a0manufacturer if the manufacturer is\u00a0determined to be a U.S. security risk and is owned by, or located in, a country that is classified\u00a0as a foreign adversary.\n\nAn intermediate or final stage manufacturer must also certify (for vehicle safety standard compliance requirements) that (1) DOT has determined that\u00a0the manufacturer is not a threat to\u00a0security, and (2) it\u00a0is not under the control of and does not share information with the CCP or the Chinese government.\u00a0"
