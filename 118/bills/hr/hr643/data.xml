This bill sets out a formula to calculate the number of Members in the House of Representatives, which has been capped at 435 since 1929.

Under the formula, the number of Members is equivalent to the total population of the United States divided by the population of the state with the smallest population (rounded to the nearest whole odd number) and is calculated following each census.

If the formula increases or decreases the size of the House by 15% or more, a temporary congressional commission must convene to make recommendations on the optimal size of the House and the apportionment of Members among the states. The commission must submit its recommendations within six months of the census, and it terminates 30 days after that submission.</summary>
