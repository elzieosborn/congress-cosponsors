This bill requires the U.S. Geological Survey to establish a competitive grant program to fund satellite monitoring of wildfires. The entities eligible to receive the grants are state foresters, emergency managers, and equivalent state officials. Grant recipients must use the funds for purchasing and integrating satellite data on wildfire monitoring, and for using the data to detect and manage wildfires.&#160;</summary>
