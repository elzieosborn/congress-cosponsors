Beneficial ownership information includes the identity of an individual behind a corporate entity.\n\nThe bill extends the deadline for companies to report ownership information to the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Specifically, existing companies must file their initial ownership report within two years (current regulations require the report within one year). New companies must file their initial ownership report within 90 days (current regulations require the report within 30 days). Companies must report updates or changes in ownership within 90 days (current regulations require companies to report such changes within 30 days)."
