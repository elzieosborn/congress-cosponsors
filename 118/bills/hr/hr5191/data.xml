This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a grant program under which USDA may award grants to eligible nonprofit organizations for renewable energy systems, energy efficiency activities, energy storage, smart grids, or microgrids in U.S. territories. In addition, USDA may award grants to train residents of U.S. territories to develop, construct, maintain, or operate renewable energy systems.

The Department of Energy must ensure that its national laboratories offer to provide technical assistance to grant recipients.
