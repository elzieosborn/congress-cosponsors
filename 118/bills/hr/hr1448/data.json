(CFIUS is an interagency committee that oversees the national security risk of certain foreign direct investments in the U.S. economy. It may recommend that the President suspend or prohibit certain transactions.)\n\nUnder the bill, CFIUS must review the acquisition by a foreign government or an entity acting on its behalf of (1) agricultural land used to grow corn and soybeans for the purpose of renewable energy, or (2) land used for wind turbines or other wind energy production. The transfer of an interest in such land to a foreign government or an entity acting on its behalf is likewise subject to CFIUS review.\n\nThe bill also prohibits China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, as well as persons acting on their behalf, from acquiring any interest in these types of land."
