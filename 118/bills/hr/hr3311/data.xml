  <summary date="2024-07-23T18:58:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Coastal Broadband Deployment Act 

This bill excludes projects to deploy or modify certain transmitting devices, towers, antennas, or other communications facilities from specified environmental and historic preservation reviews if the project is carried out entirely within a floodplain (the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland and coastal waters).

In particular, it specifies such projects are not considered major federal&#160;actions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or undertakings under the National Historic Preservation Act. This excludes the projects from relevant reviews required under those acts.</summary>
