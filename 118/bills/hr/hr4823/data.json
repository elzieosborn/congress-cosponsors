Specifically, when proposing or finalizing major rules to conform with recommendations from these organizations, entities must submit to Congress notice, testimony, and a detailed economic analysis with respect to the proposed or final rule prior to its issuance. Additionally, in order to engage with these organizations about climate-related financial risks, entities must report on any participation with the organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities and on the organization's funding sources. Entities must also report on any recommendations received from international organizations for international standardization regarding discount lending and operations or supervisory policies and operations.\n\nThe bill also eliminates the position of Vice Chairman for Supervision from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Currently, the Vice Chairman for Supervision develops policy recommendations for depository institution holding companies and other entities and oversees the supervision and regulation of these entities."
