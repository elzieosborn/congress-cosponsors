A pre-apprenticeship program is designed to prepare individuals to enter an apprenticeship program via education and training.\n\nIn cases where a state does not require any program standards, a pre-apprenticeship program may be treated like an apprenticeship program for purposes of educational assistance if (1) the curriculum of the program is approved and certified by a sponsor, and (2) the program maintains conduct and attendance policies in accordance with a sponsor."
