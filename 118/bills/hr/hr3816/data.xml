This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide the same amount and type of educational assistance to pre-apprenticeship programs as apprenticeship programs in certain circumstances. A pre-apprenticeship program is designed to prepare individuals to enter an apprenticeship program via education and training.

In cases where a state does not require any program standards, a pre-apprenticeship program may be treated like an apprenticeship program for purposes of educational assistance if (1) the curriculum of the program is approved and certified by a sponsor, and (2) the program maintains conduct and attendance policies in accordance with a sponsor.</summary>
