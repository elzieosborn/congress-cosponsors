  <summary date="2023-06-07T15:40:03Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill repeals provisions of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), with specified exceptions. (NVRA established certain voter registration requirements for federal elections, such as the requirement for states to allow individuals to register to vote when they apply for a driver's license and the requirement for states to offer voter registration opportunities by mail-in application.)

The bill retains certain provisions of NVRA, including (1) the requirement that each state must conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters, and (2) criminal penalties for fraudulent voter registration or voting activities.</summary>
