This bill prohibits granting a waiver or license to conduct transactions with certain Iranian individuals and entities unless the President certifies to Congress that the individual or entity has ceased involvement in terrorism.

The bill's prohibition applies to Iranian individuals and entities included on the January 20, 2021, list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons pursuant to Executive Order 13224. (U.S. persons are usually prohibited from transacting with individuals or entities on this list, also called the SDN list, although a license or waiver can allow transactions that would otherwise be prohibited.)</summary>
