    "text": "Campus Free Speech Restoration Act\n\nThis bill addresses expressive activities (e.g., peacefully assembling, distributing literature, or carrying signs) on college campuses.\n\nFirst, the bill generally prohibits a public institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student-aid programs from restricting noncommercial expressive activities on campus.\n\nFurther, the bill prohibits a public IHE from receiving federal funds if the Department of Education determines that the public IHE (1) maintains a policy that infringes upon the expressive rights of students; or (2) maintains or enforces time, place, or manner restrictions on expressive activities, except in limited circumstances.\n\nIn addition, the bill prohibits retaliation against an individual because the individual reported or complained about restrictions on expressive activities or participated in an investigation or hearing.\n\nThe bill also requires a private IHE that receives federal funds to provide students with its policies related to expressive rights.\n\nThe bill also establishes a framework for investigating complaints and for IHEs to regain eligibility for federal funds."
