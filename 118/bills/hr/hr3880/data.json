These prohibited factors include\n\n gender, employment status, zip code, census tract, marital status, and credit score. Automobile insurers must regularly submit to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) information that demonstrates that the insurer's marketing, underwriting, rating, claims handling, and fraud investigations do not disparately impact customers on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, or gender expression. Further, automobile insurers must make underwriting rules and rate filings available to the public.\n\nThe FTC may enforce a violation of these requirements as an unfair or deceptive act or practice."
