This bill eliminates&#160;provisions that reduce Social Security retirement benefits for certain beneficiaries who are younger than full retirement age and who have outside income above a certain threshold, also known as the Retirement Earnings Test (RET).

Under the RET, benefits are reduced for beneficiaries who&#160;are younger than full retirement age if they earn&#160;more than the annual limit ($21,240 for 2023). Withheld benefits are subsequently added to monthly benefits once the beneficiary reaches full retirement age.</summary>
