Generally, the first leaseholder to drill must pay any royalties due to Interior for all oil and gas production on the land subject to the agreement until Interior determines the royalty allocations of each leaseholder. If Interior fails to issue the determination by that deadline, then it must waive interest due on royalty obligations until the end of the month following the month in which the determination was made.\n\nUnder the act, a leaseholder must pay royalties on oil and gas production based on the lessee's proposed allocation of production under the joint agreement until Interior issues a determination of royalty allocations. After Interior issues the determination, then the lessee must correct, if necessary, the amount of royalties paid by the end of the third month following the month in which the lessee received the determination from Interior. Subject to the full and timely payment of monthly royalties in accordance with the agreement,\u00a0Interior must waive interest due on royalty obligations until the end of the third month.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
