Additionally, the bill prohibits federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies from participating in any exchange with the police, military, or security forces of the sanctioned country.\n\nThe bill establishes the U.S. Commission on Atrocity Accountability and Human Rights to review violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law and to make policy recommendations with respect to the imposition and termination of sanctions specified in the bill."
