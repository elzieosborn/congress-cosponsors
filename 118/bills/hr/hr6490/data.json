Currently, the late enrollment penalty is 10% of monthly premiums for each 12-month period during which the individual was not enrolled, and the penalty continues to apply for as long as the individual is enrolled in Medicare medical services.\n\nThe bill also expands the special enrollment periods to individuals who have health insurance coverage other than through their employer."
