This bill directs the Department of Education to implement a demonstration project providing competitive, four-year grants to at least 10 secondary schools that have a four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate of 60% or lower, for the provision of additional school counselors and counselor resources.

The additional school counselors must primarily serve students identified as being at risk of not graduating in four years.

Grantees that demonstrate progress in improving their graduation rates&#160;shall be&#160;eligible for subsequent grants.</summary>
