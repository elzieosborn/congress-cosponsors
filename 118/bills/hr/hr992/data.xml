This bill provides statutory authority for the U.S. Agency for International Development to administer a bicycle mobility program in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.

The purpose of the program is to (1) promote rural communities' access to critical services and opportunities by means of affordable bicycles; and (2) provide support to sustainably increase access to critical services in rural areas, including through support for rural-based mechanics, access to spare parts, and reduction of social and gender-based stigma. To the greatest extent practicable, the program must partner with overseas entities that have successful models for providing access to affordable bicycles.</summary>
