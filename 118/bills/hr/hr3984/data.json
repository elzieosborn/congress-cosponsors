    "text": "Feral Swine Eradication Act\n\nThis bill reauthorizes the feral swine eradication and control pilot program and removes the pilot program designation. This Department of Agriculture (USDA) program responds to the threat feral swine pose to agriculture, native ecosystems, and human and animal health.\n\nThe bill also directs USDA to require the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to continue monitoring an area for reoccurrence of feral swine for one year after USDA determines that feral swine has been eradicated from an eligible area.\n\nThe current even distribution of the program's funds between APHIS and the NRCS is amended to allocate 60% of the funds to APHIS and 40% of the funds to the NRCS.\n\nFurther, the bill includes new reporting requirements, which direct APHIS and the NRCS to submit a joint report to Congress on the program. This report must be publicly available on USDA's website."
