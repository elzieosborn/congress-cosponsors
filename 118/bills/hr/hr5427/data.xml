  <summary date="2023-12-15T22:47:45Z" status="Passed House">This bill prohibits individuals convicted of certain financial crimes from receiving assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA).

Specifically, the bill prohibits individuals who have been convicted of a crime involving financial misconduct or a false statement with respect to certain COVID-19 loans (e.g., Paycheck Protection Program loans, Restaurant Revitalization Fund grants, and Shuttered Venue Operators grants) from receiving any financial assistance from the SBA (other than a disaster loan).

The prohibition includes SBA assistance to small businesses that have an owner, officer, director, or key employee who has been convicted of such a crime.</summary>
