  <summary date="2023-05-18T18:36:30Z" status="Introduced in House">Block, Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act 

This bill creates additional requirements for drug manufacturers and distributors who discover a suspicious order or series of suspicious orders for controlled substances.

Currently, a manufacturer or distributor must report a suspicious order or series of suspicious orders to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). This bill also requires a manufacturer or distributor to exercise due diligence and decline to fill the order. However, if the manufacturer or distributor resolves all of the indicators giving rise to the suspicious order or series of suspicious orders, then the bill allows the manufacturer or distributor to fill the order and choose not to report it to the DEA.

A violation is subject to civil and criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act.

The DEA must issue regulations specifying the indicators that give rise to a suspicious order.</summary>
