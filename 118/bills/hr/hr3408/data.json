    "text": "Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy Safe Integrity Act of 2023 or the DRIVE Safe Integrity Act of 2023\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to promulgate regulations to implement an apprenticeship program for licensed commercial motor vehicle drivers under the age of 21. (The bill expands on the Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program, which allows certain 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old drivers to operate commercial vehicles in interstate commerce if certain training and safety requirements are met.)\n\nUnder the program, an apprentice must complete two probationary periods that total 400 hours of on-duty time, of which at least 240 hours must be driving time in a commercial motor vehicle. Additionally, the apprentice must be accompanied in the cab of the commercial motor vehicle by an experienced driver.\n\nFurther, the bill requires all commercial motor vehicles used in the program for training to be equipped with safety technology such as active braking collision mitigation systems and video event capturing systems.\n\nAn employer shall not knowingly allow, require, permit, or authorize a driver under the age of 21 to operate a commercial motor vehicle unless the driver is participating in, or has completed, an apprenticeship program that meets the requirements set forth in this bill.\n\nDOT must report quarterly on the status of the program."
