This bill denies federal retirement benefits to individuals convicted of child sex abuse.

Specifically, an individual, or a survivor or beneficiary of an individual, may not be paid annuity or retired pay on the basis of the individual's service that is creditable toward the annuity or retired pay (with exceptions) following conviction of (1) aggravated sexual abuse of a child, (2) abusive sexual conduct, or (3) specified related offenses resulting in death.

Further, the bill denies benefits where the individual is under indictment for such an offense and willfully remains outside of the United States for more than one year to avoid prosecution.
