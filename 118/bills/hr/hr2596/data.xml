This bill prohibits utility companies from selling, in any county where a declared major disaster applies, natural gas at a price that (1) is unconscionably excessive, and (2) indicates that the utility company is taking unfair advantage of the disaster to unreasonably increase prices.

The bill provides for enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, including a maximum civil penalty of $100 million for a violation.

In addition, the Department of Justice may bring a criminal action with a maximum penalty of $500 million for a violation.

State attorneys general also may bring a civil action to enforce the prohibitions of this bill.</summary>
