(Under the agreement, Amtrak committed to complying with the ADA and making\u00a0intercity rail stations accessible.)\n\nAmtrak must also include a status report on ADA compliance at Amtrak-served stations (based on a station assessment by Amtrak or the party responsible for ADA compliance).\u00a0\u00a0A\u00a0station assessment\u00a0means a review of all components of a station, including the building, platform, path to train, and parking areas, as required by the\u00a0U.S. Access Board. For those Amtrak-served stations where Amtrak is not responsible for ADA compliance, Amtrak must include in the report information on the responsible party.\u00a0"
