  <summary date="2024-05-28T13:15:04Z" status="Passed House">Think Differently Transportation Act

This bill requires&#160;the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) to include information on&#160;compliance with the&#160;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) in a required annual report to Congress.

Specifically, Amtrak must incorporate into the annual report an action plan for bringing Amtrak rail cars and stations into compliance with the ADA as required by a 2020 settlement agreement entered into between Amtrak and the Department of Justice. (Under the agreement, Amtrak committed to complying with the ADA and making&#160;intercity rail stations accessible.)

Amtrak must also include a status report on ADA compliance at Amtrak-served stations (based on a station assessment by Amtrak or the party responsible for ADA compliance).&#160;&#160;A&#160;station assessment&#160;means a review of all components of a station, including the building, platform, path to train, and parking areas, as required by the&#160;U.S. Access Board. For those Amtrak-served stations where Amtrak is not responsible for ADA compliance, Amtrak must include in the report information on the responsible party.&#160;</summary>
