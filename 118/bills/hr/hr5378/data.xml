  <summary date="2024-01-02T16:04:21Z" status="Passed House">Lower Costs, More Transparency Act

This bill requires health care providers and insurers to disclose certain information about health care costs. It also establishes requirements for certain payment methodologies under Medicare and Medicaid and extends several public health programs.

For example, the bill provides statutory authority for regulations that require hospitals to annually publish their prices and related information, including the discounted cash price and negotiated charges. The bill also specifically extends these requirements to clinical laboratories, imaging service providers, and ambulatory surgical centers that participate in Medicare. Additionally, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) must semiannually report to health plan sponsors certain information on spending, rebates, and fees that are associated with covered drugs. Contracts with PBMs for employer-sponsored health plans must also allow health plan fiduciaries to audit certain claims and cost information without undue restrictions.

In addition, the bill requires pass-through pricing models, and prohibits spread-pricing, for payment arrangements with PBMs under Medicaid. It also requires Medicare payments for certain drug administration services at off-campus hospital outpatient departments to be the same as that for other provider settings (i.e., physician offices).

The bill provides funds for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Treasury, and the Department of Labor to implement and enforce the bill's requirements.

Finally, the bill extends several public health programs, including the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program (through FY2030) and the National Health Service Corps (through December 31, 2025).</summary>
