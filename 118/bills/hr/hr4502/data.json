Agencies may also only consider an applicant's education in conjunction with other minimum qualifications for a position if the applicant's education directly reflects the required competencies for the position.\n\n The bill applies to positions in the competitive service that are classified under the Information Technology Management Series or any other position that is designated as a cybersecurity position under the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management must annually publish on its website (1) any changes to minimum qualifications relating to education for these positions, and (2) data on the level of education of those occupying these positions."
