This bill requires the Department of State to provide Congress with a strategy to improve the processing of passport applications. The strategy must aim to improve communication within the State Department, particularly&#160;among passport offices&#160;regarding passport applications. It must also seek to ensure that the State Department provides updates and responses to inquiries from congressional offices and the public&#160;within a reasonably short period of time.</summary>
