Specifically, Interior may direct those leaseholders to reimburse the United States for costs from (1) processing applications for geothermal leases on federal land, such as applications for geothermal drilling permits; and (2) monitoring geothermal exploration and development activities, including reclamation activities. Interior may reduce the amount of the fee if it determines that (1) the\u00a0full reimbursement would impose an economic hardship on the leaseholder, or (2)\u00a0a less than full reimbursement is necessary to promote the greatest use of geothermal resources.\n\nInterior must use those fees for processing applications for geothermal leases and monitoring related\u00a0exploration and development activities.\u00a0\n\nWithin five years of the bill's enactment, Interior must submit to Congress a report that includes an assessment of how the fees affect Interior's geothermal leasing program and any recommendations for updates to the fees and the program.\u00a0"
