  <summary date="2024-08-15T12:25:35Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill makes tire articles ineligible to receive duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) trade program.&#160;

The GSP is a trade program that provides preferential duty-free treatment for certain products from designated beneficiary countries. Certain products are considered import-sensitive and are specifically prohibited from receiving&#160;GSP treatment. This bill specifically lists tire articles as import-sensitive and therefore ineligible to receive duty-free treatment under the GSP.</summary>
