  <summary date="2024-11-14T19:27:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Rural Outdoor Investment Act

This bill establishes programs that support outdoor recreation and economic development in rural communities.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Commerce to make grants for outdoor recreation projects to spur economic development, with a focus on rural communities. Economic development districts, Indian tribes, states, local governments, institutions of higher education, or nonprofits may apply for the grants.

Commerce,&#160;in consultation with the Small Business Administration and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), must develop a partnership agreement to provide for the development of, among other things, basic training for small businesses and rural communities&#160;relating to existing funding opportunities for outdoor recreation.

Additionally, USDA's Rural Development must partner with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Forest Service to carry out a grant program for developing action plans under&#160;the Recreation Economy for Rural Communities planning assistance program.</summary>
