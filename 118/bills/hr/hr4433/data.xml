  <summary date="2023-10-16T18:33:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Rental Car Consumer Protection Act

This bill establishes protections for consumers reserving rental cars.

Specifically, if a rental car company allows consumers to reserve a vehicle in advance, it must make the vehicle available to the consumer at the reserved location within one-half hour of the reserved time. Rental car companies also must adopt certain reservation procedures and notify consumers of their rights under the bill.

The bill authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to enforce these requirements.</summary>
