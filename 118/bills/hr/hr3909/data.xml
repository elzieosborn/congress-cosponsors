This bill requires certain all-cargo aircraft to be equipped with intrusion-resistant cockpit doors that remain locked while the aircraft is in flight, as directed by the aircraft's pilot in command.

The bill covers new aircraft that have a cockpit door, are manufactured after January 1, 2027, and are used for delivery in all-cargo air transportation with a maximum certificated payload capacity that exceeds 6,500 pounds.

The requirement takes effect on January 1, 2027, regardless of whether the Federal Aviation Administration has issued regulations to implement such a requirement.</summary>
