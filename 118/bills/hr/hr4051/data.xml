  <summary date="2024-02-16T22:22:26Z" status="Passed House">Supporting the Health of Aquatic systems through Research Knowledge and Enhanced Dialogue Act or the SHARKED Act

This bill establishes requirements to address shark depredation (i.e., consumption of a fishing catch by a shark before it is retrieved by a fisherman). Specifically, the bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a task force to identify and address critical needs with respect to shark depredation. The task force must terminate within seven years.

When making funds available under its cooperative research and management program, NOAA must also prioritize projects related to understanding shark depredation.</summary>
