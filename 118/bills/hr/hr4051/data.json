Specifically, the bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a task force to identify and address critical needs with respect to shark depredation. The task force must terminate within seven years.\n\nWhen making funds available under its cooperative research and management program, NOAA must also prioritize projects related to understanding shark depredation."
