  <summary date="2023-11-07T13:50:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Hamas International Financing Prevention Act

This bill imposes sanctions targeting Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and any affiliate or successor groups.

The President must periodically report to Congress a list of each foreign person (individual or entity) that knowingly provides significant support or services to or is involved in a significant transaction with a senior member or supporter of the targeted groups.

The President must impose two or more sanctions on the named persons. Specifically,&#160;the person may be (1) denied credit and services from the Export-Import Bank, (2) barred from purchasing certain controlled defense articles, (3) denied exports of items on the U.S. Munitions List, (4) prevented from receiving exports of certain goods or technology controlled for national security reasons, (5) prohibited from receiving financing of more than $10 million from any U.S. financial institution, or (6) subject to property-blocking restrictions.

The President must periodically report to Congress a list of foreign governments that have repeatedly provided material support for the targeted groups' terrorist activities. The President shall bar these governments from receiving for one year (1) U.S. assistance, or&#160;(2) exports of controlled munitions. The Department of the Treasury must instruct U.S. leadership of&#160;international financial institutions to oppose providing assistance to an identified government for one year.

The bill provides for certain exceptions and waivers, such as for transactions that would serve U.S. national interests.

The President must report to Congress and periodically provide briefings on other specified topics related to the targeted groups, such as where these groups secure financing and surveillance equipment.</summary>
