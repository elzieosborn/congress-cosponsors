 This bill establishes the Federal Infrastructure Bank and the Federal Infrastructure Bank Holding Company (FIBHC). The bank shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of the FIBHC.

The bank must provide equity investments, direct loans, and loan guarantees for the planning, predevelopment, design, construction, operation or maintenance of infrastructure projects in the United States with sufficient revenue sources and guarantees to support the interest and principal payments to the bank. At least 10% of the loans, equity investments, and loan guarantees must be for infrastructure projects in rural areas.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall have oversight and supervisory authority over the FIBHC and the bank. The bank must establish an Infrastructure Guarantee Fund to cover loans and loan guarantees in the event of nonpayment by loan recipients.

The bill provides for a taxpayer credit in an amount equal to 10% of the amount such taxpayer paid to the FIBHC for an equity investment at its original issue.</summary>
