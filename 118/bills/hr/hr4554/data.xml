This bill requires the Offices of the Inspector General in the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development to provide a quarterly report to Congress regarding international assistance to Ukraine.

Among other things, the report must detail (1) the sufficiency of the oversight frameworks in place; (2) instances of fraud, waste, or misuse of assistance; (3) instances where DOD used sole source contracting authority; and (4) recommendations to improve assistance.

The bill authorizes the specified offices to hire employees to prepare the report. The reporting requirement sunsets on January 1, 2030, or when the war and postwar reconstruction efforts in Ukraine end, whichever is later.</summary>
