This bill establishes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity On-the-Job Training Program within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

The program must train DHS employees holding non-cybersecurity positions for work in matters relating to cybersecurity at the department. The curriculum for the program must be consistent with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Framework.

The bill also requires CISA to issue an annual report to Congress describing the number of participants, positions into which participants were hired, and related details about the program.&#160; &#160;</summary>
