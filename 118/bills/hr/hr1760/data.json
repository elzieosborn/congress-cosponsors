Generally, this exemption applies to H-2B workers performing labor (1) related to construction or facility services associated with the military alignment occurring on Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands; or (2) as a health care worker at a facility that jointly serves Armed Forces members, dependents, and civilians on Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands.)"
