  <summary date="2023-11-15T23:40:07Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill extends a provision that removes numerical limits for visas for certain temporary nonagricultural workers working on Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands.

Under this bill, the provision shall apply to qualifying H-2B visa holders who are admitted into Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands before December 31, 2029, whereas currently the provision applies to H-2B visa holders admitted before December 31, 2024.

(The provision exempts qualifying H-2B visa holders from the annual numerical limit on such visas. Generally, this exemption applies to H-2B workers performing labor (1) related to construction or facility services associated with the military alignment occurring on Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands; or (2) as a health care worker at a facility that jointly serves Armed Forces members, dependents, and civilians on Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands.)</summary>
