  <summary date="2024-04-09T10:53:00Z" status="Passed House">Tennessee Valley Authority Salary Transparency Act

This bill expands reporting requirements for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). TVA is a government corporation that provides electricity in Tennessee and in portions of several surrounding states. It also provides flood control, navigation, and land management services for the Tennessee River system.

The bill reinstates and modifies the requirement for TVA to file an annual report with Congress in March regarding its employment structure. (The requirement was terminated by the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.)

The bill modifies the requirement that the report include the total number, names, salaries, and duties of employees earning more than $1,500 a year. Under the bill, this information is only required for employees who (1) are employed at the management level or above (including executives and board members); and (2) are compensated at or above the maximum rate of basic pay for grade GS-15 of the General Schedule.

The bill exempts the information concerning employee salaries contained in the report from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act.</summary>
