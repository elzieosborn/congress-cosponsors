    "text": "Medical Information Nuanced Accountability Judgement Act of 2023 or the MINAJ Act of 2023\n\nThis bill generally prohibits federal agencies from requiring an individual to receive a vaccine unless the required vaccine has been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for at least 10 years.\n\nDuring a declared public health emergency, however, a federal agency may require that individuals receive a vaccine with fewer years of approval or authorization if the agency provides Congress with (1) adequate notice of the requirement, (2) data about the safety and efficacy of the required vaccine, and (3) sufficient time to review the data and deliberate about the requirement. Under the bill, sufficient time for review and deliberation is the lesser of three months or the period of time during which the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions each complete three hearings related to matters in the report."
