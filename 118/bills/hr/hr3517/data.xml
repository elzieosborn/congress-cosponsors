This bill requires each military department to maintain authority over and responsibility for any of member of the Armed Forces under its jurisdiction while a medical evaluation board is considering the member or during any other part of the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES).

The Department of Defense (DOD) must also modify its policies and procedures for the IDES to ensure appeals made by wounded warriors (i.e., members of the Armed Forces being processed for potential medical separation at any point in the IDES) include, at the demand of the member, a full and fair hearing on the determination conducted in a timely manner by the military department concerned.

DOD must brief Congress on the implementation of the modified responsibilities related to the IDES and medical evaluations.</summary>
