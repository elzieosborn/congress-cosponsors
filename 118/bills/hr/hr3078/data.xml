This bill requires issuers of securities to annually disclose to the public information about certain alleged acts of sexual abuse, harassment, or discrimination in the workplace or between employees. Specifically, the issuer must disclose settlements, judgements, and active complaints regarding alleged acts of sexual abuse, harassment, or discrimination as defined by the bill. These disclosures must include the number of settlements, judgements, or active complaints; the number of these that involve acts committed by a corporate executive; the total dollar amount paid out; and the date on which the alleged act occurred.

The bill limits the required disclosure by the issuer if the victim of the alleged act objects to its reporting.</summary>
