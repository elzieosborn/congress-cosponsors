These disclosures must include the number of settlements, judgements, or active complaints; the number of these that involve acts committed by a corporate executive; the total dollar amount paid out; and the date on which the alleged act occurred.\n\nThe bill limits the required disclosure by the issuer if the victim of the alleged act objects to its reporting."
