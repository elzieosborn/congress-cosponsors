The bill applies these requirements to PBMs that contract with private health insurers, and it expands these requirements to include more specific information relating to prices and fees, such as rebates that the PBM receives from drug manufacturers that are not passed through to other entities and the highest and lowest rebate percentages the PBM receives among all its contracts.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to annually post the information reported by PBMs on its website."
