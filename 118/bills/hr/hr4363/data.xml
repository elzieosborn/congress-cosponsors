  <summary date="2024-08-08T20:01:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Comprehensive Cancer Survivorship Act

This bill establishes programs and requirements to support the provision of services for cancer survivors, including health care, employment, and supportive services.

For example, the bill provides for Medicare coverage of cancer care planning and coordination services (i.e., treatment plans that are developed by physicians or other providers). It also establishes grant programs for navigation services for cancer survivors with respect to follow-up services (e.g., screenings) and other support. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must test a model to provide cancer survivorship care planning for children under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The bill also provides for other services and support for cancer survivors, including (1) a grant program to provide employment assistance for cancer survivors, including trainings, transportation, and childcare; and (2) Medicaid and CHIP coverage of fertility services for those with cancer and for cancer survivors.</summary>
