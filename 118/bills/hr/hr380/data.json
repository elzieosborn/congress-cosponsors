This bill prohibits ED from issuing a waiver or modification that (1) provides for a period that exceeds 30 days during which payments of principal or interest due on federal student loans are suspended or interest does not accrue on such loans, or (2) results in the discharge or cancellation of any outstanding balance owed on federal student loans.\n\nFurther, the bill prohibits ED from using this authority to waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to federal student-aid programs in connection with the national emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020, to respond to COVID-19."
