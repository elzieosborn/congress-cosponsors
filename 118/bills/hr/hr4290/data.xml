  <summary date="2024-08-13T11:22:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Acequia Communities Empowered by Qualifying Upgrades for Infrastructure Act

This bill specifies that agricultural producers who rely on acequia systems are eligible to receive assistance under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program for all losses suffered as a result of drought, flood, or other natural disasters. Acequias, or community ditches, are community-operated and -organized water irrigation systems.&#160;

The bill also provides that a special use permit shall not be required on Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Department of the Interior land for the (1) presence or use of water from an acequia,&#160;or (2) routine maintenance and minor improvements conducted by a community user or governing body of an&#160;acequia.

Further, USDA must submit a report to Congress on agricultural producers who&#160;rely on&#160;acequia systems.</summary>
