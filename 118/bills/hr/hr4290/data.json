Acequias, or community ditches, are community-operated and -organized water irrigation systems.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also provides that a special use permit shall not be required on Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Department of the Interior land for the (1) presence or use of water from an acequia,\u00a0or (2) routine maintenance and minor improvements conducted by a community user or governing body of an\u00a0acequia.\n\nFurther, USDA must submit a report to Congress on agricultural producers who\u00a0rely on\u00a0acequia systems."
