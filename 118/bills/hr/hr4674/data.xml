  <summary date="2024-07-18T19:12:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Advanced Nuclear Feasibility Act

This bill directs the Department of Energy to establish a grant program for feasibility studies to site, construct, and operate advanced nuclear reactors (e.g., certain nuclear power plants with significant improvements, such as additional safety features and a lower cost of electricity). Institutions of higher education, private individuals, private companies, or local governments may apply for grants if they are located in a state or territory that has an appropriate plan in effect for furthering the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors. Those states and territories may also apply for grants.</summary>
