    "text": "Streamlining Nutrition Paperwork Act of 2023 or the SNP Act of 2023\n\nThis bill allows state agencies to receive\u00a0Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applications by video phone or a simplified telephonic system.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, a state agency may establish a system to allow applicants who are deaf or hard of hearing (referred to as hearing-impaired under the bill) to sign a submitted SNAP application by gesture over a video phone. (Currently, a state agency may allow for a telephonic signature through a recorded verbal assent.)\n\nThe bill also specifies that, for a video phone or telephonic signature, the current recording system requirement may be satisfied through an audio recording or in writing. (During 2020 and 2021, the Food and Nutrition Service provided waivers to certain state agencies which allowed the state agency to document in writing that an applicant verbally signed the application, instead of requiring an audio recording.)"
