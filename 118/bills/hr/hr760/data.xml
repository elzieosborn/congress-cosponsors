  <summary date="2023-08-09T21:52:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Chinese Military and Surveillance Company Sanctions Act of 2023 

This bill requires the President to impose property-blocking sanctions on companies involved with China's defense or surveillance technology sectors if the sanctions will address threats related to those sectors.

Specifically, if the President determines that imposing sanctions on a foreign person (individual or entity) would address certain threats related to investments in companies in China's defense or surveillance technology sectors, the President must impose sanctions on that person provided that the person is identified (1) as such a company in a specified report to Congress or in a June 3, 2021, executive order, or (2) by the Department of the Treasury as having engaged in transactions in the publicly traded securities (or derivatives) of such a company.</summary>
