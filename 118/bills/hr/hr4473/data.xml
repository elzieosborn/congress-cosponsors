This bill requires payment for cancer care services to be made in the same manner under Medicare regardless of whether they are provided in a hospital outpatient department or physician's office (i.e., site-neutral payment). (Cancer care services are services that are furnished in relation to cancer diagnosis or treatment and that may be provided in either a hospital outpatient department or physician's office for purposes of Medicare payment.)</summary>
