This bill revises requirements concerning oil and gas lease sales under the Outer Continental Shelf leasing program.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of the Interior to allow coastal states to nominate areas off their coasts for oil and gas development.

In addition, Interior must hold at least two region-wide oil and gas lease sales per year in the Gulf of Mexico. Each lease sale must include areas in the Central Gulf of Mexico Planning Area and the Western Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. The bill also establishes deadlines for completing environmental reviews of the lease sales.</summary>
