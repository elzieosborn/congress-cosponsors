  <summary date="2025-08-08T16:02:18Z" status="Public Law">Klamath Basin Water Agreement Support Act of 2024

This act expands the Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2000, including by authorizing the Bureau of Reclamation to implement restoration activities in the Klamath Basin watershed in Oregon and California.

Specifically, Reclamation may plan, construct, operate, and maintain projects in the basin watershed, including

facilities to reduce fish entrainment (i.e., the transport of fish along the flow of water, out of their normal habitat and into unnatural or harmful environments);projects that reduce or avoid impacts on aquatic resources caused by diversion of water for irrigation; andprojects that restore basin watershed habitats, such as tribal fishery resources held in trust.Reclamation may also&#160;

undertake studies and improvements to implement restoration activities in the basin watershed;enter into contracts and agreements with state and local governments, tribes, and private parties to implement restoration activities; andaccept and expend nonfederal funds in order to facilitate the activities.In addition, the act authorizes Reclamation to reimburse Tulelake Irrigation District for up to 69% of the costs for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation Pumping Plant D in Tulelake, California.&#160;

Further, the act provides statutory authorization for Reclamation to implement the 2016 Klamath Power and Facilities Agreement that directs Reclamation to take ownership and operation of the Keno Dam and operation of the Link River Dam.</summary>
