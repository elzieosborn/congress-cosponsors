This bill excludes specified medical debt incurred by Native Americans from credit reports.

The bill applies to medical debt related to treatment authorized by an Indian Health Service facility and performed at a non-Indian Health Service facility and medical debt wrongfully charged by the Department of Health and Human Services. This type of debt must be excluded from a credit report if the medical debt was incurred as a result of services received in the last year or if the debt has been fully paid or settled.&#160;

The bill also establishes a dispute process for such debt.</summary>
