    "text": "Developing and Empowering our Aspiring Leaders Act of 2023 \n\nThis bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise venture capital investment regulations. Venture capital funds are exempt from certain regulations applicable to other investment firms, including those related to filings, audits, and restricted communications with investors. Under current law, non-qualifying investments\u2014which include secondary transactions and investments in other venture capital funds\u2014may comprise up to 20% of a venture capital fund.\n\nThe bill allows investments acquired through secondary transactions or investments in other venture capital funds to be considered as qualifying investments for venture capital funds. However, for a private fund to qualify as a venture capital fund, the fund's investments must predominately (1) be acquired directly, or (2) be investments in other venture capital funds."
