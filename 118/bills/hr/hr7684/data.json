Udall Foundation's trust fund, its Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund, and the foundation's support for training of health care and public policy professionals through the Native Nations Institute. The mission of the foundation, an independent executive branch agency, is to provide programs to promote leadership, education, collaboration, and conflict resolution in the areas of environment, public lands, and natural resources in order to strengthen Native nations, assist federal agencies and others to resolve environmental conflicts, and to encourage the continued use and appreciation of our nation's rich resources.\n\nFor appropriations to the trust fund occurring October 1, 2023, or after, the bill makes interest earned from investments made with those appropriations only available subject to appropriations.\n\nThe bill also directs the Office of Inspector General of the Department of the Interior to complete an audit of the foundation within four years."
