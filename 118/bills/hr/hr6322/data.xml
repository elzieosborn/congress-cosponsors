  <summary date="2024-11-29T17:34:27Z" status="Introduced in House">End Financing for Hamas and State Sponsors of Terrorism Act

This bill prohibits the Department of the Treasury from using its stabilization fund to deal in International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDR) from any country determined to be a state sponsor of terrorism.&#160;(The SDR is an international reserve asset maintained by the IMF based on contributions from IMF member countries. SDRs may be exchanged between member countries and may also be exchanged for currencies.)

Treasury must develop a strategy, in coordination with allies and partners, to ensure that Hamas is incapable of financing armed hostilities against Israel.

Treasury must report to Congress on the major sources of funding to Hamas, with an evaluation of U.S. efforts to undermine Hamas' ability to finance armed hostilities against Israel.</summary>
