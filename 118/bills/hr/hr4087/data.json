(Gain-of-function research is defined as research that enhances the pathogenicity or transmissibility of a\u00a0pathogen in mammals.)\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits federal funds from being used to support gain-of-function research involving\u00a0potential pandemic pathogens by China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, or any other designated foreign adversary. Entities that violate the bill's requirements may not receive any funds from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for three years and, for the following three years, may not receive any additional HHS funds unless they agree to give advance notice about how they intend to use the funds.\u00a0"
