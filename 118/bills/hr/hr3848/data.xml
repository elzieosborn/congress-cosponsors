This bill addresses the funding and administration of certain Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programs related to homeless veterans.

Specifically, the bill increases the maximum rate of per diem payments provided by the VA to entities (i.e., grant recipients or authorized entities) that furnish services and transitional housing to homeless veterans. The bill also authorizes the VA to provide a maximum of 200% of the otherwise applicable maximum rate to a certain number of grant recipients and authorized entities in each fiscal year from FY2024 through FY2026. Under the bill, the VA may not provide more than 12,000 per diem payments in a fiscal year.

Through FY2024, the bill authorizes the VA to use certain available funds to provide specified assistance to homeless veterans who are participating in the Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program. Such assistance may include food, shelter, clothing, transportation for specified purposes, and technology items such as smartphones.

The bill authorizes the VA to collaborate with organizations to manage the use of VA land for homeless veterans to live and sleep.

The bill also extends certain loan fee rates through May 18, 2032, under the VA's home loan program.</summary>
