Further, the President must sanction (1) a foreign person who sells to China or purchases from China any covered item, and (2) a Chinese person who knowingly uses a covered item provided to them in violation of U.S. export control law.\n\nIn addition to a specified list of industries subject to the bill, the USTR must identify certain products from China that either receive designated support from the Chinese government or are used by China to violate human rights or religious liberties."
