This bill imposes reporting requirements relating to abortion drugs.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must require health care practitioners to report (1) any death or adverse event associated with the use of an abortion drug, whether or not the adverse event is considered drug-related; and (2) each time the practitioner prescribes, dispenses, or administers such a drug.

The FDA must establish online portals for health care practitioners to report such information and for patients to self-report adverse events.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must aggregate the collected information and annually publish data about such drugs, including the number of prescriptions and adverse events occurring within 120 days of use.</summary>
