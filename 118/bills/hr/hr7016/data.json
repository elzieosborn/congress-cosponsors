Local consortia refers to partnerships between teacher preparation programs, local educational agencies or individual schools, and community-based organizations.\n\nGrant recipients may use these funds for certain activities, including matching and placing tutors, purchasing instructional materials and connectivity resources, and providing transportation and meals to students who attend the tutoring program.\n\nED must also enter into an interagency agreement with the Corporation for National and Community Service to include tutor positions as approved national service positions."
