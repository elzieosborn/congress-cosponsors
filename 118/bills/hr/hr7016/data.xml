This bill expands access to tutoring in hard-to-staff and high-need schools by establishing a grant program.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive grants to local consortia to carry out high-quality tutoring programs. Local consortia refers to partnerships between teacher preparation programs, local educational agencies or individual schools, and community-based organizations.

Grant recipients may use these funds for certain activities, including matching and placing tutors, purchasing instructional materials and connectivity resources, and providing transportation and meals to students who attend the tutoring program.

ED must also enter into an interagency agreement with the Corporation for National and Community Service to include tutor positions as approved national service positions.</summary>
