The report must include specified elements, including information regarding how many members of the Armed Forces who are participating in the Transition Assistance Program have participated in WARTAC.\n\nThe bill also requires the Veterans' Employment and Training Services within the Department of Labor to establish guidelines containing best practices for departments and agencies that implement programs to employ veterans who are transitioning from service.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of the Interior must implement a two-year pilot program under which veterans are employed by the federal government in positions that relate to the conservation and resource management activities of Interior."
