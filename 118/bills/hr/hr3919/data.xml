This bill prohibits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from taking into account the mental health of a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) when determining whether that individual qualifies as a refugee. (Generally, a refugee is an individual who is unable to return to their country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of certain characteristics, such as race or religion.)

The bill also prohibits DHS from taking into account a non-U.S. national's mental health when determining whether that individual is protected by a provision that generally prohibits removing an individual to a country where that individual's life or freedom would be threatened.</summary>
