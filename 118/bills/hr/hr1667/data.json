    "text": "Ouachita National Forest Overnight Camping Act\n\nThis bill requires the Forest Service to identify and develop campsites and related facilities within the Albert Pike Recreation Area in the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas to be reopened for overnight camping.\n\nOvernight camping within that area has been prohibited since several people died in a major flood on June 11, 2010.\n\nSpecifically, the Forest Service must identify areas within the Albert Pike Recreation Area that may be suitable for overnight camping and select and establish campsites and related facilities for public use within the identified areas.\n\nThe Forest Service must ensure that (1) at least 54 campsites are available, of which at least 8 have electric and water hookups; and (2) each campsite and related facility identified or established is located outside of the recreation area's 100-year floodplain, which is an area that has a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.\n\nNot later than 30 days after the enactment of this bill, the Forest Service shall open each existing campsite within the recreation area that is located outside of the 100-year floodplain."
