The bill requires the President to enter into negotiations with allies and partners (such as Japan, Australia, and NATO members) to prohibit entities in their jurisdictions from using any of these platforms.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires the President to prohibit entities that own or operate a port (or any other critical infrastructure designated by the President) in the United States from using or sharing data with LOGINK or logistics platforms associated with the Chinese government."
