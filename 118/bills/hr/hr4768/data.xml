This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to instruct U.S. representatives to international financial institutions (e.g., the International Monetary Fund) to vote and advocate for such institutions to (1) support projects that decrease reliance on Russia for agricultural commodities, (2) ensure the resilience of global grain supplies, and (3) stimulate private investment in such projects.

This requirement shall be repealed at the earlier of (1) five years after this bill's enactment, or (2) 30 days after the President reports to Congress that termination of the requirement is important to U.S. national interest.</summary>
