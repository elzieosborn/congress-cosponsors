Currently, Interior must hold lease sales at least once every two years. This bill requires Interior to hold a sale at least once a year. If a lease sale is canceled or delayed, then Interior must conduct a replacement sale during the same year. In conducting a lease sale in\u00a0a state, Interior must offer all nominated parcels eligible for geothermal development and utilization under the resource management plan in effect for the state.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn addition, this bill requires Interior to notify an applicant whether or not its application for a geothermal drilling permit is complete within 30 days of receiving the application. If Interior determines that the application is complete, then it must issue a final decision on the application within 30 days of the date Interior sent the notification.\u00a0"
