  <summary date="2024-01-22T15:06:10Z" status="Reported to House">Roll back ESG To Increase Retirement Earnings Act or the RETIRE Act

This bill generally requires fiduciaries of employer-sponsored retirement plans to make investment decisions based only on pecuniary factors (i.e., factors that a fiduciary prudently determines are expected to have a material effect on the risk or return of an investment based on appropriate investment horizons consistent with the plan's policies and objectives).

The bill allows nonpecuniary factors to be considered in certain situations, such as when selecting investment options for certain participant-directed retirement plans or if the fiduciary is unable to distinguish between investment alternatives on the basis of pecuniary factors alone.</summary>
