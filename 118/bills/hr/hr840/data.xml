This bill requires the President to take actions necessary to bar foreign persons (individuals or entities) from purchasing public or private real estate in the United States for the five-year period beginning from this bill's enactment.

The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress (1) certain information on the purchase and ownership of U.S. real estate by foreign persons; and (2) recommendations to make it easier for U.S. citizens and harder for foreign persons to purchase U.S. real estate, including farmland.</summary>
