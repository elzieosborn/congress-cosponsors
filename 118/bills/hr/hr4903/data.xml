This bill expands reporting requirements included in the annual security report provided to current and prospective students and employees of each institution of higher education (IHE).

transportation on foot or via bikes, scooters, skateboards, longboards, or motor vehicles;slips and falls, in the aggregate and from low heights, mid heights, and high heights;alcohol or drug overdoses;choking or drowning;any other specific category of accidents identified by the IHE; andall other accidents.The IHE must also include in the report (1) a description of any plans to address deficient or dangerous facilities on campus that have caused serious physical injury or death; and (2) a statement containing the names, addresses, and distances from campus of the closest trauma centers or other hospitals.

Additionally, the bill changes the name of the report from annual security report to annual campus safety report.

Further, the bill requires the annual report to be published on the IHE's public website. The report must be written and organized in a manner that is easily understandable by students and families.
