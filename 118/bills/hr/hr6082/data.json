    "text": "Emergency Advance Payments Modernization Act\n\nThis bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a pilot program to enhance the delivery of advance payments made through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). FEMA provides advance payment of NFIP insurance claims to certain policyholders who provide documentation before an adjustor inspection. Under the bill, FEMA must use real-time, rapid-monitoring data, including remote sensing data, to increase the speed and amount of such payments. The bill also allows FEMA to use amounts in the National Flood Insurance Fund to forgive any amounts overpaid to a policyholder under the pilot program."
