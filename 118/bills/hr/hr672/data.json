The fee must be 37% of the amount sent.\n\nHalf of the money collected by the fee must be placed in a trust fund for reimbursing border states for expenses incurred for border security enforcement measures. The other half must be placed in another trust fund for (1) deploying technology and installing physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, and (2) paying the wages and salaries of U.S. Border Patrol agents.\n\nIf the amount in the trust funds exceeds a certain threshold, the excess money must be used only for deficit reduction."
