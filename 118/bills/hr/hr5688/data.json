    "text": "Bipartisan HSA Improvement Act of 2023\n\nThis bill allows an individual to contribute to a health savings account (HSA), as part of a high deductible health plan (HDHP), while also participating in a primary care service arrangement, receiving qualified items or services at an employer-sponsored on-site clinic, or if covered under a spouse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flexible spending arrangement (FSA). Further, the bill allows individuals to rollover amounts in an FSA or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) into an HSA.\n\nThe bill defines a primary care service arrangement as one in which an individual is provided primary care services by a primary care practitioner for a periodic fixed fee of no more than $150 a month for an individual (or no more than $300 a month for an arrangement that covers more than one individual).\n\nAdditionally, under the bill, qualified items or services received at an employer-sponsored, on-site clinic include physical exams, immunizations, nonprescription drugs or biologicals, treatment for injuries related to an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment, preventative care for chronic conditions, and vision and hearing screenings.\n\nThe bill allows an individual to contribute to an HSA, as part of an HDHP, even if covered by a spouse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FSA. However, amounts in the spouse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FSA must be used to reimburse the spouse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eligible medical expenses for the plan year before being rolled over into the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSA.\n\nFinally, individuals may be able to rollover up to the annual FSA contribution limit from an FSA or HRA into an HSA upon enrolling in an HDHP.\u00a0"
