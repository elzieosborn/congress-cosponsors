These include costs related to education, training, or licensure and assistance in obtaining overseas academic or training records.\n\nThe bill also makes lawfully present immigrants eligible to participate in the National Health Services Corps (NHSC). The NHSC provides scholarships and student loan repayment awards to health care providers who agree to work in areas with health care provider shortages."
