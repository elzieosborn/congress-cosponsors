    "text": "Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024\n\nThis bill provides continuing FY2024 appropriations for federal agencies. The bill also extends several expiring programs and authorities, including programs authorized by the 2018 farm bill and several public health programs.\n\nDIVISION A--FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2024\n\nFurther Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024\n\n(Sec. 101) This section provides continuing FY2024 appropriations for federal agencies and extends several expiring programs and authorities.\n\nIt is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2024 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires on November 17, 2023.\n\nThe CR provides funding through January 19, 2024, for agencies and programs that were funded in the following four FY2023 appropriations acts:\n\n the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023. For most other federal agencies and programs, the CR provides funding through February 2, 2024.\n\nThe CR generally funds most programs and activities at the FY2023 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs. For example, the CR includes exceptions for:\n\n the Navy's procurement of one Columbia Class Submarine, activities of the U.S. Secret Service that are related to National Special Security Events and the 2024 Presidential Campaign, and activities of the Department of Education that are necessary to ensure the continuation of student loan servicing activities. This section also extends several expiring programs and authorities, including\n\n the U.S. Parole Commission, the authority for the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide physical protection and personal security for certain former or retired DOD officials who face serious and credible threats arising from duties performed while employed by DOD, restrictions on firearms that are undetectable by walk-through metal detectors and X-ray machines commonly used at airports, limits on pay increases for the Vice President and certain senior political appointees, the exemption from the Antideficiency Act for the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, and the Department of Homeland Security's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. This section provides appropriations for a payment to Katherine Anne Feinstein, the beneficiary of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nDIVISION B--OTHER MATTERS\n\nTITLE I--EXTENSIONS AND OTHER MATTERS\n\n(Sec. 101) This section extends provisions that provide grants and other financial assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n\n(Sec. 102) This section extends programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill) until the later of (1) September 30, 2024, or (2) the date specified in the provision of the act.\n\nThis section extends and amends Department of Agriculture (USDA) commodity programs, including by\n\n extending various programs for covered commodities, a loan commodity, sugarcane, or sugar beets for the 2024 crop year; extending the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program through December 31, 2024; limiting the 25% premium discount for the DMC program in 2024 to participating dairy operations that received the discount in 2023; allowing Dairy Forward Pricing Program contracts to be extended through September 30, 2027 (currently September 30, 2026); extending the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) payments through the 2024 crop year for a covered commodity; extending the suspension of permanent price support authorities for the 2024 crop year for covered commodities, cotton, and sugar and through December 31, 2024, for milk; and extending the suspension of provisions related to corn and wheat marketing quotas for wheat planted for harvest in calendar year 2024. This section reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program (SWPP) for FY2024. The SWPP is a joint project with the Farm Service Agency and the National Rural Water Association (a nonprofit water and wastewater utility membership organization), which is designed to help prevent pollution of surface and ground water that is used as the primary source of drinking water by rural residents.\n\nThis section reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program through FY2024.
