This bill specifies that stop-loss coverage is not health insurance coverage for purposes of regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Stop-loss policies are generally obtained by self-insured health plans or sponsors of self-insured group health plans to reimburse the plan or sponsor for losses incurred in providing health benefits to plan participants in excess of a level set forth in the stop-loss policy.

The bill also preempts state laws that prevent employers from obtaining stop-loss coverage.</summary>
