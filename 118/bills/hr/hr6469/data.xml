This bill&#160;authorizes increased civil penalties for violations of the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 (AFIDA)&#160;and increases Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversight of and research into foreign investment in agricultural land.&#160;(AFIDA and the regulations that implemented the act require foreign investors who acquire, transfer, or hold an interest in U.S. agricultural land to report such holdings and transactions to USDA.)&#160;

In general, the bill allows USDA to determine an appropriate civil penalty amount for an&#160;AFIDA violation by removing the cap that currently&#160;prohibits the civil penalty from exceeding 25% of the fair market value of the interest in the land.

The bill provides an exception for a shell corporation (i.e., a corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, trust, or estate that has no or nominal operations). An&#160;AFIDA civil penalty for a foreign-owned shell corporation must be 100% of the fair market value of the interest in the agricultural land associated with the violation. The penalty does not apply if the shell corporation remedies a defective filing or failure to file within 60 days of USDA providing notice.&#160;&#160;

USDA must conduct annual compliance audits of at least 10% of the reports. Further, USDA must provide state and county-level personnel annual training in identifying agricultural land for which a report must be submitted.

USDA must also annually conduct research and submit a report to Congress on foreign investment in agricultural land, including trends in the purchase of U.S. agricultural land by foreign-owned shell corporations.&#160;&#160;&#160;</summary>
