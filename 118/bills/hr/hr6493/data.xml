This bill prohibits federal agencies from using funds made available for salaries and expenses to solicit or enter into agreements with nongovernmental organizations to conduct voter registration or voter mobilization activities on the agency's property or website.

The bill also nullifies Executive Order 14019 (which established requirements for expanding access to voter registration and election information) and terminates any contracts entered into under specified provisions of the order.

Each agency must, within 30 days, submit a report to specified congressional committees that describes the voter registration and mobilization activities carried out by the agency pursuant to this executive order.

The bill also prohibits institutions of higher education that operate federal work-study programs from registering or mobilizing voters on or off campus.</summary>
