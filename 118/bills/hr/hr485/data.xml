  <summary date="2024-02-13T19:48:49Z" status="Passed House">Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act of 2023

This bill prohibits all federal health care programs, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and federally funded state health care programs (e.g., Medicaid) from using prices that are based on quality-adjusted life years (i.e., measures that discount the value of a life based on disability, age, or terminal illness) to determine relevant thresholds for coverage, reimbursements, or incentive programs.

The Government Accountability Office must annually report on how the use of quality-adjusted life years negatively affects individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

The bill also reduces funding for the Prevention and Public Health Fund for FY2024-FY2029.</summary>
