This bill withdraws normal trade relations treatment from China and expands the bases of ineligibility for this treatment to include specified violations of human rights and other actions by China.

Specifically, during any period in which China engages in specified activities (e.g., performing forced abortion or sterilization or operating concentration camps where people are held against their will) or does not comply with certain standards (1) products from China shall not be eligible to receive nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations), (2) China may not participate in any U.S. program that extends credits or credit guarantees or investment guarantees, and (3) the President may not conclude any commercial agreement with China.</summary>
