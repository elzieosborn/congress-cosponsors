    "text": "Stop CCP Fentanyl Act\n\nThis bill imposes sanctions on various Chinese government officials and entities. It also establishes a cause of action against China\u2019s government or Chinese government officials for certain harms stemming a fentanyl-related overdose.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on (1) the president of China, (2) the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), (3) China\u2019s State Council, and (4) China\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee.\n\nThe President may waive the sanctions upon certifying that (1) China\u2019s government and the CCP have taken all reasonable measures to prevent the flow of fentanyl produced in China into the United States, and (2) the intelligence community has determined that amount of fentanyl from China and the deaths resulting from overdoses of such fentanyl has dropped 98%.\n\nThis bill also authorizes a U.S. national or lawful permanent resident to sue certain Chinese government officials or the Chinese government for the death of an immediate family member caused by an overdose by fentanyl (or fentanyl analogue) manufactured using fentanyl precursors from China. Property blocked pursuant to sanctions under this bill may be used to satisfy a judgment from such a lawsuit."
