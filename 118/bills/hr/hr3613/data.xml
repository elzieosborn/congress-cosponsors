This bill permanently authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to directly appoint candidates to positions within the National Disaster Medical System if HHS determines the number of personnel in the system is insufficient to address a public health emergency or potential public health emergency. Currently, the authorization expires on September 30, 2023.

The National Disaster Medical System is a partnership between HHS, the Department of Defense, and other federal departments that responds to public health and other emergencies, including by deploying medical response teams.</summary>
