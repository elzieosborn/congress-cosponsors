This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a strategy and carry out a specific initiative to prevent and reduce the use of electronic cigarettes and emerging tobacco products among youth and young adults.

As part of the initiative, the CDC must

 conduct research and surveillance on types of products, patterns of use, health impacts, and other aspects of the use of such products by youth and young adults; evaluate prevention and intervention strategies and develop guidance for intervening and treating youth and young adults who use such products; identify effective messaging and communication efforts and implement a national public education campaign concerning the use of such products; and continue to fund grants for tobacco control programs in health departments, including efforts to prevent and reduce the use of such products by youth and young adults.</summary>
