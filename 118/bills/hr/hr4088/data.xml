This bill reauthorizes through FY2028 the Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support Grant Program, which supports the ability of individuals who are in substance-use disorder treatment and recovery to live independently and participate in the workforce.&#160;

The bill also specifies that the data used to determine which states to prioritize for grants (e.g., overdose mortality rates and unemployment rates) must be based on the five-year period immediately preceding the grant cycle. It also allows grants to be used for transportation services to and from the individual's work, training, or treatment or recovery services.</summary>
