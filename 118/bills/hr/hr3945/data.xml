This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue a final rule on safety management systems (SMS) for certain certificate holders and operators. (An SMS is a formal, organization-wide approach to safety risk that includes systematic procedures, practices, and policies.)

The FAA issued an SMS notice of proposed rulemaking on January 11, 2023. Specifically, the bill requires the FAA to ensure the final SMS rule applies to all specified certificate holders and operators, including commuter and on-demand operators and commercial air tour operators.</summary>
