    "text": "Farmer to Farmer Education Act of 2024\n\nThis bill expands the authority of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide technical assistance for farmer-to-farmer networks. A farmer-to-farmer network means any affiliation or association of farmers that share information, technical assistance, or any other type of mutually beneficial support.\n\nUnder the bill, USDA may enter into cooperative agreements with eligible entities to provide assistance to farmer-to-farmer networks to (1) build network capacity, connect farmers with mentors or group learning opportunities, and support goal setting; (2) increase technical assistance for farmers, ranchers, and forest owners who use different farming models, practices, and scales; and (3) establish and steward the networks.\n\nThose eligible for the program include nonprofit entities, farmer-to-farmer networks, tribal entities, local governments, institutions of higher education, and states. USDA must prioritize\u00a0agreements with entities that seek to meet the specific needs of certain farmers, ranchers, and forest owners who are historically underserved or operating in high-poverty areas.\n\nThe bill also provides for subawards to plan and conduct events, as well as to identify and develop innovative activities, in order to increase farmer access to farmer-to-farmer assistance. USDA and the Natural Resources Conservation Service must establish any necessary additional requirements for subawards."
