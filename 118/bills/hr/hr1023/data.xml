This bill repeals certain programs for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Specifically, it repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which provides financial and technical assistance to states and other eligible recipients to help communities reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition, the bill eliminates a program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that provides incentives for petroleum and natural gas systems to reduce their emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases. It also repeals a charge on methane emissions from specific types of facilities that are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program.</summary>
