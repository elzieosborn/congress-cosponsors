    "text": "National Telecommunications and Information Administration Reauthorization Act of 2023 or the NTIA Reauthorization Act of 2023\n\nThis bill reauthorizes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) through FY2025 and modifies its structure and functions.\n\nSpecifically, the bill promotes the head of the NTIA to an Under Secretary of the Department of Commerce. It also provides statutory authority for two NTIA offices focused on public safety communications and international telecommunications policy, respectively.\n\nFurther, the bill provides statutory authority for the NTIA Office of Spectrum Management and otherwise revises the management of spectrum resources (electromagnetic frequencies used to transmit signals and data, including wireless internet). For example, the bill (1) sets out procedures for disclosing federal concerns and related information regarding spectrum actions, and (2) requires the NTIA to develop technologies and carry out other activities to enhance efficiency in the use of spectrum resources and facilitate sharing of the resources.\n\nIn addition, the bill expands the role of the NTIA with respect to cybersecurity. This includes requiring the NTIA to\n\n carry out a cybersecurity literacy campaign, report on the information and communications technology supply chain and the cybersecurity of mobile networks, and provide technical assistance and outreach to small communications providers concerning Open RAN networks and other open network architectures. The NTIA also must (1) develop and implement a strategy to close the digital divide, and (2) establish an interagency process (that replaces the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications Services Sector, formerly known as Team Telecom) to consider the law enforcement and national security implications of foreign ownership interests when licensing or authorizing telecommunications systems and infrastructure."
