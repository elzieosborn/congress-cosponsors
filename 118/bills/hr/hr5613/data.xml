This bill requires the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Defense to notify each other when placing a foreign individual or entity on specified sanctions lists. Each department receiving a notification must conduct a review and determine whether to place such individual or entity on the lists under department responsibility. If a receiving department determines that the individual or entity does not belong on the department's lists, it must report the determination and reasons to Congress.

Each of the departments must also notify Congress when it first considers placing an individual or entity on a list but determines not to place the individual or entity on the list.</summary>
