The current weight limit is 80,000 pounds. A stinger-steered combination automobile transporter is a truck tractor semitrailer wherein the fifth wheel is located on a drop frame located behind and below the rear-most axle of the power unit.\n\nFurther, a state is prohibited from enacting or enforcing a law that denies these automobile transporters reasonable access from highways to loading or unloading points or facilities for food, fuel, repair, and rest.\u00a0"
