This bill limits the information allowed to be shared on credit reports and considered in housing decisions, including certain criminal background information.

First, the bill prohibits a consumer reporting agency from including specified information on a consumer credit report provided for tenant screening purposes, such as arrests, juvenile adjudications or convictions, civil citations, resolved criminal cases (e.g., through completion of a diversion program), and convictions with completed sentences.

Further, the bill restricts the use of consumer credit reports for tenant screening. A person who obtains such a report must not use it in violation of fair housing laws and must disclose its use to the consumer. When taking adverse action based on the report, a person must provide the consumer with a copy of the report, the specific reasons for the adverse action, and other information.

The bill also specifies that upon request, consumer reporting agencies must disclose to a consumer the entity that is the source of any information on a consumer credit report.

Finally, the bill excludes from consumer credit reports criminal convictions older than seven years.</summary>
