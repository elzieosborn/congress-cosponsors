  <summary date="2023-03-17T14:49:17Z" status="Passed House">Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act

This bill generally prohibits federal employees from censoring the speech of others while acting in an official capacity.

Specifically, the bill prohibits employees of executive agencies or who are otherwise in the competitive service from (1) using their official authority to censor a private entity; or (2) engaging in censorship of a private entity while on duty, wearing a uniform, or using official government property. The bill provides certain exceptions for law enforcement, subject to specified reporting requirements.

Employees are subject to disciplinary action, civil penalties, or both for violations.

The bill defines censor or censorship to mean influencing or coercing, or directing another to influence or coerce, for the removal of lawful speech, the addition of disclaimers, or the restriction of access with respect to any interactive computer service (e.g., social media).</summary>
