The bill provides certain exceptions for law enforcement, subject to specified reporting requirements.\n\nEmployees are subject to disciplinary action, civil penalties, or both for violations.\n\nThe bill defines censor or censorship to mean influencing or coercing, or directing another to influence or coerce, for the removal of lawful speech, the addition of disclaimers, or the restriction of access with respect to any interactive computer service (e.g., social media)."
