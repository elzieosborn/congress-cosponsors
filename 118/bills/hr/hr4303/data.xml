  <summary date="2024-08-13T20:28:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Abortion Justice Act of 2023

This bill establishes rights, requirements, and programs with the purpose of increasing access to abortion care.

The bill specifies that all persons have a fundamental right to make decisions regarding abortions and miscarriages and prohibits federal, state, and local governments from denying, or otherwise penalizing an individual for exercising, that right. Aggrieved individuals may sue governments for violating these prohibitions.

Additionally, the bill eliminates language that allows health care entities to decline to offer training related to, performance of, or referrals for abortion care, and generally requires that all federally funded health care providers offer patients all medically appropriate reproductive care, including abortion care.

It also (1) requires public and private health insurance plans to cover abortion services, (2) prohibits immigration enforcement actions within 2,000 feet of any health care facility, and (3) establishes a grant program to increase access to abortion services.</summary>
