This bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adjust annually for inflation the dollar amount of an exemption from registration requirements for investment advisors of private funds. Currently, investment advisors of private funds of less than $150 million in assets under management are exempt. The bill would require the SEC to adjust that amount annually based on the change in the Consumer Price Index.</summary>
