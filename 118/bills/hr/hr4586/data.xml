This bill expands the eligible programs under the AgrAbility grant program of the Department of Agriculture and reauthorizes the program through FY2033. (AgrAbility provides direct education and assistance to farmers and family members with disabilities.)

The bill specifies that grants may be used to initiate, expand, or sustain programs that provide education and support to youth and young adults with disabilities interested in farming and farm-related occupations.

The bill also provides that the maximum grant award under the program is $260,000. Current law specifies a minimum grant award amount of $150,000, but does not include&#160;a maximum amount.&#160;</summary>
