    "text": "Improving Crowdfunding Opportunities Act \n\nThis bill reduces regulations applicable to crowdfunding securities and portals. Crowdfunding is used to raise capital through a large number of individuals investing potentially small amounts of money.\n\nThe bill exempts certain securities issued under crowdfunding regulations from state regulation of secondary transactions. It also exempts crowdfunding portals from (1) certain anti-money laundering reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and (2) liability for material misstatements or omissions unless the portal knowingly makes certain untrue statements or engages in fraud or deceit.\n\nThe bill revises the disclosure requirements for crowdfunding issuers with specified target offering amounts. The bill also expands the types of investors allowed to invest in these companies to include investment companies. Finally, the bill increases the aggregate amount these companies are allowed to raise in a 12-month period and generally raises the amount individuals are allowed to invest in a 12-month period."
