This bill requires the Department of Commerce to conduct an interagency review of the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting foreign direct investment from responsible private-sector entities based in trusted countries and addressing foreign trade barriers that firms in advanced technology sectors face in the global digital economy.

Among other elements, the review shall include an assessment of (1) the economic impact of foreign direct investment in the United States, (2) trends in global cross-border investment and data flows, (3) federal government policies that facilitate foreign direct investment, and (4) the adequacy of federal government efforts to encourage and facilitate foreign direct investment in the United States.

Commerce must report the findings of such review to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and include recommendations for increasing the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting foreign direct investment. The GAO must submit a review and assessment of the report to Congress.</summary>
