The office must also collect and address complaints from financial institutions, facilitate coordination between the fund and federal banking agencies, and ensure institutions have access to technical assistance.\n\nThe bill also requires the establishment of a process for revoking a CDFI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certification."
