    "text": "Strengthening Rural Cooperatives and Communities Act\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2028 and modifies the Rural Cooperative Development Grant (RCDG) Program. This Department of Agriculture (USDA) program provides grants to nonprofit institutions to help individuals and businesses start, expand, or improve rural cooperatives and other mutually-owned businesses through Rural Cooperative Development Centers.\n\nUSDA must give preference to grants that commit to providing technical assistance and other services to socially vulnerable,\u00a0underserved, or distressed communities. Under current law,\u00a0USDA must give preference to underserved and economically distressed areas in rural areas.\n\nIn addition, USDA may give an additional\u00a0preference to applications that commit to providing a 25% matching contribution for the center with private funds and in-kind contributions.\u00a0Specifically, USDA\u00a0may\u00a0award the maximum points in application scoring criteria to applicants that satisfy this requirement.\n\nUnder the bill, cooperative development includes activities (e.g., outreach, education, training, and technical assistance) to support the startup, expansion, or ongoing sustainability of new and existing cooperatives. Current law does not define cooperative development.\n\nThe bill directs the RCDG interagency working group to submit an annual report to Congress on its activities.\n\nFinally, the program currently includes cooperative research program requirements to collect data on the effects of all types of cooperatives on the national economy. Under the bill, USDA must analyze the data resulting from the research and include the data and analysis in the annual report to Congress."
