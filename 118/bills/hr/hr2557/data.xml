This bill requires the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to develop and implement a workload staffing model for each of the U.S. Border Patrol and Air and Marine Operations.

Such model shall include (1) consideration for essential frontline operator activities and functions, (2) variations in operating environments, and (3) present and planned infrastructure and technology. The CBP must also develop standard operating procedures for a workforce tracking system, train the workforce on the use of such system, and implement internal controls to ensure timely and accurate scheduling and reporting.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must review the model and provide feedback regarding the degree to which it is responsive to certain DHS recommendations.</summary>
