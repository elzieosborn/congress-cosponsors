  <summary date="2023-11-13T21:03:30Z" status="Introduced in House">Illicit Captagon Trafficking Suppression Act of 2023

This bill requires the President to impose sanctions on foreign persons determined to engage in activities or transactions to contribute to the illicit production and proliferation of captagon. Captagon is a marketing name for amphetamine-type stimulants. The bill requires sanctions on any foreign person the President determines (1) engages in activities or transactions contributing to the illicit production and international trafficking of captagon, or (2) knowingly receives property from those activities. The sanctions include blocking of property; ineligibility for U.S. visas, admission, or parole; and revocation of current visas.

The bill also requires the President to report to Congress on whether certain Syrian and Hezbollah leaders meet the criteria established in this bill for sanctions imposition.</summary>
