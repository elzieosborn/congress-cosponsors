Captagon is a marketing name for amphetamine-type stimulants. The bill requires sanctions on any foreign person the President determines (1) engages in activities or transactions contributing to the illicit production and international trafficking of captagon, or (2) knowingly receives property from those activities. The sanctions include blocking of property; ineligibility for U.S. visas, admission, or parole; and revocation of current visas.\n\nThe bill also requires the President to report to Congress on whether certain Syrian and Hezbollah leaders meet the criteria established in this bill for sanctions imposition."
