During the transition period, DOJ may restructure the department's antitrust division and deputize FTC antitrust employees to investigate and prosecute antitrust violations on behalf of DOJ prior to the completion of the transfer of personnel from the FTC to DOJ.DOJ is also authorized to require businesses to file annual or special reports about the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organization, conduct, practices, management, and relationship to other businesses filing such reports."
