    "text": "Mink: Vectors for Infection Risk in the United States Act or the Mink VIRUS Act\n\nThis bill prohibits the farming of mink for their fur beginning one year after the bill's enactment and establishes a compensation program.\n\nBeginning 90 days after the bill's enactment, any termination of farmed mink must be done in a manner that (1) meets the definition of euthanasia specified in Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations\u00a0(i.e., the humane destruction of an animal accomplished by a method that produces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or distress, or that utilizes anesthesia that causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death); and (2) is classified as acceptable by the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals.\n\nThis prohibition and these requirements do not preempt or limit any state law or regulation that is more restrictive. Further, any person in violation of this prohibition or these requirements is subject to civil penalties.\n\nThe bill also directs USDA to establish a payment program to compensate fur farm owners whose operations involve the farming of mink. Under the program, USDA must provide payments\u00a0for (1) the reasonable costs incurred to comply with this bill, and (2) the market value of the portion of the\u00a0farm involving mink farming (exclusive of the land). Fur farm owners may not use payment funds for any materials, supplies, labor costs, or activities associated with fur farm operations. Further, the owner must provide USDA with a permanent property easement that prohibits the operation of any fur farm on the easement area.\u00a0"
