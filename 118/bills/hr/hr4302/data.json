The disclosures are those described in the Sustainability Accounting Standard for the Renewable Resources\u00a0and Alternative Energy Sector or the Extractives and Mineral Processing Sector.\n\nEvery two years, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture must report to Congress on such operations, including greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, water management, biodiversity impacts, production, and the number of sites. For renewable energy operations on public lands or Indian lands, the report must include greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the production of the same amount of energy using fossil fuels."
