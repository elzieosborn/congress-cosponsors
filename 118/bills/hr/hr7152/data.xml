This bill sets policy regarding families divided between North Korea and the United States. Specifically, the Department of State shall identify Korean American families who wish to be reunited with family members who live in North Korea and establish a national registry of information on those families to (1) facilitate future reunions, and (2) provide a repository of information about such families.

Additionally, the State Department shall ensure that any direct dialogue with North Korea includes progress towards holding future reunions for Korean American families and their family members who live in North Korea.

The State Department shall report to Congress periodically on the registry and on North Korean actions regarding potential reunions of divided families.</summary>
