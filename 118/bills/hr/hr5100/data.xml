  <summary date="2024-09-23T14:26:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Military Family&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Ability to Move In Line with Your Dependents Act or the Military FAMILY Dependents Act

This bill requires a commanding officer to determine, within five calendar days, whether to grant a request for the reassignment of certain members of the Armed Forces on the basis of the residence of a dependent child.

Specifically, commanding officers must make such determinations for members of the Armed Forces who are on active duty and are assigned to a duty station located more than 300 miles from the residence of their dependent child who is registered under the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.

If a commanding officer denies a reassignment request, the member may request review of such denial, and the first general officer or flag officer in the chain of command of the member must complete the review not later than two weeks after the request is made.

The bill prohibits members from being subject to any adverse action for requesting a reassignment based on the residence of a dependent child.&#160;&#160;</summary>
