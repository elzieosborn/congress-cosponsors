This bill restricts the ability of large banks and financial companies to acquire banks in default or in danger of default if smaller institutions otherwise qualify. Specifically, if a merger with a bank in default results in one institution controlling more than a specified percentage of deposits or liabilities in the United States, regulators are prohibited from approving it, unless no other institution qualifies.</summary>
