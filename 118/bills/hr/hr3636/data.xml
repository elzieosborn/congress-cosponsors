This bill requires a contributor to political organizations who uses a credit card to make online contributions to such organizations to disclose the billing address, and the credit verification value, of such credit card at the time a contribution is made. A credit verification value is a series of numbers on a credit card (usually on the back of the card) that provides additional security for a transaction by credit card.</summary>
