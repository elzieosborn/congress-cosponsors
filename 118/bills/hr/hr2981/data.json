    "text": "Alleviating Intergenerational Debt Act or the AID Act\n\nThis bill creates a new student loan allowance calculation for determining the Student Aid Index (SAI). The SAI is an eligibility index number that is used to determine the amount of federal student aid a student is eligible to receive.\n\nIn particular, the bill revises the SAI formula to create a new allowance against income for dependent students' parents who have their own outstanding federal student loan debt, subject to income limitations.\n\nThe Department of Education (ED) must annually publish a revised table of student loan allowances.\n\nThe bill requires ED to submit an annual report to Congress on the impacts of the bill, including (1) the number and percentage of students whose SAI include the subtraction of this allowance, separated out by eligibility for Federal Pell Grants; and (2) the average amount of the allowance."
