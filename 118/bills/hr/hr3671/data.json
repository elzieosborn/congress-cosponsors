HHS must work with the Fire Administration (a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and other federal agencies to incorporate the best practices into education and training programs for public safety officers.\n\nIn addition, the Fire Administration must develop resources to educate mental health professionals about the workplace stressors and evidence-based therapies to treat mental health issues common to firefighters and emergency medical services (EMS) providers.\n\nThe bill also permits HHS to establish (1) a system at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for reporting suicides of public safety officers, and (2) grant programs to support behavioral health and wellness programs for fire departments,\u00a0EMS agencies, and health care providers."
