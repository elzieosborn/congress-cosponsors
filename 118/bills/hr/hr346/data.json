A NOTAM is a notice containing information essential to personnel concerned with flight operations but not known far enough in advance to be publicized by other means. It states the abnormal status of a component of the National Airspace System.\n\nSpecifically, the task force must (1) review existing methods for publishing NOTAMs and flight operations information for pilots; (2) review regulations, policies, systems, and international standards relating to NOTAMs, including their content and presentation to pilots; (3) evaluate and determine best practices to organize, prioritize, and present flight operations information in a manner that optimizes pilot review and retention of relevant information; (4) provide recommendations to improve the publication and delivery of NOTAM information; and (5) report to Congress on its reviews and evaluations.\n\nBy September 30, 2024, the FAA must (1) complete implementation of a federal NOTAM system and implement a back-up system, and (2) brief Congress on a plan to enhance information delivery through this federal system to promote further global harmonization and provide users of the National Airspace System a consistent format for domestic and international operations."
