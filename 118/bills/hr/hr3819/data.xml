This bill eliminates the applicability of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) to the District of Columbia government. RFRA provides that a government action that imposes a substantial&#160;burden on a person's exercise of religion is lawful only if the burden (1) is in furtherance of a compelling government interest, and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering such interest.&#160;</summary>
