This bill directs the President to impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign persons who are current or former officials of the Mexican government and who are responsible for acts of significant corruption. These sanctions shall also apply to foreign persons acting on behalf of such a government official.

The sanctions shall not apply to acts related to U.S. intelligence activities. The President may waive application of&#160;the sanctions for U.S. national security interests or to prevent undue economic harm to the people of Mexico.</summary>
