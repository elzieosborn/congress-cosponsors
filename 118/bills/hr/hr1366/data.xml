This bill requires the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs to conduct a risk assessment of properties that receive low-income housing assistance to identify properties with the greatest risk of exposing children under six years old to lead hazards (e.g., lead-based paint and lead service lines). The office must develop an action plan for remediation and control of lead hazards in identified properties and submit a report on low-income housing properties with lead hazards, including the number of children under six living at those properties.</summary>
