This bill requires the Department of Justice to detain any alien found to be unlawfully present in the United States and arrested for various crimes that would render the alien deportable or inadmissible.

 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may release the alien to an appropriate authority for proceedings related to the arrest, but DHS must resume custody for any period that the alien is not in such authority's custody.

If the alien is not convicted of crimes for which the alien was arrested, DHS must continue to detain the alien until removal proceedings are completed. DHS must complete such removal proceedings within 90 days.</summary>
