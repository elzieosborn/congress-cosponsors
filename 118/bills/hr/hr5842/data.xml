  <summary date="2025-10-02T14:15:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Coast Guard Sustained Funding Act of 2023

This bill provides continuing appropriations to the Coast Guard for pay and benefits when there is a Coast Guard-specific funding lapse.

Under the bill, a&#160;Coast Guard-specific funding lapse occurs when a bill providing appropriations for the Coast Guard for a fiscal year has not been enacted before the beginning of that fiscal year, and no joint resolution providing continuing appropriations for the Coast Guard is in effect.

If a Coast Guard-specific funding lapse occurs, the bill provides appropriations to the Coast Guard for (1) pay and allowances for military members of the Coast Guard, including reserve components, who perform active service or inactive-duty training; and (2) pay and benefits for certain civilian and contract employees who are providing support to members of the Coast Guard or another Armed Force and are working during the funding lapse.&#160;</summary>
