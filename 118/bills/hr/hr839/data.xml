  <summary date="2024-11-29T20:38:28Z" status="Passed House">China Exchange Rate Transparency Act of 2023

This bill requires the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to use the voice and vote of the United States to advocate for increased exchange rate transparency from China.

Some areas of focus for this advocacy are (1) Chinese exchange rate arrangements, including any indirect foreign exchange market intervention through Chinese financial institutions or state-owned enterprises; (2) enhanced multilateral and bilateral surveillance by the IMF; and (3) stronger consideration of China's performance as a responsible stakeholder in the international monetary system when evaluating quota and voting shares at the IMF.

The requirements of the bill expire seven years and 30 days after the date of the bill's enactment or earlier if China meets certain conditions regarding its exchange rate policies.</summary>
