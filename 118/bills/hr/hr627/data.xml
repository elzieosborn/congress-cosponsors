This bill requires documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and imposes criminal penalties for violations.

Specifically, the bill prohibits an individual from registering to vote in federal elections unless, at the time the individual applies to register to vote, the individual provides documentary proof of U.S. citizenship.

The chief state election official of a state must consult with the Election Assistance Commission to determine the documents an individual must provide to prove U.S. citizenship.

An individual who violates this bill shall be fined, imprisoned for up to five years, or both.</summary>
