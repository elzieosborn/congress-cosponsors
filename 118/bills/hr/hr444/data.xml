  <summary date="2023-02-09T12:04:51Z" status="Introduced in House">End For-Profit Prisons Act of 2023

This bill establishes a framework to phase out existing Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and U.S. Marshals Service contracts with private companies for correctional facilities and community confinement facilities (e.g., halfway houses).

The bill requires the Department of Justice to develop guidelines for community reintegration programs at community confinement facilities.

In carrying out prerelease and reentry planning procedures, the bill requires the BOP to ensure prisoners receive information and counseling about criminal record expungement; educational, employment, and treatment programs; and applications for public assistance programs, a driver's license, and voter registration. The BOP must also provide prisoners with postrelease information about fines, assessments, surcharges, restitution, and other penalties.</summary>
