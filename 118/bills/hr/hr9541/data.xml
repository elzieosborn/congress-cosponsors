This bill authorizes electrical utilities receiving certain financial assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for the restoration of power&#160;to also carry out cost-effective hazard mitigation activities. &#160;

Additionally, the bill specifies that electrical utilities receiving such assistance may, if otherwise eligible, also receive hazard mitigation assistance under a separate provision of the&#160;Stafford Act related to repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities.&#160;</summary>
