  <summary date="2023-04-03T23:03:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Easy Enrollment in Health Care Act

This bill revises the procedures related to enrollment in health insurance affordability programs, including Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and state-operated Basic Health Programs. The bill provides funding to support the changes.

Specifically, the bill permits individuals who do not have minimum essential coverage to, in conjunction with filing their tax return, determine whether any members of their household are eligible for an insurance affordability program and enroll in minimum essential coverage.

The bill makes individuals eligible for Medicaid or CHIP based on a prior finding of eligibility for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Additionally, the bill provides access to certain information to support enrollment in insurance affordability programs.</summary>
