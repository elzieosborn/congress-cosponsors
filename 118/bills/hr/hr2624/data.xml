This bill allows certain issuers of securities regulated as emerging growth companies to continue operating under such regulations, including those related to reduced disclosures and other exemptions, for an additional five years. It also raises the limit of total annual gross revenues under which issuers qualify as emerging growth companies to $2 billion. Finally, under the bill, a company may continue to be considered an emerging growth company even after it becomes a large accelerated filer.</summary>
