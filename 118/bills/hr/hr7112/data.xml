This bill directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to track and report on the&#160;top illegal robocall campaigns. The FCC is required to establish a framework for designating the top 100 campaigns, which must focus on campaigns involving primarily robocalls that are illegal or suspected to be illegal. The bill directs the FCC to release monthly reports on the designated top campaigns.&#160;

The bill defines robocalls as calls and text messages sent using (1) artificial dialing technology, or (2) an artificially generated message or an artificial or prerecorded voice. &#160;</summary>
