  <summary date="2024-11-26T19:41:49Z" status="Passed House">Improving Travel for Families Act

This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to allow a child who is 10 years old or younger&#160;to accompany their parent (or legal guardian) in the Global Entry lane when arriving at a U.S. international airport if the parent or guardian is a Global Entry member but the child is not.

(Global Entry is a trusted traveler program that allows for the expedited processing of preapproved, low-risk travelers at certain ports of entry.)

If a parent is applying for Global Entry on behalf of such children (i.e., children authorized by this bill to travel under the parent's Global Entry membership), DHS must allow that parent to schedule a single interview relating to the parent's relationship with up to four such children.</summary>
