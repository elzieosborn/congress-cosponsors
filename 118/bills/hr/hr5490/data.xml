  <summary date="2025-08-19T20:06:44Z" status="Public Law">Bolstering Ecosystems Against Coastal Harm Act or the BEACH Act

This act modifies the coastal areas belonging to the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS)&#160;and which are, therefore, ineligible to receive federal financial assistance for land development. It also expands exceptions to this restriction, establishes additional requirements for agencies administering&#160;the CBRS, and requires a study relating to coastal barrier ecosystems.

Specifically, the act updates and replaces existing CBRS maps with maps&#160;recommended&#160;by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in a 2022 report to Congress titled John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System Hurricane Sandy Remapping Project.&#160;Affected coastal areas are located in 13 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.

In addition,&#160;the act creates&#160;new exceptions to the limitation on federal financial assistance&#160;for certain (1) aquaculture operations (e.g., shellfish production)&#160;and (2) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers coastal storm risk management projects.&#160;The act also provides that&#160;insurable structures (i.e., walled and roofed buildings) that are on the ground in areas added to the CBRS within one year of enactment remain eligible for federal financial assistance.&#160;

The act directs FWS&#160;to issue regulations&#160;requiring owners or lessors of real property in communities affected by the CBRS to disclose this information to prospective buyers or lessees.

Additionally, the&#160;act provides that FWS shall develop and finalize guidance relating to the expenditure of federal&#160;funds in emergency situations that threaten life, land, and property immediately adjacent to a system unit. The act&#160;also generally requires agencies that are involved with the CBRS&#160;to revise or issue regulations or guidance as necessary within one year of enactment.

Finally, the act directs FWS and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct a scientific evaluation of the dynamics of coastal barrier ecosystems. FWS and USGS must provide related recommendations for the CBRS to Congress.</summary>
