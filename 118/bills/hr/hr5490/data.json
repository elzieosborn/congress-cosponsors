    "text": "Bolstering Ecosystems Against Coastal Harm Act or the BEACH Act\n\nThis act modifies the coastal areas belonging to the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS)\u00a0and which are, therefore, ineligible to receive federal financial assistance for land development. It also expands exceptions to this restriction, establishes additional requirements for agencies administering\u00a0the CBRS, and requires a study relating to coastal barrier ecosystems.\n\nSpecifically, the act updates and replaces existing CBRS maps with maps\u00a0recommended\u00a0by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in a 2022 report to Congress titled John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System Hurricane Sandy Remapping Project.\u00a0Affected coastal areas are located in 13 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\nIn addition,\u00a0the act creates\u00a0new exceptions to the limitation on federal financial assistance\u00a0for certain (1) aquaculture operations (e.g., shellfish production)\u00a0and (2) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers coastal storm risk management projects.\u00a0The act also provides that\u00a0insurable structures (i.e., walled and roofed buildings) that are on the ground in areas added to the CBRS within one year of enactment remain eligible for federal financial assistance.\u00a0\n\nThe act directs FWS\u00a0to issue regulations\u00a0requiring owners or lessors of real property in communities affected by the CBRS to disclose this information to prospective buyers or lessees.\n\nAdditionally, the\u00a0act provides that FWS shall develop and finalize guidance relating to the expenditure of federal\u00a0funds in emergency situations that threaten life, land, and property immediately adjacent to a system unit. The act\u00a0also generally requires agencies that are involved with the CBRS\u00a0to revise or issue regulations or guidance as necessary within one year of enactment.\n\nFinally, the act directs FWS and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct a scientific evaluation of the dynamics of coastal barrier ecosystems. FWS and USGS must provide related recommendations for the CBRS to Congress."
