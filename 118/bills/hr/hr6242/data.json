Absent uniformed services voters under UOCAVA are primarily active duty service members who are away from their voting residence. These include members of the U.S. Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, and Navy. The current definition of absent uniformed services voter also includes (1) members of the merchant marine and commissioned officers of the U.S. Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and (2) spouses or dependents who also are absent from their voting residence due to the member's active duty or service.\n\nThis bill expands the definition of absent uniformed services voter\u00a0to include (1) members on active service or inactive duty training who are absent from their voting residence, and (2) spouses or dependents who are absent from their voting residence due to the member's active service or inactive duty training.\n\nThe bill also expands the definition of overseas voter to include an absent uniformed services voter who, by reason of active service or inactive duty training, is absent from the United States on the date of the election involved."
