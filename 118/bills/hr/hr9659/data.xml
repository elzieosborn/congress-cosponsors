This bill broadens the exclusion of amounts received by members of the Armed Forces as a basic allowance for housing from income for purposes of meeting the income requirements of the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). This bill also increases the basis of properties developed within 15 miles of large military installations, generally making the developer of the property eligible for a larger LIHTC.

Under current law, to be eligible for the LIHTC, properties must rent a percentage of units to individuals with incomes equal to or less than a percentage of an area&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s median gross income (often referred to as the set-aside test). For purposes of calculating an individual&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s income to determine if it is equal or less than an area&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s median gross income, the basic allowance for housing received by members of the Armed Forces is excluded only if the property is in a specific location that meets requirements related to population growth for a defined time period.&#160;

This bill excludes amounts received by members of the Armed Forces as a basic housing allowance in determining their income and eligibility for low-income housing, without restrictions on the location of the property or population growth of the location.&#160;

Finally, this bill treats properties developed within 15 miles of a large military installation as located in a difficult development area, which qualifies the property for an increased basis of 130% (instead of 100%) and generally increases the amount of the LIHTC.</summary>
