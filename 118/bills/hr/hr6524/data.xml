This bill establishes an apprenticeship program and a pilot program on cybersecurity.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency may establish one or more apprenticeship programs that lead directly to employment in

 a cybersecurity work role with the agency; or a position with a company or other entity, as prescribed by this bill. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) shall establish a pilot program under which the VA shall provide cyber-specific training for members of the Armed Forces transitioning from service in the Armed Forces to civilian life and veterans.

The bill extends through FY2025 the requirement for each federal agency to submit an annual report to the Office of Personnel Management that identifies information technology, cybersecurity, or other cyber-related work roles of critical need in the workforce of the agency.</summary>
