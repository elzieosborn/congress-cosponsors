    "text": "High-skilled Immigration Reform for Employment Act\n\nThis bill increases the annual cap on H-1B visas (nonimmigrant visas for workers in specialty occupations) and authorizes grants for education.\n\nSpecifically, the bill (1) increases the cap on such visas for each fiscal year from 65,000 to 130,000; and (2) exempts from this cap all visas for individuals with a postgraduate degree from a U.S. institution of higher education (currently, only up to 20,000 such visas are exempted each fiscal year).\n\nThe bill also modifies the criteria for determining whether an employer is an H-1B-dependent employer. (Such employers are subject to additional requirements.)\n\nThe Department of Education may make grants to states to support science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly referred to as STEM) education."
