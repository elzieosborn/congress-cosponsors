  <summary date="2024-02-16T18:29:59Z" status="Introduced in House">Hydrogen Aviation Strategy Act

This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) to exercise leadership in the creation of federal and international policies relating to the safe and efficient use of hydrogen to increase aviation decarbonization and reduce air and noise pollution.

For example, the FAA and DOE must

 establish positions and goals for the use of hydrogen to increase aviation decarbonization; study (through grants, contracts, or interagency agreements) how the use of hydrogen would contribute to aviation decarbonization and air and noise pollution; study ways of accelerating the introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft; and establish an advisory committee composed of representatives of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the aerospace industry, aviation suppliers, hydrogen producers, airlines, airport sponsors, fixed base operators, and other stakeholders to advise the Department of Transportation, the FAA, and DOE on related activities. The FAA must also exercise leadership in the creation of federal regulations, standards, and guidance relating to the safe and efficient use of hydrogen to increase aviation decarbonization and reduce air and noise pollution.</summary>
