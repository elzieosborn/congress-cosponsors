    "text": "American Confidence in Elections: District of Columbia Voter Identification Act\n\nThis bill establishes citizenship and identification requirements to vote in the District of Columbia (DC).\n\nThe bill requires an individual to provide documentary proof that they are a U.S. citizen to register to vote in DC.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires an individual to present\u00a0current and valid identification to vote or to receive a ballot\u00a0(i.e., when not voting in person). Acceptable identification includes a DC driver's license, U.S. passport, military identification, or student identification. The bill also requires an election official to obtain proof of residency for any voter whose identification does not include the voter's current address.\n\nFurther, DC must provide certain identification (e.g., a driver's license)\u00a0at no cost to an individual\u00a0who\u00a0is unable to afford the fee.\u00a0\n\nFinally, the bill requires election officials to compile photographs of all eligible DC voters in the poll book used to administer elections. The bill authorizes and directs the DC government to obtain such photo records from DC government records, by photographing voters, or by making a copy of a voter's photo identification. The bill prohibits the photo records included in the poll book from being used for purposes other than for the administration of DC elections."
