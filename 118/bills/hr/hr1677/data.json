The bill also outlines minimum requirements for the capability that address protection of classified information and other matters.\n\nIncumbent informing capability is a mechanism that facilitates the sharing of spectrum allocated for both federal and nonfederal uses; it enables federal users to reliably inform nonfederal users when and where the federal systems are operating in order to manage harmful interference between the federal and nonfederal uses."
