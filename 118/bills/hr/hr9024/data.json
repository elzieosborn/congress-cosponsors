FEMA must also\u00a0convene an advisory panel to review its process for determining when an emergency- or disaster-causing incident begins and ends. Additionally,\u00a0FEMA must conduct a study on the impacts of extreme heat, recommend guidance on mitigating and responding to extreme heat, and submit a report to Congress on these actions.\n\nThe bill also\u00a0authorizes FEMA to consider extreme heat preparedness and mitigation projects eligible under its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program."
