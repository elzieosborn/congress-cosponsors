(Multi-cloud software technology allows for data, application, and program portability and interoperability between multiple cloud computing software vendors and between public, private, and edge cloud environments.) The bill also sets forth requirements for OMB to brief Congress and for the Government Accountability Office to provide\u00a0two reports to Congress on specified topics."
