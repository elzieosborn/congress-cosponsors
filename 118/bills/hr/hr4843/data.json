(The program provides an eligible F-1 student visa holder temporary employment authorization before or after completion of the student's studies, or both.)\n\nUnder this bill, a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) may only participate in the program for four months with no extensions available. (Current rules generally allow an eligible individual to participate for up to one year with full-time employment; current rules also allow individuals with certain degrees to obtain a 24-month extension.)\n\nThe bill also bars certain individuals from participating in the program, specifically an individual (1) with a degree or working in a sensitive field, or (2) who is employed by or otherwise affiliated with an entity owned or controlled by the Communist Party of China."
