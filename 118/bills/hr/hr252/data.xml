This bill establishes a point of order that, when the annualized rate of inflation exceeds 4.5%, prohibits the House and Senate from considering legislation that provides new budget authority and is estimated to increase the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The prohibition may be waived in the Senate by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Senate.</summary>
