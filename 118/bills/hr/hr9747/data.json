It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2025 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2025 begins on October 1, 2024.\u00a0\n\nThe CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2024 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 101) This section provides FY2025 appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects or activities at the levels and under the conditions included in specified FY2024 appropriations acts. The section also extends several immigration-related programs and specifies several exceptions.\n\n(Sec. 102) This section prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) from funding new or accelerated production of certain projects and other activities and certain multiyear procurements prior to the enactment of the regular annual appropriations act.\n\n(Sec. 103) This section specifies that funds provided by Section 101 of this division shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided in the pertinent appropriations act.\n\n(Sec. 104) This section generally prohibits appropriations provided by Section 101 of this division from being used to initiate or resume any project or activity that was not funded during FY2024.\n\n(Sec. 105) This section specifies that appropriations provided by the CR are to be used to conduct FY2025 activities and programs during the period of the CR.\n\n(Sec. 106) This section continues the appropriations provided by this division through the earlier of December 20, 2024, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act.\n\n(Sec. 107) This section requires expenditures for activities funded in this division to be charged to the full-year appropriations bill and relevant account when the applicable appropriations bill becomes law.\n\n(Sec. 108) This section waives the normal time limitations for submission and approval of apportionments of accounts funded in annual appropriations acts.\n\n(Sec. 109) This section limits disbursements for programs that would otherwise have high initial rates of operation or would complete distribution of funding at the beginning of the fiscal year if those actions would impinge on final congressional funding prerogatives.\n\n(Sec. 110) This section requires this division to be implemented so that only the most limited funding action permitted by this division is taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities.\n\n(Sec. 111) This section continues funding for certain appropriated entitlements and other mandatory payments with budget authority provided in an FY2024 appropriations act at the rate necessary to maintain program levels under current law. It also provides authority to obligate funds for mandatory payments that are due up to 30 days following the expiration of the CR.\n\n(Sec. 112) This section permits funding made available by this division for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each department and agency to be apportioned at the rate necessary to avoid furloughs. It also requires all necessary actions to reduce or defer non-personnel-related administrative expenses to be taken prior to using this authority.\n\n(Sec. 113) This section permits funds appropriated by this division to be obligated and expended notwithstanding specified statutory provisions restricting appropriations for foreign assistance, the Department of State, international broadcasting, and intelligence activities in the absence of prior authorizations.\n\n(Sec. 114) This section extends designations of emergency spending and disaster relief funds to funds provided by this division that previously carried those designations.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 115) This section sets forth requirements for the treatment of rescissions when federal agencies implement the funding levels provided by the CR.\n\n(Sec. 116) This section allows the Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Farm Service Agency to apportion funding for the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Program account at the rate necessary to accommodate approved applications for direct and guaranteed farm ownership loans and direct farm operating loans.\n\n(Sec. 117) This section allows USDA to apportion funding at the rate necessary to maintain authorized activities of\u00a0the Rural Housing Service's Rural Community Facilities Program.\n\n(Sec. 118) This section allows USDA to apportion funding at the rate necessary to maintain participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).\n\n(Sec. 119) This section allows USDA to apportion funding at the rate necessary to maintain the current program caseload for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.\n\n(Sec. 120) This section extends various authorities under the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 through the duration of the CR.

The extensions apply through the duration of the CR.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 124) This section makes specified funds available to the Department of the Treasury Office of Inspector General to continue oversight activities related to the Coronavirus Relief Fund and the Emergency Rental Assistance program.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 125) This section provides additional funding to the Office of Administration within the Executive Office of the President for activities related to the presidential transition.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 126) This section provides additional funding to the District of Columbia for costs associated with emergency planning and security activities related to the January 2025 Presidential Inauguration.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 127) This section removes the requirement for a specified portion of the FY2024 funds provided for the Federal Payment to the District of Columbia Public Defender Service to be used for costs associated with relocation under a replacement lease for headquarters offices, field offices, and related facilities.\n\n(Sec. 128) This section authorizes the District of Columbia to spend local funds at the rates set forth in the Fiscal Year 2025 Local Budget Act of 2024 for programs and activities that were funded in FY2024.\n\n(Sec. 129) This section provides additional funding to the General Services Administration for expenses related to the presidential transition.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 130) This section provides additional funding to the National Archives and Records Administration to carry out presidential transition activities under the Presidential Records Act of 1978.\n\n(Sec. 131) This section provides a higher rate of operations to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for transfers from certain trust funds for the administrative expenses of federal retirement and insurance programs (e.g., the Postal Service Health Benefits Program). It also decreases the rate of operations under the CR for certain other OPM functions, including employment of experts and consultants, certain veterans' medical examinations, rental of conference rooms and passenger motor vehicles, authorized reception and representation expenses, and certain federal employee travel and subsistence expenses authorized under the Voting Rights Act.\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 132) This section permits the Coast Guard to use funds provided by the CR for closeout costs relating to the C\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27J missionization program.\n\n(Sec. 133) This section makes a technical correction to a provision in the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 that authorized the Coast Guard to acquire a commercially available polar icebreaker.\n\n(Sec. 134) This section allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to apportion funding for the Disaster Relief Fund at the rate necessary to carry out response and recovery activities under the Robert T.
