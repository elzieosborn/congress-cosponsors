    "text": "Stop Scam PACs Act\n\nThis bill expands prohibitions with respect to fraudulent misrepresentation of campaign authority.\n\nCurrent law sets forth two prohibitions with respect to fraudulent misrepresentation of campaign authority. The first prohibits a candidate for federal office or the candidate's employees or agents from fraudulently misrepresenting themselves as speaking\u00a0or otherwise acting for or on behalf of another candidate or political party on a matter that is damaging to such other candidate or political party. The bill instead applies this prohibition to any person, to any misrepresentation, and for any purpose.\n\nThe second prohibits any person from fraudulently misrepresenting themselves as speaking or otherwise acting for or on behalf of any candidate or political party to solicit contributions or donations. The bill instead applies this prohibition to any misrepresentation and for purposes of soliciting money or any other thing of value.\n\nThe two prohibitions under current law refer to misrepresentations on behalf of candidates or political parties. This bill also extends applicability to political committees and organizations."
