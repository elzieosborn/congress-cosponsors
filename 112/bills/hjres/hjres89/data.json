Authorizes waivers for any fiscal year under other specified circumstances involving military conflict or if a presidential declaration of major disaster is in effect.\n\nExcludes: (1) from estimated receipts, specified funds derived from net borrowing; (2) from estimated outlays, funds for repayment of debt principal and for capital investments; and (3) from receipts or outlays, receipts (including attributable interest) and outlays of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund."
