  <summary date="2012-09-13T19:02:15Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Guardian Accountability and Senior Protection Act - Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize the Assistant Secretary of Aging in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to and enter into contracts with states and other specified public and private recipients for: (1) assessing the fairness, effectiveness, timeliness, safety, integrity, and accessibility of adult guardianship and conservatorship proceedings; and (2) implementing necessary changes as a result of the assessments.

Requires the Assistant Secretary to submit to the State Justice Institute recommendations for the awarding of such grants and contracts.

Authorizes the award of grants to enable the highest court of each state to: (1) conduct assessments used with respect to a full, limited, or temporary adult guardianship or conservatorship; (2) implement necessary changes in light of them; and (3) collect necessary data regarding those proceedings and the impact of the necessary changes.

Requires the Assistant Secretary to set aside 25% of amounts made available for grants in each fiscal year to enable courts to implement or improve systems to conduct background checks on prospective guardians and conservators.</summary>
