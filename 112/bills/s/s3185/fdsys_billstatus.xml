Permits the petitioner to apply for a certification directly with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p> <p>Includes among employment-based immigrant preferences aliens who graduate from a U.S. research institution with a doctorate or master's degree in a STEM field and intend to work in a related field. </p> <p>Excludes an alien student who intends to pursue an advanced STEM field degree in a U.S. research institution from the foreign student visa requirement that an alien student has a foreign residence which he or she has no intention of abandoning.</p>]]></text>
