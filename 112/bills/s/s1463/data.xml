  <summary date="2011-10-17T19:31:12Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Breastfeeding Promotion Act of 2011 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include lactation (i.e., breastfeeding or the expressing of milk from the breast) as protected conduct under such Act (specifically, an amendment to such Act commonly known as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act).

Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to extend the requirement that certain employers provide reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child to bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity employees or outside salesmen who are exempt from federal labor laws that limit the number of hours in a workweek.</summary>
