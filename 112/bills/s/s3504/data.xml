  <summary date="2012-08-29T16:53:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Native American Indian Education Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Education to pay four-year Native American-serving nontribal institutions of higher education the out-of-state tuition of their Indian students if those schools are required to provide a tuition-free education, with the support of their state, to Indian students in fulfillment of a condition under which the college or state received its original grant of land and facilities from the federal government.

Limits that payment each fiscal year to the institution's total out-of-state tuition for Indian students in academic year 2012-2013.

Treats such payments as reimbursements to such institutions from their states.

Rescinds unobligated discretionary appropriations to offset the costs of this program.</summary>
