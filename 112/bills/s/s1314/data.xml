  <summary date="2011-09-01T20:34:19Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish minimum funding levels for specified veterans' benefits contracts and grants to ensure that each state receives sufficient funding to support at least one disabled veterans' outreach program specialist and one local veterans' employment representative per 5,000 square miles of service delivery area within the state.

Allows the Secretary, in establishing such minimum levels, to establish hold-harmless criteria for states and exclude consideration of counties with a population density of less than one person per square mile.

Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the needs of veterans residing in an area consisting of a county or counties with fewer than seven persons per square mile.</summary>
