  <summary date="2012-10-16T15:03:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Delphi Pensions Restoration Act of 2012 - Amends the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to require transfer to the Delphi Retired Employees Fund of all proceeds from the sale or transfer, after enactment of this Act, of any stock, warrant, or financial instrument acquired by the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with providing financial assistance to the General Motors Corporation (GM).

Establishes the Delphi Retired Employees Fund in the Treasury for payments to eligible employees separated from Delphi Corporation who participated in a now terminated Delphi-sponsored defined benefit plan, but who are not covered by any agreement between GM and participants in another defined benefit plan under which GM pays covered participants nonforfeitable benefits equal to the amount they would have been entitled to receive under the plan but for the plan's termination.

Makes the Fund available to pay each eligible separated employee an amount equal to such nonforfeitable benefits, reduced by any amounts already paid the employee by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).</summary>
