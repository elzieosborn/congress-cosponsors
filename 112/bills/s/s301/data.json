Requires the Secretary of Transportation to afford such carriers an opportunity to revise their plans as lines are added or removed.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from disapproving a carrier's plan on the grounds that it does not cover a line over which intercity rail or commuter rail passenger transportation will not be provided, nor will poison- or toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials be transported, on or after December 31, 2015.\n\nRequires a certain report by the Secretary to Congress to include the ability of such carriers to meet the December 31, 2015, deadline for implementation of positive train control systems."
