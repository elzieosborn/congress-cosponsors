  <summary date="2012-10-16T20:16:03Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Authorized Rural Water Projects Completion Act - Establishes in the Treasury a Reclamation Rural Water Construction Fund, into which the Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit for each of FY2013-FY2029 a specified amount of revenues that would otherwise be deposited in the reclamation fund established by the Reclamation Act of 1902.

Authorizes the Secretary to use amounts from the Fund to complete construction of rural water projects: (1) that were authorized to be carried out on or before this Act's enactment, or (2) for which the Secretary completed a feasibility report by September 30, 2012, that recommends construction and for which an Act of Congress enacted after this Act's enactment has authorized construction. Prohibits the Secretary from using amounts from the Fund to pay for project operation and maintenance costs.

Prohibits the Secretary from expending amounts from the Fund until the date on which the Secretary develops: (1) programmatic goals that would enable the completion of construction of the authorized rural water projects as expeditiously as possible and that reflect the goals and priorities identified in the laws authorizing the projects and the goals of the Reclamation Rural Water Supply Act; and (2) funding prioritization criteria that takes into account specified information, including an evaluation of the need for potable water supplies in the affected rural and tribal communities, the completion status of a project, and the financial needs of the affected communities.

Terminates the Fund on September 30, 2034.</summary>
