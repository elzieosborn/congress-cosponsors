  <summary date="2013-01-04T18:47:05Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on November 29, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

No-Hassle Flying Act of 2012 - Authorizes the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration [TSA]) to determine whether checked baggage on a flight or flight segment originating at an airport outside the United States must be re-screened in the United States for explosives before it can continue on any additional flight or flight segment if the baggage has already been screened in the foreign airport in accordance with an aviation security preclearance agreement between the United States and the country in which the airport is located.

Defines "aviation security preclearance agreement" to mean an agreement that delineates and implements security standards and protocols comparable to those of the United States and therefore sufficiently effective to enable passengers to deplane into sterile areas of U.S. airports.

Directs the Assistant Secretary to report annually to Congress on the re-screening of baggage.</summary>
