  <summary date="2012-01-10T16:39:57Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fishery Science Improvement Act of 2011 - Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 to prohibit the requirement that a mechanism be established for specifying annual catch limits in fishery management plans prepared by any Regional Fishery Management Council, or by the Secretary of Commerce, implementing regulations, or annual specifications, at a level such that overfishing does not occur in the fishery, from applying to: (1) a stock of fish for which a stock assessment has not been performed during the previous six-year period, if the Secretary has determined that the fishery is not subject to overfishing of that stock and that the stock is not overfished; and (2) an ecosystem component stock.

Defines "ecosystem component stock" as a stock of fish determined by the Secretary to be a nontarget stock that is not subject to overfishing or overfished.

Requires that ecosystem component species as determined by the Secretary prior to enactment of this Act be determined to be such ecosystem component stocks after enactment of this Act.</summary>
