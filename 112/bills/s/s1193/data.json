Requires a state to give priority to eligible projects that help meet certain state of good repair performance standards and targets for the National Highway System (NHS).\n\nRequires a state to: (1) develop an asset management process to support the development of system preservation and renewal plans for each class of infrastructure on NHS and federal-aid highways, and (2) develop and update such plans biennially for approval by the Secretary.\n\nRequires each state to develop a safe streets policy that ensures that the safety and convenience of all users of a transportation system are accommodated in all phases of project planning and development."
