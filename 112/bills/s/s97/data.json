Requires the non-federal share of the total cost of any eligible activities to be carried out using amounts provided under this Act to be no less than 25%.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations to the Administrator to carry out this Act for each of FY2012-FY2016. Prohibits such amounts from being used by a management conference under the National Estuary Program."
