  <summary date="2012-03-23T17:04:17Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Prohibits a U.S. commercial entity from transferring any proprietary technology or intellectual property researched, developed, or commercialized with federal financial assistance to an entity: (1) owned or controlled by the government of a country which requires any U.S. commercial entity to transfer proprietary technology or intellectual property as a condition of doing business, or (2) in which the citizens of such a country hold 5% interests of the capital structure of that entity.

Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to waive such prohibition if the transfer would not compromise U.S. economic interests or competitiveness.</summary>
