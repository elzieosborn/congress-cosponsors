  <summary date="2011-09-06T16:46:03Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Declares that failure by a financial institution or any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents to report a suspicious transaction is not a violation of specified monetary transaction reporting requirements if the institution or person has: (1) in effect an established decision-making process with respect to suspicious transactions, (2) made a good faith effort to follow existing policies, procedures, and processes with respect to such transactions; and (3) determined not to file a report with respect to a particular transaction.

Deems failure to submit a suspicious transaction report to be a violation of such reporting requirements if it is accompanied by evidence of bad faith on the part of either the financial institution or other person.</summary>
