Prohibits such amount from exceeding $25 for the first 5-year period and $30 for any subsequent period.\n\nRequires the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or the Department of the Interior to collect the amount established for each Stamp sold for a hunting year if the Secretary determines, at any time before February 1 of a calendar year, that all amounts in the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund have been obligated for expenditure.\n\nSpecifies that the amounts described in this Act are the amounts in the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund which are available for obligation and attributable to amounts appropriated pursuant to the Act and the sale of stamps under this Act.\n\nPermits the Secretary, in consultation with the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, to waive requirements under the Act relating to the prohibition on the taking of migratory waterfowl with respect to certain individuals as determined to be appropriate. Instructs the Secretary, in making a determination to waive such requirements, to grant only those waivers that will have a minimal adverse effect on the funds to be deposited into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund."
