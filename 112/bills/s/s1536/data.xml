  <summary date="2011-09-21T21:23:54Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Notification of Origin of Telecommunications and Internet Consumer Exchanges Act of 2011 or the NOTICE Act of 2011 - Requires a business entity that initiates or receives a customer service communication to require each of its employees or agents participating in the communication to disclose their physical location at the beginning of each such communication unless all involved employees or agents are located in the United States. Exempts any communication: (1) initiated by a consumer if the consumer knows or reasonably should know that the employee or agent is located outside the United States; or (2) related to the provision of emergency services.

Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to exclude certain classes or types of business entities or customer services communications from the requirements of this Act for exceptionally compelling circumstances that justify such exclusions. Sets forth enforcement provisions.</summary>
