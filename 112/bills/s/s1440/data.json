Authorizes the Director of NIH to make awards for not more than eight pediatric research consortia, with a minimum of one pediatric research consortium that prioritizes collaboration with institutions serving rural areas. Authorizes the Director of NIH to make awards for more than eight pediatric research consortia based on a finding of need by the Director, after giving written notice to Congress. Requires such consortia to: (1) be formed from a collaboration of cooperating institutions, (2) be coordinated by a lead institution, (3) agree to disseminate scientific findings rapidly and efficiently, and (4) meet requirements prescribed by the Director of NIH. Allows such support to be for a period of up to five years with additional extensions by the Director of NIH.\n\nRequires the Director of NIH to provide for the coordination of activities among the consortia and to require the periodic preparation and submission of reports on their activities.
