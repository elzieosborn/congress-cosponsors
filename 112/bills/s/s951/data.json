Limits the latter program to 24 months. Makes the 12-year post-service period of eligibility for a VA rehabilitation program inapplicable with respect to the additional program.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the VA Secretary to follow-up (at least once every six months for a year and a half) on the employment status of veterans who participate in a VA rehabilitation program.\n\n(Sec. 6) Requires (current law encourages) participation by eligible members in the Transitional Assistance Program (TAP) of the Department of Defense (DOD). Requires (under current law, authorizes) the provision of preseparation counseling to members whose discharge or release is anticipated.\n\n(Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary of Labor to follow-up (at least three times over a one-year period) on the employment status of members who complete their participation in the TAP. Requires such Secretary to contract for TAP audits, to be conducted at least every three years. Requires audit reports.\n\n(Sec. 8) Directs the VA Secretary to award grants to up to three nonprofit organizations under a collaborative veterans' training, mentoring, and placement program for eligible veterans seeking employment. Requires program reports from such Secretary to the congressional veterans committees.
