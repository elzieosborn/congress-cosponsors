Requires such list to provide the participant's name and address, the participant's organizational affiliation, whether the participant represents an economic interest, a non-economic interest, a citizen interest, or an unknown interest, and whether any comment of the participant affected or did not affect the content of the final rule.\n\nRequires the RISC to: (1) compile and keep current such information obtained on non-federal participants in a searchable database made publicly available on the Internet, (2) make available quarterly trend and overview statistics, and (3) submit annual reports to Congress summarizing data received from agencies promulgating a rule."
