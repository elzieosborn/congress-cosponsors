Sets forth a congressional disapproval procedure for overriding OMB's recommendations.

Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement reforms under Medicare that result in reduced expenditures equal to $40 billion in each of FY2014-FY2023.
