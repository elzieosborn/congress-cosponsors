  <summary date="2012-04-27T15:40:40Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242) to extend through December 31, 2013, the freeze on any cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to the pay of certain federal civilian employees (thus extends such freeze from two to three calendar years).

Extends through such date the prohibition against receipt by a senior executive or senior-level employee of any increase in the rate of basic pay absent a change of position that results in a substantial increase in responsibility or a promotion.

Applies the pay limit freeze to Members of Congress.

Declares that no statutory COLA for a legislative branch employee which would otherwise take effect during the period beginning on enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2013, shall be made.</summary>
