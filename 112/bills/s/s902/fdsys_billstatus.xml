        <text><![CDATA[ <p>School Building Fairness Act of 2011 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to direct the Secretary of Education to allocate funds to states for competitive matching grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for school repair, renovation, and construction. </p> <p>Reserves 1% of the grant funds for assistance to outlying areas and Indian schools.</p> <p> Requires each state, in awarding such grants to LEAs, to consider: (1) the percentage of poor children each LEA serves; (2) the condition of their public schools or need for additional schools; (3) the extent to which they will comply with certain green building standards; (4) their fiscal capacity to cover repairs, renovations, and construction without such a grant; and (5) the likelihood that they will maintain repaired, renovated, or newly constructed schools in good condition.</p> <p>Requires each state to award high-need and rural LEAs, in the aggregate, at least the same proportion of this Act's LEA funds for the state that they received of total LEA school improvement funds for the state under part A of Title I of the ESEA.</p> <p>Directs each state to reserve a portion of their allocation for a state-level database of public school facility inventory, condition, design, and utilization.</p> <p>Requires the National Center for Education Statistics to study the condition of public elementary and secondary schools, including an analysis of trends in spending for their repair, renovation, and construction. </p> <p>Directs the Secretary to provide for the establishment of a clearinghouse of information on the best educational practices from nursery school through higher education, and the latest research regarding the construction, improvement, and maintenance of safe, healthy, and high-performance public schools.</p>]]></text>
