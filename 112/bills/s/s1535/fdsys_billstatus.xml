Allows a federal law enforcement agency or member of the intelligence community to delay&nbsp;notification if it determines that such notification would impede a lawful criminal investigation or authorized intelligence activity.</p> <p>(Sec. 212) Exempts an agency or business entity from the notification requirement if: (1) the U.S. Secret Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determines that notification of a security breach would reveal sensitive sources, impede law enforcement investigations, or cause damage to national security; or (2) the agency or entity conducts a risk assessment in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and concludes that there is no significant risk of a security breach and the FTC does not act to deny an exemption. Exempts from the requirements of this subtitle certain financial institutions subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and business entities subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).</p> <p>(Sec. 213) Sets forth the method of notice required for informing individuals of a security breach, including written notice to the last known home mailing address or email address of such individuals and public notice by electronic means or by general media if the sensitive personally identifiable information of more than 5,000 individuals is involved.</p> <p>(Sec. 214) Establishes requirements for the content of a notice to an individual whose sensitive personally identifiable information has been breached, including a description of the categories of such information, contact information, and a notice that such individual is entitled to a free consumer credit report on a quarterly basis for two years.</p> <p>(Sec. 215) Requires an agency or business entity&nbsp;that is required to provide notice of a security breach to provide at no cost to an individual whose sensitive personally identifiable information was breached a consumer credit report on a quarterly basis for a two-year period, a credit monitoring service, a security freeze on the individual's credit report, and compensation for damages incurred by an individual resulting from the security breach. </p> <p>(Sec. 216) Requires any agency or business entity that is required to notify more than 5,000&nbsp;individuals of a security breach to also notify consumer credit reporting agencies without unreasonable delay. </p> <p>(Sec. 217) Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Attorney General, to designate a federal entity (designated entity) to receive information and reports about information security incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities. Requires&nbsp;the designated entity to provide such information to the Secret Service, to the FBI, to the FTC for civil law enforcement purposes, and to other federal agencies for law enforcement, national security, or data security purposes. Requires business entities and agencies to notify the designated entity of a security breach within 10 days of discovery.</p> <p>(Sec. 218) Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action or request injunctive relief against any business entity that violates the requirements of this subtitle.

Allow agencies and business entities that are certified to review information in the clearinghouse to access such information to improve the security and reduce the vulnerability of networks that contain sensitive personally identifiable information.</p> <p>(Sec. 231) Requires the&nbsp;DHS designated entity to ensure that: (1) technical information disclosed to it is stored in a format designed to protect proprietary business information from inadvertent disclosure; and (2) all information stored in the technical information clearinghouse is presented in a form that minimizes the potential for such information to be traced to a particular network, company, or security breach incident. Exempts information in the technical information clearinghouse from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. </p> <p> <p><b>Title III: Access to and Use of Commercial Data</b> - (Sec. 301) Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), in considering contract awards totaling more than $500,000, to evaluate: (1) the data privacy and security program of a data broker and the broker's compliance with such program, (2) the extent to which databases and systems have been compromised by security breaches, and (3) data broker responses to such breaches.
