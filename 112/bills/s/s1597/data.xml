Prohibits the use of such grants: (1) for routine janitorial costs, (2) on facilities used for events for which the public is charged admission, or (3) on facilities which are used for sectarian purposes.

Requires states, in providing assistance to community college projects, to consider the extent to which the project complies with certain green building standards.

Limits the amount of time states and LEAs have to obligate this Act's grants and subgrants.
