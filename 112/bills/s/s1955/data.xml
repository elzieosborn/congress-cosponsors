  <summary date="2012-01-12T16:27:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Prohibits a federal department, agency, or court from taking any action that would prohibit, regulate, or otherwise restrict the interstate traffic of milk or a milk product that is unpasteurized and packaged for direct human consumption, if such restriction is based on the determination that solely because of being unpasteurized the milk or milk product is adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of federal law.</summary>
