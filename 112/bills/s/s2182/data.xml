  <summary date="2012-03-30T22:27:24Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Child Care Public-Private Partnership Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a business-incentive grant program to provide child care through public-private partnerships.

 Requires the Secretary to make such grants to: (1) states, on a competitive basis, to enable businesses and consortia to carry out certain activities; and (2) nonprofit business organizations with expertise in management issues of a high-quality child care center to provide technical information and assistance to enable businesses to provide child care services.

Specifies that grants to businesses and consortia are meant to enable them to: (1) pay start-up costs incurred to provide child care services, (2) assist with the costs of child care services needed by their employees, and (3) pay for training and professional development for staff that provide child care services.

Gives priority in grant selection to businesses with fewer than 100 full-time employees.</summary>
