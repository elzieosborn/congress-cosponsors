  <summary date="2011-10-12T16:10:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Transportation Security Administration Efficiency and Flexibility Act of 2011 - Excludes officers and employees of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from the right of federal employees to bargain collectively.

Subjects also to such exclusion the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) personnel management system as it applies to TSA employees.

Amends the Aviation and Transportation Security Act to provide that, notwithstanding the authority of the TSA Administrator to fix the terms and conditions of employment of TSA screeners, nothing shall prohibit such an employee from joining a labor organization.

Authorizes screeners to: (1) appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board adverse actions brought against them which are finalized after enactment of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, and (2) seek judicial review of any resulting Board orders or decisions.

Requires the FAA Administrator to provide to TSA screeners with a collaborative, integrated employee engagement mechanism to address workplace issues.

Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2003 to apply certain whistleblower protections to DHS employees.</summary>
