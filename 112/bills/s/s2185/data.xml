  <summary date="2012-04-16T18:42:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Abstinence Education Reallocation Act of 2012 - Authorizes the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to award grants for qualified sexual risk avoidance education to youth and their parents. Requires eligible education to meet certain criteria, including: (1) being age-appropriate, medically accurate, and evidence-based; (2) having as its sole purpose the teaching of the skills and benefits of sexual abstinence as the optimal sexual health behavior for youth; and (3) teaching the benefits of refraining from nonmarital sexual activity, the advantage of reserving sexual activity for marriage as a key factor in the prevention of poverty and the preservation of physical and emotional health, and the foundational components of a healthy relationship and the advantages of bearing children within the context of a committed marital relationship for healthy marriages.

Gives priority to programs that serve youth ages 12 to 19 and that will promote the protective benefits of parent-child communication regarding healthy sexual decision-making.</summary>
