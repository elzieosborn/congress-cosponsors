    "text": "Effective Interrogation of Unprivileged Enemy Belligerents Act - Amends the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 to require the Secretary of Defense (DOD), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the Attorney General to jointly submit to Congress procedures for the interrogation of unprivileged enemy belligerents who are suspected of possessing significant information and who are under the control and custody of the United States or a foreign government, entity, or law enforcement or intelligence agency that is providing access to the United States for the purpose of interrogation. Requires such procedures to include the creation of an entity composed of representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and any other appropriate element of the intelligence community or DOD, which shall have primary responsibility for the interrogation of such belligerents. Requires the Secretary, upon conclusion of an interrogation, to determine the individual's status and disposition.\n\nRequires the DNI to notify the congressional intelligence committees semiannually of the identities of any unprivileged enemy belligerents who have been interrogated or determined to meet the requirements for interrogation.\n\nDirects the Secretary to notify Congress: (1) within 60 days after any modifications to the interrogation procedures, and (2) within ten days after the authorization of an exception to such procedures."
