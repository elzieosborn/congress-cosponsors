  <summary date="2011-10-25T15:07:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Education for Tomorrow's Jobs Act - Amends part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require local educational agencies receiving subgrants under part A to describe how they will establish and carry out a school improvement program, including how they will:

 create a network of schools or programs of study that integrate a rigorous curriculum emphasizing college and career readiness, and wraparound support services; use school-level strategies to personalize students' educational experience; demonstrate their capacity to implement and sustain their program; involve institutions of higher education, employers, community-based organizations, parent organizations, and other stakeholders in the school improvement process; provide school staff and other stakeholders with high-quality training and technical assistance; facilitate student transitions from secondary schools that do not award diplomas to secondary schools that do, and from the latter to postsecondary education; enable their program through policies that may include budgeting, governance, curriculum, and scheduling autonomies; place students, when possible, in a school or program of study that the student or their parents choose; ensure that students are able to fully participate in their school or program of study and are not placed in a school or program of study on the basis of their prior academic achievement or status as a poor, minority, disabled, or limited English proficient student; and arrange for an ongoing and rigorous evaluation of their program, and disseminate best practices.</summary>
