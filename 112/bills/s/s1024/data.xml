  <summary date="2011-06-23T16:27:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Organ Mountains--Dona Ana County Conservation and Protection Act - Designates specified wilderness areas in New Mexico and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as wilderness and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS).

Designates certain BLM land as a potential wilderness area, and upon publication of a notice in the Federal Register, as wilderness and as a component of the NWPS and incorporated into the Robledo Mountains Wilderness.

Releases certain public land in Dona Ana County that was not designated as wilderness by this Act from further study for designation as wilderness.

 Establishes certain BLM-managed lands in the county as the Organ Mountains and Desert Peaks National Conservation Areas. Requires the development of separate management plans for such areas.

Transfers administrative jurisdiction over certain land from the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to the Secretary of the Interior to become part of Organ Mountains National Conservation Area.

 Requires the Conservation Areas and the designated wilderness areas to be administered as components of the National Landscape Conservation System.

 Amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to adjust the boundary of the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument.

Closes an identified route excluded from the Potrillo Mountains Wilderness to public access but makes it available for law enforcement uses, including border security.</summary>
