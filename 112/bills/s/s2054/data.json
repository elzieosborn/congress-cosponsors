Requires the Secretary to transfer returned amounts to a specified account in the Treasury to reduce the public debt.\n\nStates that any executive officer or employee whose compensation is affected by this Act shall not be considered a federal employee.\n\nRequires the Director to report annually to specified congressional committees, and to make publicly available, the rate of compensation and benefits of all GES executives and employees, without disclosing their names or other personal information."
