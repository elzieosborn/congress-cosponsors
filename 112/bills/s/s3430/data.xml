Sets forth the duties of the Commission, which shall include: (1) evaluating HHS programs, (2) identifying current activities and critical gaps in federal efforts to support clinicians in providing care to people with pre-diabetes and diabetes, (3) recommending how an outcomes-based registry may be developed and then used to evaluate various care models and methods, (4) evaluating and expanding education and awareness to health care professionals regarding clinical practices for the prevention of diabetes and the precursor conditions of diabetes, and (5) reviewing and recommending appropriate methods for outreach and dissemination of educational resources related to diabetes prevention and treatments.

Requires the Commission to submit to the Secretary and Congress an operating plan for carrying out the activities of the Commission that may include specific activities the Commission plans to conduct, a plan for completing the activities, a budget for such activities, and a plan for evaluating the value and potential impact of the Commission's work and recommendations, including the possible continuation of the Commission for purposes of overseeing their implementation.</summary>
