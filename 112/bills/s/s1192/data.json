Permits a participating tribe to impose specified sanctions. Requires the Office of Justice Services of the Department of the Interior to carry out a contract program for the employment by Indian tribes of Village Peace Officers in Alaska Native villages.\n\nAuthorizes Alaska, its political subdivisions, Indian tribes in Alaska, and the federal government to enter into intergovernmental agreements, including agreements concerning: (1) the employment of law enforcement officers, probation, and parole officers; (2) the cross-appointment and cross-deputization of tribal, state, municipal, or federal officials; (3) the detention or incarceration of offenders; and (4) jurisdictional or financial matters."
