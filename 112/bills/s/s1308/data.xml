  <summary date="2011-08-25T21:38:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit knowingly conducting in interstate or foreign commerce a financial transaction that will facilitate access to, or the possession of, child pornography. Exempts a financial transaction conducted by a person in cooperation with, or with the consent of, a law enforcement agency.

Adds as predicate offenses to the money laundering statute provisions regarding: (1) such financial facilitation of access to child pornography, (2) obscene visual representation of the abuse of children, and (3) a felony by a registered sex offender involving a minor.

Requires a provider of an electronic communication service or remote computing service to retain for at least 18 months a log of the temporarily assigned network addresses the service assigns to each subscriber account unless that address is transmitted by radio communication. Bars any cause of action against a provider for retaining records as required. Makes a good faith reliance on the requirement to retain records a complete defense to a civil action. Expresses the sense of Congress that such records should be stored securely to protect customer privacy and prevent breaches of the records.

Allows the issuance of an administrative subpoena for the investigation of unregistered sex offenders by the United States Marshals Service.

Requires a U.S. district court to issue a protective order prohibiting harassment or intimidation of a minor victim or witness if the court finds evidence that the conduct at issue is reasonably likely to adversely affect the willingness of the minor witness or victim to testify or otherwise participate in a federal criminal case or investigation.

Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review and amend the federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements to ensure that such guidelines provide an additional penalty for sex trafficking of children and other child abuse crimes.

Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to 20 years for the possession of pornographic images of a child under the age of 12.</summary>
