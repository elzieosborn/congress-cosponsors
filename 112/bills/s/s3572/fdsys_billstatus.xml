        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small Businesses Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend temporarily: (1) the 100% exclusion from gross income of gain from the sale or exchange of small business stock, (2) the offset against the alternative minimum tax of general business tax credits, (3) the five-year carryback of tax credit amounts of eligible small businesses, (4) a reduction from 10 to 5 years in the recognition period for built-in gains of S corporations, (5) the increased expensing of depreciable business assets, (6) the special tax rule for long-term contract accounting, (7) the increased tax deduction for small business start-up expenditures, and (8) the tax deduction for health insurance premiums in computing self-employment taxable income.</p> <p>Defines &quot;economic impact&quot; with respect to a proposed or final regulatory rule to mean: (1) any direct economic effect of a rule on small entities, and (2) any reasonably foreseeable economic economic effect on such entities.</p> <p>Permits small entities to seek judicial review of initial regulatory flexibility analyses and to obtain an injunction of a proposed rule that is noncompliant with Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requirements. Requires each agency to establish a plan for the review, every nine years, of: (1) its rules that have a significant adverse economic impact on small entities, and (2) any small entity compliance guide required to be published by an agency. Expands to additional agencies the procedures for gathering comments on rules that will have a significant economic impact on small entities. Extends RFA requirements to any significant agency guidance documents.</p> <p>Amends the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 to require each agency to review biennially the civil penalties it imposes on small entities for violations of statutory or regulatory requirements.</p> <p>Imposes additional requirements on agencies prior to the issuance of a final rule, including: (1) the cumulative economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities, and (2) requiring the agency to notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) of draft rules that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Requires agencies to publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis with respect to any proposed rule that it determines will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Allows the Chief Counsel to comment on agency regulatory action that affects small businesses. Requires the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to include, in a required annual report, specified data and tables describing agency rules.</p> <p>EXCEL Act of 2012- Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to: (1) authorize the SBA Administrator to guarantee the payment of up to $4 billion per fiscal year for debentures or participating securities issued by small business investment companies (SBICs) to encourage the formation and growth of small businesses, (2) increase the maximum amount of outstanding leverage for two or more commonly-controlled SBICs, (3) authorize annual inflationary adjustments of such limits, (4) direct the Administrator to make publicly available specified fiscal and related information with respect to each SBIC, and (5) allow SBIC licensing fees to be used for SBIC program needs other than the costs of licensing examinations. Expresses the sense of Congress supporting SBIC partnerships with community banks and other lenders.</p> <p>Amends the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to extend through March 27, 2014 (under current law, through September 27, 2012) the authority for SBA refinancing of small business debt not involving business expansion under the SBA's local development business loan program.</p> <p>Directs the Administrator to develop and submit to Congress a plan for using SBA entrepreneurial development programs to create jobs during FY2013-FY2014.</p> <p>Women's Small Business Ownership Act of 2012 - Directs the SBA's Office of Women's Business Ownership to address issues concerning the management, operations, manufacturing, technology, finance, retail and product sales, international trade, government contracting, and other disciplines required for starting, operating, and increasing the business of a small business.
