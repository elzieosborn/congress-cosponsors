    "text": "Revises state agency authority with respect to operation of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities. Replaces the exception from general HOV restrictions for low emission and energy-efficient vehicles with one for alternative fuel vehicles and new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles.\n\nAuthorizes a state agency (including a state transportation department) with jurisdiction over the operation of an HOV facility to permit alternative fuel vehicles and new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles to use HOV lane highways. Requires states to establish procedures for enforcing restrictions on such vehicles operating on HOV lane highways.\n\nRequires a state agency which collects tolls on HOV facilities for their use by vehicles not otherwise exempted from HOV restrictions to use excess toll revenues for certain highway projects, giving priority consideration to those for developing alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel and projects for improving highway safety.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Transportation and states should provide additional incentives (including the use of HOV lanes on state Interstate System highways and routes) for the purchase and use of advanced technology and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles."
