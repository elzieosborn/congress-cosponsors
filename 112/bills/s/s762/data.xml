Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act of 2011 - Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 to provide that the Associate Administrator for Acquisition Workforce Programs shall: (1) be chosen on the basis of demonstrated knowledge and expertise in acquisition, human capital, and management; (2) be located in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy; and (3) implement acquisition workforce programs.

Establishes a Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and enumerates its purposes with respect to the development of a professional acquisition workforce.

Requires: (1) the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to recommend to the Administrator of General Services (GSA) sufficient budget resources and authority for the FAI to support government-wide training standards and certification requirements necessary to enhance the mobility and career opportunities of the federal acquisition workforce, and (2) the GSA Administrator to provide FAI with amounts from the acquisition training fund sufficient to meet the annual budget for FAI requested by the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy.

Directs: (1) the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, acting through FAI, to provide and update government-wide training standards and certification requirements; and (2) all federal civilian agency acquisition internship or acquisition training programs to follow guidelines provided by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to ensure consistent training standards necessary to develop uniform core competencies throughout the federal government.
