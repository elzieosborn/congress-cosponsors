Requires infrastructure projects assisted under this Act to have costs that are reasonably anticipated to equal or exceed $100 million ($25 million for rural infrastructure projects).\n\nSets forth special requirements for infrastructure projects in rural areas. Establishes an Office of Rural Assistance to provide technical assistance in the development and financing of rural infrastructure projects.\n\nEstablishes an Office of Special Inspector General to conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations of the business activities of AIFA.\n\nProhibits financial assistance from AIFA for any private project for which no public benefit is created. Sets forth terms for loans or loan guarantees for infrastructure projects and for the repayment of such loans. Requires an annual independent audit of AIFA finances.\n\nRequires the Chief Executive Officer of AIFA to: (1) establish fees with respect to loans and loan guarantees that are sufficient to cover AIFA's administrative costs, and (2) take actions to make AIFA a self-sustaining entity, with administrative and federal credit subsidy costs fully funded by fees and risk premiums on loans and loan guarantees.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to extend through 2012 the exemption from alternative minimum tax (AMT) for tax-exempt private activity bonds."
