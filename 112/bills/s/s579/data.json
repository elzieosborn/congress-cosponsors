Directs the Secretary to refer such member to a private provider upon determining that such provider will ensure that the member will receive treatment and assistance without delay.\n\nRequires annual reports from the Secretary to Congress on the number of members so referred, as well as their health and career status, and any situations that may be impeding the counseling calls from reaching all appropriate members.\n\nRequires a one-time report from the Comptroller General to Congress on suicide among such members.\n\nDirects the Secretary to develop, evaluate, and more widely disseminate programs that promote: (1) connectivity between members of the Armed Forces and their family, peers, and immediate chain of command; and (2) suicide risk identification and response, with particular emphasis on members of reserve components."
