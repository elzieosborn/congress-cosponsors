Requires the Administrator, in making such determinations, to: (1) identify any actions that could be taken to enable such flag capacity to meet the national defense requirements, (2) provide each such determination to the Secretary of Transportation and the head of the agency for which the determination is made, and (3) publish each such determination on the Internet site of the Department of Transportation (DOT) within 48 hours after it is provided to the Secretary.\n\nDirects the Secretary to notify Congress of any waiver requests or issuances. Requires the notification of the issuance of a waiver to include the reasons why: (1) the waiver is necessary, and (2) specified actions are not feasible."
