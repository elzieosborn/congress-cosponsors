    "text": "Made in America Block Grant Program Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Made in America Block Grant Program under which the Secretary is authorized to make grants to eligible entities to support the U.S. manufacturing industry. Allows such grants to be used, with respect to small and medium-sized manufacturers, for: (1) retooling or retrofitting, (2) business plan diversification, (3) improving energy or process efficiency, (4) employee training and retraining, (5) the provision of capital and technical expertise, and (6) a revolving loan fund for such manufacturers to finance the costs of such activities. Outlines provisions concerning eligible entities, the allocation of grant funds, and requirements for grant recipients, including the submission of a proposed manufacturing enhancement strategy.\n\nRequires: (1) the Secretary, to the degree practicable, to carry out the program through the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program; and (2) a manufacturer receiving funds for an activity to only use such funds to carry out such activity in the United States.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish an advisory committee for advice in implementing and evaluating the program. Authorizes the Secretary to review and evaluate recipient performance under the program. Requires the Comptroller General to study the program, and report study results to Congress.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that program amounts should supplement and not supplant other funding provided by federal agencies to support the manufacturing industry."
