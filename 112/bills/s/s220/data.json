    "text": "Oregon Eastside Forests Restoration, Old Growth Protection, and Jobs Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), through the Chief of the Forest Service, in a covered area of Oregon to seek to: (1) conserve and restore forest and watershed health and other ecosystems; (2) reduce the risk of, and increase the resistance and resiliency of the land to, uncharacteristic disturbances; (3) allow for characteristic natural disturbances; and (4) harvest wood to maintain adequate levels of industry infrastructure to accomplish such goals. Defines \"covered area\" as area selected by the Secretary that is within Oregon and that is not within the area covered by the Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl, dated April 1994.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) implement covered area ecological restoration projects to help achieve the above goals, and (2) offer, and promptly implement, covered area mechanical treatment projects emphasizing sawtimber as a byproduct.\n\nRequires each vegetation management project to protect and restore aquatic and riparian-dependent resources.\n\nEstablishes the Eastside Forest Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel to advise the Secretary, collaborative groups, and the public about the development and implementation of goals to improve forest and watershed health and related social and economic goals.\n\nRequires the Secretary to develop a strategy to assist in the implementation of projects needed to accomplish the purposes of this Act."
