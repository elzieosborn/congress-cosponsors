The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p> <p>Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011 - <b>Title I: Jurisdictional Improvements</b> - (Sec. 101) Amends the federal judicial code to declare that, with respect to diversity of citizenship, the U.S. district courts shall not have original jurisdiction of any civil action between citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States and are domiciled in the same state.</p> <p>(Sec. 102) Modifies the citizenship rules to treat corporations as citizens of any foreign state: (1) by which it has been incorporated, and (2) where it has its principal place of business.
