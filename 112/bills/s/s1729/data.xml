  <summary date="2011-12-15T21:32:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to exclude manure from the definition of "hazardous substance" and "pollutant or contaminant" for purposes of such Act. Defines "manure" to mean: (1) digestive emissions, feces, urine, urea and other excrement from livestock; (2) any associated bedding, compost, raw materials or other materials commingled with such excrement from livestock; (3) any process water associated with such items; and (4) any byproducts, constituents, or substances contained in, or originating from, such items or any emissions relating to such items.

Amends the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 to exempt from notification requirements applicable to releases from facilities of hazardous substances any release associated with manure as defined under CERCLA.</summary>
