  <summary date="2012-01-30T21:18:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Requires, in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary of Defense (DOD), that assistance be available under the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program for pursuit of a master's and doctoral degree in the disciplines of physical and occupational therapy.

Terminates the availability of assistance for either such discipline when the Secretary certifies that there no longer exists a current or projected shortfall in qualified personnel in that discipline in either the military departments or any major military medical treatment facility specializing in the rehabilitation of wounded Armed Forces members.

Declares that assistance under this Act, if not already terminated, shall expire two years after enactment of this Act, provided that such expiration is not construed to terminate ongoing assistance to persons provided assistance before or as of such date.</summary>
