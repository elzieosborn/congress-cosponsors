Authorizes the USTR, however, not to take any action if it is not in the U.S. national interest.\n\nRequires the USTR to seek public participation in developing such reports and in determining what action, if any, to take with respect to any commitment the Russian Federation is not implementing or is not making progress toward implementing in a timely manner."
