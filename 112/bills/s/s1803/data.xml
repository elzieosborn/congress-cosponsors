  <summary date="2011-11-23T15:25:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Permanent Guarantee of Sensible Treatment of Farm Dust Act of 2011-&#160;Prohibits&#160;the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from&#160; proposing, finalizing, implementing, or enforcing any regulation revising the national primary ambient air quality standard or the national secondary ambient air quality standard applicable to nuisance dust with an aerodynamic diameter greater than 2.5 micrometers under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

Exempts nuisance dust from the CAA and excludes nuisance dust from&#160;references in such Act to particulate matter, except with&#160;respect to geographical areas where such dust is not regulated under state, tribal, or local law&#160;if the Administrator finds that: (1) nuisance dust (or any subcategory of nuisance dust) causes substantial adverse public health and welfare effects at ambient concentrations; and (2) the benefits of applying CAA standards and other requirements to such dust outweigh the costs.

Defines "nuisance dust" as particulate matter: (1) generated from natural sources, unpaved roads, agricultural activities, earth moving, or other activities typically conducted in rural areas; or (2) consisting primarily of soil, other natural or biological materials, windblown dust, or some combination thereof.</summary>
