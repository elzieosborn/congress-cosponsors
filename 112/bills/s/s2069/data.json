    "text": "Spending Reductions through Innovations in Therapies Agenda Act of 2012 or the SPRINT Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the Spending Reductions through Innovations in Therapies Program (SPRINT Program) to support development of therapies to reduce spending by federal health care programs for high-cost chronic conditions. Requires the Program to: (1) accelerate advanced research and development of such therapies, and (2) encourage innovation in technologies that may assist such research to reduce the time and cost of therapy development.\n\nRequires the Secretary to select the high-cost chronic conditions that shall be the focus of the Program from conditions among the top 10 leading causes of death designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that have: (1) the highest current and projected cost to federal health care programs and high long-term care costs; (2) a likelihood of impairing the ability of an individual to carry out activities of daily living, which can result in the individual becoming dependent on caregivers; (3) a death rate that has increased and is projected to increase significantly in future years; and (4) a lack of existing therapies to prevent, control, or cure the condition or delay cognitive decline.\n\nSets forth the duties of the Secretary, including to: (1) partner with certain nonprofit strategic investment entities, (2) reduce the time and cost barriers between laboratory discoveries and clinical trials for therapies used to treat high-cost chronic conditions, and (3) facilitate innovative and expedited review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the therapies developed.\n\nEstablishes a SPRINT Award Program, under which the Secretary may award contracts or grants to public, nonprofit, early stage companies or growth companies to support advanced research and the development of therapies. Sets forth matching fund requirements. Requires the Secretary to evaluate projects funded."
