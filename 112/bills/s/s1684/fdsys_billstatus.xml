Requires the Secretary to give a tribe written notice of an appraisal's rejection. Requires that notice to describe how the appraisal should be amended to meet standards the Secretary will establish.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) Amends the Long-Term Leasing Act to authorize the Navajo Nation to enter into commercial or agricultural leases of up to 99 years on their restricted lands without the Secretary's approval, provided they are executed under tribal regulations approved by the Secretary. (Currently, those leases may not exceed 25 years but may include an option to renew for up to 2 additional terms, neither of which may exceed 25 years.)</p> <p>Allows the Navajo Nation to enter into mineral resource leases on their restricted lands without the Secretary's approval if they are executed under approved tribal regulations and do not exceed 25 years, though they may include a renewal option for one additional term not exceeding 25 years. Allows such leases for oil and gas to be for terms of up to 10 years, plus any additional period the Navajo Nation determines to be appropriate if oil or gas is being produced in a paying quantity.</p> <p>Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress, within five years of this Act's enactment, on the progress made regarding such leases. </p>]]></text>
