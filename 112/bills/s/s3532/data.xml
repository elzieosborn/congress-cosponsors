Preempts any state law which would directly or indirectly prohibit or restrict the inclusion in any church plan of an automatic contribution arrangement.

Allows church plans and their supporting organizations to invest plan assets in a group trust (as defined by Internal Revenue Service Revenue Rulings).</summary>
