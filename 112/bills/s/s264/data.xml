Natchez Trace Parkway Land Conveyance Act of 2011 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to convey to Mississippi, by quitclaim deed and without consideration, all interest of the United States in two parcels of land totaling approximately 67 acres that are identified on a map entitled "Natchez Trace Parkway, Proposed Boundary Change."

Requires the deed of conveyance to the parcel of land located southeast of U.S. route 61/84, and which is commonly known as the bean field property, to reserve an easement to the United States that restricts the use of such parcel only to uses which are compatible with the Parkway.

Adjusts the boundary of the Parkway to exclude the conveyed land and provides for inclusion in the Parkway of the approximately ten acres identified as the proposed addition.</summary>
