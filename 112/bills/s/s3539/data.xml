  <summary date="2012-09-26T19:47:09Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Medicaid Information Technology to Enhance Community Health Act of 2012 or MITECH Act - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to extend payments to encourage the adoption and use of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology to qualified safety net clinics (QSNCs).

Defines a QSNC as a clinic or network of clinics operated by a private non-profit or public entity at least 30% percent of whose patient volume is attributable to needy individuals.

Defines a "QSNC-based" individual as one who furnishes substantially all of his or her professional services in a QSNC and through use of the clinic's facilities and equipment, including qualified EHRs.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a procedure through which a QSNC may demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in order to receive incentive payments.</summary>
