Requires peer reviewers to review waiver requests in their totality, in deference to state and local judgment, and with the goal of promoting state and local innovation.\n\nGives the Secretary a limited amount of time to decide on a waiver request. Gives requesters opportunities to revise their requests.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from imposing conditions on a waiver that require the state, LEA, or Indian tribe to adopt or drop specific standards or assessment systems."
