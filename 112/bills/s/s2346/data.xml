  <summary date="2012-06-05T20:20:55Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Forest Products Fairness Act of 2012 - Amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to redefine "biobased product" as a commercial or industrial product (other than food or feed) that is composed, in whole or in significant part, of biological products, including renewable domestic agricultural materials and forestry materials, or an intermediate ingredient or feedstock.

Includes within such definition forest products that meet biobased content requirements, notwithstanding market maturity.

Defines "forest product" as a product made from materials derived from the practice of forestry or the management of growing timber, and includes: (1) pulp, paper, paperboard, pellets, and wood products; and (2) any recycled products derived from forest materials.</summary>
