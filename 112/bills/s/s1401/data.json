    "text": "Pacific Salmon Stronghold Conservation Act of 2011 - (Sec. 3) Defines \"salmon stronghold\" as a defined geographical unit meeting biological criteria for abundance, productivity, diversity (genetic and life history), habitat quality, or other biological attributes important to sustaining viable salmon populations throughout their range, as defined by the Salmon Stronghold Partnership Board (the Board) established by this Act.\n\n(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to establish the Salmon Stronghold Partnership as a cooperative, incentive-based, public-private partnership working across political boundaries and land ownerships to identify and conserve salmon strongholds.\n\n Requires the Board, to the extent possible, to include: (1) representatives of Alaska, California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington state; (2) specified federal entities; (3) nongovernmental organizations; (4) representatives from Indian tribes; and (5) a national or regional representative from associated counties.\n\n(Sec. 5) Requires the Assistant Administrator for the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to carry out information and assessment functions associated with salmon strongholds and conservation planning.\n\n(Sec. 6) Establishes a salmon stronghold watershed grants and technical assistance program to fund program administration, assist locally with a network of local authorities and private entities, provide financial assistance, accelerate recovery plans for threatened or endangered salmon populations, and other stronghold protection and restoration activities. Sets forth guidelines for program selection, prioritization, and funding to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) or qualified states with a competitive grant process. Limits the federal share of the cost of a project on nonfederal land to 50%.\n\n(Sec. 7) Directs federal agencies responsible for managing federal land within a stronghold to cooperate with the Assistant Administrator and the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).\n\n(Sec. 8) Authorizes the sharing of status and trends data, innovative conservation strategies, conservation planning methodologies, and other information with North Pacific countries, including Canada, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, and appropriate international entities to promote salmon conservation and habitat.\n\n(Sec. 9) Prohibits acquiring private property without the owner's consent. Requires the deed of any real property that the Secretary of the Interior transfers for a conservation project to contain a reversion of title to the United States if the owner fails to manage the property in accordance with this Act.\n\n(Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter cooperative agreements, contracts, and grants; (2) accept donations; (3) participate in interagency financing; and (4) provide funds and donated property to federal agencies.\n\n(Sec. 12) Requires the Assistant Administrator to submit a report to Congress at least once every three years."
