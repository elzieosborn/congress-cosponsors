Requires a website operator that does not possess information on a destination's health and safety services to request it from that destination.\n\nGrants the website operator immunity from liability relating to inaccurate or incomplete information if such information was provided by the destination and the operator published it without knowledge that it was inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nTreats a violation as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n\nAmends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to require the Secretary of State to: (1) collect and include in the database on overseas deaths of U.S. citizens from non-natural causes information on the name and address of the property where a death occurred, and (2) update the database not less frequently than once each month (currently, every six months) and to report such updated information to Congress."
