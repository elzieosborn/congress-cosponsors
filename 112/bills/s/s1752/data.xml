  <summary date="2012-02-13T22:56:24Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Freedom to Breathe Act of 2011 - Nullifies the final rule entitled "Use of Ozone-Depleting Substances; Removal of Essential-Use Designation (Epinephrine)."

Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from reissuing such rule in substantially the same form or issuing a new rule that prohibits the production and distribution of oral pressurized metered-dose inhalers because such inhalers may emit greenhouse gas emissions, unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after this Act's enactment.</summary>
