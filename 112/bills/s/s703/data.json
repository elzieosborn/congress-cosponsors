(The Secretary must still approve the tribal regulations under which those leases are executed and mining leases still require the Secretary's approval.)\n\nSets forth the environmental review process required under tribal lease regulations before those regulations obtain the Secretary's approval. Requires the process to identify and evaluate any significant effects a proposed lease may have on the environment and allow public comment on those effects.\n\nAllows tribes to rely on a federal environmental review process rather than the tribal environmental review process if the project under review is federally funded.\n\nDirects the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to report to Congress on the history and experience of Indian tribes that have chosen to assume the BIA's responsibility for operating the Indian Land Title and Records Office."
