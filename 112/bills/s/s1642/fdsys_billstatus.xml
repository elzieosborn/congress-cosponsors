        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p> <p>United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act - <b>Title I: Approval of, and General Provisions Relating to, the Agreement</b> - (Sec. 101) Approves the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (the Agreement) entered into on June 30, 2007, with the government of Korea, and the statement of administrative action proposed to implement the Agreement, both submitted to Congress on October 3, 2011. Allows for the Agreement's entry into force upon certain conditions being met on or after January 1, 2012.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) Authorizes the President to proclaim actions, and other appropriate officers of the U.S. government to issue regulations, necessary to ensure appropriate implementation of any provision of this Act that takes effect on the date the Agreement enters into force. Declares that proclaimed actions that are not subject to consultation and layover requirements under this Act shall not take effect before the 15th day after the text of the proclamation is published in the Federal Register. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) Permits presidential proclamations calling for action under this Act to be proclaimed only if: (1) the President has obtained advice regarding the proposed action from the appropriate advisory committees and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), (2) the President has reported to specified congressional committees with respect to such action, (3) a period of 60 days has expired, and (4) the President has consulted with the appropriate congressional committees during such 60-day period. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Authorizes the President to establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office to provide administrative assistance to dispute settlement panels established under the Agreement. Authorizes appropriations.</p><p>(Sec. 106) Authorizes the United States to resolve any claim against it covered by the Agreement, pursuant to the Investor-State Dispute Settlement procedures set forth in the Agreement.</p><p><b>Title II: Customs Provisions - </b>(Sec. 201) Authorizes the President to proclaim necessary or appropriate modifications or continuation of duty, continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or additional duties to carry out the Agreement. </p> <p>Authorizes the President, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of this Act, to deem as necessary or appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions provided for by the Agreement such: (1) modifications or continuation of any duty, (2) modifications as the United States may agree to with Korea regarding the staging of any duty treatment specified in the Agreement, (3) continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or (4) additional duties.</p> <p>Authorizes the President to proclaim the tariff treatment of certain imported Korean motor vehicles based on certain formulae.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) Prescribes certain rules of origin with respect to the reduction and elimination of duties imposed by the United States and Korea on certain goods wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of the other country. Prescribes a special rule for certain automotive goods. Specifies content requirements allowing certain textile and apparel goods to be considered originating goods. </p> <p>(Sec. 203) Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) to prohibit the charge of a fee for certain customs services with respect to originating goods under the Agreement. Prohibits any service exempted from such fees from being funded with money from the Customs User Fee Account.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to exempt: (1) an importer from penalties for making an incorrect claim that a good qualifies as an originating good under the Agreement if the importer voluntarily and promptly makes a corrected declaration and pays any duties owing; and (2) an exporter or producer from penalties for making false certifications of origin under the Agreement if such person, promptly after issuing such certification, has reason to believe that it contains or is based on incorrect information, and voluntarily provides a written notice to every recipient of it.</p> <p> Exempts persons from penalties if: (1) the information was correct at the time it was provided in a Korea Free Trade Agreement (KFTA) certification of origin but was later rendered incorrect because of a change in circumstances; and (2) the person promptly and voluntarily provides written notice of the change in circumstances to all recipients of such certification.</p> <p>Declares that, if the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security finds indications of a pattern of conduct by an importer, exporter, or producer of false or unsupported representations that goods qualify under the rules of origin, CBP may suspend preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement for entries of identical goods covered by subsequent representations by the individuals until it determines that the representations conform with such rules.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) Authorizes the CBP/ICE (formerly the U.S. Customs Service) to reliquidate an entry and refund any excess duties (including merchandise processing fees) paid on a good qualifying under the rules of origin for which no claim for preferential treatment was made at the time of importation if the importer takes certain actions within one year after such importation.</p> <p>(Sec. 206) Requires a person who issues a KFTA certification of origin for a good exported from the United States to make, keep for at least five years after such certification is issued, and render for examination and inspection all records and supporting documents related to such certification.</p> <p>(Sec. 207) Authorizes the President to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, during the period of a verification procedure by the government of Korea, to determine: (1) that an exporter or producer in Korea is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, procedures, requirements, and practices affecting trade in textile or apparel goods; or (2) that a claim is accurate that such a good exported or produced by such exporter or producer qualifies as an originating good, or is a good of Korea.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary, as an appropriate action authorized by the President, to suspend liquidation of the entry of any textile or apparel good that a person subject to such verification: (1) that a person has produced or exported in cases where the request for verification was based on a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity, and (2) for which a claim has been made that such good is an originating good or is a good of Korea.</p> <p>Authorizes the President to direct the Secretary to deny preferential treatment and entry into the United States to such textile and apparel goods if the information obtained from verification is insufficient to make a determination. </p> <p> Authorizes the Secretary to publish the name of any person engaged in intentional circumvention of applicable laws, regulations, or procedures affecting trade in such goods, or who has failed to demonstrate that it produces or is capable of producing them.</p> <p>Authorizes the Commissioner responsible for CPB to require an importer to submit a certificate of eligibility, properly completed and signed by an authorized official of the government of Korea, at the time the importer files a claim for preferential tariff treatment under Annex 4-B of the Agreement. </p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon request of the government of a country that is a party to a free trade agreement, to request a verification of the production of any textile or apparel good in order to assist that government in determining whether: (1) a claim of origin under the agreement for a textile or apparel good is accurate; or (2) an exporter, producer, or other enterprise located in the United States involved in the movement of textile or apparel goods from the United States to the territory of the requesting government is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, and procedures regarding trade in textile or apparel goods. <p><b>Title III: Relief From Imports - Subtitle A: Relief From Imports Benefiting From the Agreement - </b>(Sec. 311) Authorizes an entity (including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers) to petition the ITC for an adjustment to U.S. obligations under the Agreement. Requires the ITC, upon the filing of a petition, to investigate promptly whether, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for under the Agreement, a Korean article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry producing an article like, or directly competitive with, the imported article.
