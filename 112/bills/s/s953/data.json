Requires the Secretary to decide whether to issue a permit within 30 days after receiving an application. Allows up to two 15-day extensions of such deadline. Prescribes implementation procedures.\n\nImposes a deadline for a final decision on certain permit applications under existing leases.\n\nDirects the Secretary to extend by one year the terms of certain oil and gas leases (covered leases) for the Gulf of Mexico outer Continental Shelf (OCS) region.\n\nEstablishes any district court within the Fifth Circuit as the exclusive venue for civil actions relating to covered energy projects on leased federal land in the Gulf of Mexico unless there is no proper venue within that circuit.\n\nBars such a civil action unless it is filed within 60 days after the final federal action to which it relates.\n\nSets forth a standard of review under which: (1) the court is directed to hear and determine any covered civil action as expeditiously as possible; and (2) any judicial review of a covered civil action makes a presumption that the administrative findings and conclusions relating to the challenged federal action or decision are correct.\n\nSets restrictions on prospective relief.\n\nProhibits federal payment of attorneys' fees, expenses, and other court costs to any party in a covered civil action under this Act."
