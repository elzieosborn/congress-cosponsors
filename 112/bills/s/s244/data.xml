Sets forth provisions that may be made inapplicable within a state, including provisions related to health coverage, essential health benefits, health insurance exchanges, alternative health plans established by states, individual and employer health coverage requirements,&#160;interoperable protocols for enrollment in federal and state health and human service programs, and expansion of Medicaid coverage.</summary>
