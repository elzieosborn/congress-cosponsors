Allows such service-connection to be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\n\nProvides the same conditions (with the same authorized rebuttal) with respect to acceptance of proof of service-connection of certain mental health conditions alleged to have been incurred or aggravated by military sexual trauma experienced during active military service."
