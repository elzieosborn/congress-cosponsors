Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) offer for a fee premium visitor visa processing (absent security concerns, within three business days of visa request); (2) decrease nonimmigrant visa application and issuance fees in selected countries when there is a low demand from such countries for visitor visas; and (3) conduct interviews and review applications within 15 days after an applicant's appointment request, and within one year after enactment of this Act, within 10 days after such request.

States that the premium fee shall be sufficient to cover costs for: (1) processing such visas in China, India, and Brazil; and (2) creating mobile units to process applications and conduct interviews in large cities that do not have a U.S. embassy or consulate.

Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to admit into the United States a qualifying Canadian citizen over 50 years old and spouse and children, for a period of at least 240 days, if the person owns a U.S. residence or has rented a U.S. accommodation for the duration of such stay.

Revises the visa waiver program to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate any country as a program country; (2) adjust visa refusal rate criteria, including addition of a 3% maximum overstay rate; and (3) revise probationary and termination provisions.
