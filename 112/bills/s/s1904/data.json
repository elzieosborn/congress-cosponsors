(Work activation means, not employment, but supervised job search, community service activities, education and job training, workfare, or drug and alcohol treatment.)\n\nSpecifies a financial reward for any state that reduces its food stamp caseload below calendar 2006 levels.\n\nDeclares that a food, food product, meal, or other specified item shall be considered a food under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 only if it is a bare essential.\n\nRequires the President to include means-tested welfare spending in every budget submission.\n\nAmends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to define and establish an aggregate cap for means-tested welfare spending.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide grants to states to reward reductions in poverty and government dependence and increases in self-sufficiency.\n\nProhibits the expenditure for abortions, with certain exceptions, of any funds authorized or appropriated by federal law, and funds in any trust fund to which funds are authorized or appropriated by federal law.\n\nProhibits funding for health benefits plans that cover abortion.\n\nProhibits the allowance of any tax credit with respect to amounts paid or incurred for an abortion or with respect to amounts paid or incurred for a health benefits plan (including premium assistance) that includes coverage of abortion."
