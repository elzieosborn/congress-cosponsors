Directs the Administrator to exempt from all requirements of such rule any farm with an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of 10,000 gallons or less and no history of spills.\n\nExcludes from the aggregate storage capacity of a farm all containers on separate parcels that have a capacity of less than 1,320 gallons."
