  <summary date="2012-07-20T19:45:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Juvenile Mentoring Program Reauthorization Act of 2012 or the JUMP Reauthorization Act of 2012 - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to direct the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to award grants to and enter into contracts with&#160;national, regional, and local nonprofit organizations to implement mentoring programs that link at-risk youth with responsible adults to provide general guidance to such youth, promote personal and social responsibility, increase at-risk youth's participation in and enhance their ability to benefit from elementary and secondary education, discourage use of illegal drugs and dangerous weapons and involvement in gangs, and encourage participation in community service and activities. Defines "at-risk youth" as individuals under age 18 who are at risk of educational failure or involvement in delinquent activities.

Requires the Administrator to develop and distribute to program participants specific model guidelines for screening prospective program mentors.

Gives priority to grant applicants that: (1) serve at-risk youth in high crime areas; (2) have at least 60% of their youth eligible to receive funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; (3) establish and support mentoring programs that serve at-risk youth in public housing or on Native American lands; and (4) serve at-risk youth with a parent in the military, including a deployed parent.</summary>
