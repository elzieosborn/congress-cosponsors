Defines \"at-risk youth\" as individuals under age 18 who are at risk of educational failure or involvement in delinquent activities.\n\nRequires the Administrator to develop and distribute to program participants specific model guidelines for screening prospective program mentors.\n\nGives priority to grant applicants that: (1) serve at-risk youth in high crime areas; (2) have at least 60% of their youth eligible to receive funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; (3) establish and support mentoring programs that serve at-risk youth in public housing or on Native American lands; and (4) serve at-risk youth with a parent in the military, including a deployed parent."
