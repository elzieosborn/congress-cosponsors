Limits each grant award to: (1) an amount equal to 50% of the energy-efficiency improvement, and (2) $200,000.\n\n Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY2013-FY2016 and makes offsetting reductions in authorizations for energy sustainability and efficiency grants under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act."
