Urges DOD especially to ensure that DHS can identify DOD equipment and technology that could also be used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to combat illicit trafficking across the international borders between the United States and Mexico and the United States and Canada, including any that could be used to detect and track the illicit use of ultralight aircraft."
