  <summary date="2011-10-31T12:51:14Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Save Our Postal Worker Jobs Act of 2011 - Prescribes the "average pay" to be used in determining annuities for civilian employment with the United States Postal Service (USPS) for purposes of provisions relating to future benefits attributable to such employment in order to calculate the amount of any USPS surplus or supplemental liability under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).

Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM): (1) within six months after enactment of this Act, to determine (or, if applicable, redetermine) the amount of such surplus or liability as of the close of the most recently ending fiscal year using the methodology required under this Act; and (2) if the result is a surplus, to transfer the surplus amount to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund within 15 days after the determination of a surplus.

Provides for an alternate determination of a USPS surplus or supplemental liability for FY2016-FY2020.

Requires transfer of certain surplus postal retirement contributions in FY2011 to the Postal&#160;Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund or the Employees' Compensation Fund under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.

Expresses the intent of Congress that this Act shall apply to allocations of past, present, and future benefit liabilities between the USPS and the Treasury.</summary>
