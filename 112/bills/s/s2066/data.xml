Permits closures or restrictions on such land for purposes including resource conservation, public safety, energy or mineral production, energy generation or transmission infrastructure, water supply facilities, national security, or compliance with other law.

Allows federal agencies to: (1) lease or permit use of federal public land for recreational shooting ranges, and (2) designate such specific land for recreational shooting activities.

Requires annual reports on closures of federal public lands to hunting, recreational fishing, or recreational shooting.

Sets forth requirements for specified closures or significant restrictions involving 640 or more contiguous acres of federal public land or water to hunting or recreational fishing or related activities.
