  <summary date="2011-10-12T15:55:38Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Caring for Camp Lejeune Veterans Act of 2011 - Provides hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for any illness acquired by veterans and family members who were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, while the water there was contaminated by volatile organic compounds, including known human carcinogens and probable human carcinogens. Makes the provision of such care and services for family members dependent on appropriations for such purpose.

Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the cost of such care and services.

Requires the DOD Secretary to merge and consolidate all commissary and exchange stores into a single system that, by no later than the end of FY2015, operates on a self-sufficient basis without the need for financial support through appropriated funds. Prohibits any DOD funds from being obligated or expended after FY2015 for commissary and exchange stores.</summary>
