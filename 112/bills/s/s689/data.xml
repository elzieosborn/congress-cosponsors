Declares it is the goal of the United States to reduce oil consumption by 2030 by an amount equal to or greater than the quantity of oil imported from outside of North America.

Directs the President, in coordination with the National Energy Security Council (established by this Act) and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to develop a national oil independence plan, which shall be updated biennially.

Directs the President to review existing federal programs and authorities (including tax policies) to determine: (1) which of them could be used to accelerate reductions in oil dependence, and (2) the means to maximize such reductions.
