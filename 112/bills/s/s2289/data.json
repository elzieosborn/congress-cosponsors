Applies such provisions only to completed pediatric studies that are the subject of a written request by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nRequires the Secretary to issue internal standard operating procedures that provide for review by the Pediatric Review Committee of any significant modifications to pediatric study plans or written requests by the Secretary for pediatric studies.\n\nDirects the Secretary to make publicly available the medical, statistical, and clinical pharmacology reviews of pediatric studies submitted between January 4, 2002, and September 7, 2007, for which six months of market exclusivity was granted and that resulted in a labeling change.\n\nEstablishes a process under which the Secretary may grant an extension to a new drug applicant to defer submission of an assessment of a drug's safety and effectiveness in pediatric populations.\n\n Sets forth enforcement provisions if a persons fails to submit a required assessment, meet requirements for a deferral, or submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.\n\nEstablishes a procedure for the Secretary and applicant to agree on a pediatric study plan prior to submission of an assessment.\n\nMakes the Pediatric Advisory Committee a permanent committee. Extends the Pediatric Subcommittee of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for the duration of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee.\n\nExtends for five years the program for humanitarian exemptions for pediatric medical devices.\n\nReauthorizes through FY2017 a demonstration program to promote pediatric device development.\n\nReauthorizes a National Institutes of Health (NIH) program of research on pediatric therapeutics.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General (GAO) to evaluate the effectiveness of current federal programs in ensuring that medicines used by children are tested in pediatric populations and properly labeled for use in children."
