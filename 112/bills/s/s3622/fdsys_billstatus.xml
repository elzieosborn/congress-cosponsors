        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Protecting Patients and Hospitals From Price Gouging Act - Authorizes the President to issue an executive order declaring a market shortage for six months with regard to one or more vital drugs if the total supply of all clinically interchangeable versions of a drug regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is inadequate to meet the current or projected demand at the user level.</p> <p>Defines a &quot;vital drug&quot; as any drug or biologic used to prevent or treat a serious or life-threatening disease or medical condition, for which there is no other available source with sufficient supply available.</p> <p>Makes it unlawful, when the President issues such an executive order, for any person to sell vital drugs at a price that: (1) is unreasonably excessive, and (2) indicates that the seller is taking unfair advantage of the circumstances related to a market shortage to increase prices unreasonably during that period.</p> <p>Gives the Attorney General authority to enforce penalties under this Act. </p> <p>Makes any person who sells, or offers to sell, any vital drug during a declared market shortage with the knowledge and intent to charge a price unreasonably excessive under the circumstances guilty of an offense and subject to injunction and penalties. Applies such sanctions, except to a hospital or a physician, in the geographical area where the vital drug market shortage has been declared and to all wholesalers and distributors in the chain of distribution.</p> <p>Sets forth factors for the Attorney General to consider in determining whether an alleged violator's price was unreasonably excessive.</p> <p>Makes a declaration under this Act terminate if: (1) there is enacted a law terminating the market shortage after a national market shortage is declared, or (2) the President issues a proclamation terminating the declaration. Authorizes the President to renew such a market shortage declaration if the severe shortage continues to affect the health and well-being of citizens beyond the initial six-month period.</p>]]></text>
