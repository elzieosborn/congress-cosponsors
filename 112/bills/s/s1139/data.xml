  <summary date="2011-06-15T21:16:21Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Servicemember Student Loan Interest Relief Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty in hostile areas to benefit from the provision barring the accrual of interest on their student loans under the Federal Direct Loan program regardless of the date their loan was first disbursed. (Currently, their loan must be disbursed on or after October 1, 2008, to qualify for such treatment.)

Eliminates the restriction of such benefit on direct consolidation loans to that portion of the loan which is used to repay direct loans.</summary>
