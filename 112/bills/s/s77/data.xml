  <summary date="2011-02-17T20:01:35Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Pollution and Costs Reduction Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a Building Pollution Reduction Program to provide assistance to building owners to reduce the emission of air pollutants and building operating costs by constructing highly efficient buildings and increasing the efficiency of, and reducing the emissions associated with, existing buildings.

Requires the Administrator to: (1) provide such assistance to building owners based on the extent to which projects relating to the buildings of the owners result in verifiable, additional, and enforceable reductions in emissions of air pollutants through operational improvements such as improved energy efficiency, increased water-use efficiency, and use of renewable energy sources; and (2) give priority to projects that achieve minimum scores in energy performance evaluations and result in measurable pollution reduction benefits not encompassed within the metrics of the Energy Star program.</summary>
