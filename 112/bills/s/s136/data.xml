  <summary date="2013-09-18T22:07:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ban Poisonous Additives Act of 2011 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem to be adulterated: (1) food intended for children three years of age or younger if the container is composed of bisphenol A (BPA); (2) a baby bottle or cup that is intended for use by children three years of age or younger, that does not contain a food when such bottle or cup is sold or distributed at retail, and that is composed of BPA; and (3) infant formula if the container (excluding packaging on the outside of a container that does not come into contact with infant formula powder) is composed of BPA.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) issue a revised safety assessment for food containers composed of BPA, taking into consideration different types of such containers and the use of such containers with respect to different foods; and (2) determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to BPA through food containers or other items composed of BPA, taking into consideration potential adverse effects from low-dose exposure and the effects of exposure on vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly, and populations with high exposure to BPA.</summary>
