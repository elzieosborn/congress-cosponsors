Directs the Secretary to determine the populations that are considered at high risk.\n\nRequires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to complete the revision of CDC guidelines for screening individuals with HCV, taking into account: (1) the effectiveness issues that have been raised with respect to the current CDC guidelines for screening, (2) the importance of responding to the perception that receiving such screening may be stigmatizing, and (3) whether age-based screening would be effective.\n\nRequires the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to: (1) develop HCV screening recommendations, taking into account the guidelines established by CDC and new and improved treatments for HCV; and (2) develop HBV screening recommendations, taking into account the guidelines the CDC recommended in 2008."
