Requires the Clearinghouse to establish an Internet directory of information regarding LTC insurance (\"to be known as LTC Insurance Compare).\n\nAmends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require a state Medicaid plan to provide for the annual submission of data relating to functional criteria for the receipt of nursing facility services under the plan.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to apply Medicaid partnership required model provisions to all tax-qualified LTC insurance contracts.\n\nOutlines a process for secretarial review of model provisions adopted by NAIC with respect to their application to tax-qualified LTC policies and Medicaid partnership policies to determine if updating such provisions would improve consumer protections for insured individuals.\n\nApplies 2006 NAIC model regulations to Medicaid partnerships. (Currently, 2000 NAIC model regulations apply). Sets forth additional requirements applicable to such policies."
