Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act of 2012 - Directs the Secretary of State to conduct a review every four years of U.S. diplomacy and development for the next four-year period (quadrennial diplomacy and development review) which shall include: (1) recommendations regarding the long-term diplomacy and development policy and strategic framework of the United States; (2) U.S. diplomatic priorities; and (3) guidance on the related programs, assets, capabilities, budget, policies, and authorities of the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

Provides for interagency consultations in the conduct of the diplomacy and development review.

 Requires each diplomacy and development review to: (1) delineate the U.S. national diplomacy and development policy and strategic framework; (2) prioritize critical national diplomacy and development areas, capabilities, and resources; (3) describe interagency cooperation and preparedness of relevant federal assets; (4) describe the roles of international organizations and multilateral institutions in advancing U.S. diplomatic and development objectives; (5) identify the necessary budget plan; and (6) assess the organizational alignment and management mechanisms of the Department and USAID with the national diplomacy and development policy and strategic framework.

Authorizes the Secretary to establish within the Department an Office of Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.
