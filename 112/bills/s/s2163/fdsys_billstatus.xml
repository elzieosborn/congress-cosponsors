        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Kidney Disease Equitable Access, Prevention, and Research Act of 2012 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), in specified circumstances, to accept the results of a state licensure survey for purposes of determining federal certification of the compliance of a renal dialysis facility (RDF) with the conditions of Medicare participation.</p> <p>Allows the Secretary to assess and collect reasonable fees for the initial Medicare survey from an RDF<b>.</b></p> <p>Revises Medicare requirements for group health plans to extend from 12 to 42 months after an individual becomes eligible for Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled) benefits the period during which a group health plan is a primary payer (and Medicare the secondary payer) for ESRD patients. <p>Requires such a plan to: (1) provide adequate, advanced, written notice to patients regarding changes to dialysis service benefits, new restrictions on out-of-network access, or reductions in rates paid for out-of-network benefits; (2) allow patients to continue using their existing provider or facility for dialysis services for at least 24 months after a plan or issuer notice of any change; (3) hold patients harmless from a provider network change if the change requires unreasonable drive time or disrupts the physician-patient relationship; (4) ensure that out-of-pocket payments for such services apply to the Medicare part C (Medicare+Choice Program) out-of-pocket maximums and are treated as non-routine for copayment purposes; and (5) meet minimum network adequacy standards. <p>Prohibits such a plan from: (1) restricting the duration or number of dialysis sessions for patients to less than the number for which payment may be made; (2) requiring assignment of benefits for such services; or (3) denying or limiting coverage for patients for such services if premiums, copayments, or other payments are made by third parties on their behalf. <p>Directs the Secretary to study: (1) the social, behavioral, and biological factors leading to kidney disease; and (2) efforts to slow the progression of kidney disease in minority populations that are disproportionately affected by it. <p>Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the research gaps with respect to the development of quality metrics and care management metrics for ESRD patients. <p>Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate the transportation barriers facing dialysis patients that result in less than 100% compliance with their plan of care under the Medicare program. <p>Includes as a person qualified to furnish kidney disease education services an RDF with a physician or a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist. <p>Declares that the mandatory single payment to an RDF or other provider of renal dialysis services shall not take into account the amount of payment for kidney disease education services. <p>Revises the definition of<b> &ldquo;</b>kidney disease education services&rdquo; to specify education services furnished to individuals: (1) with stage V (as well as those with stage IV) chronic kidney disease, and (2) who are not receiving dialysis services.]]></text>
