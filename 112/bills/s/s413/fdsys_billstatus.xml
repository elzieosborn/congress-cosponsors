Requires each agency with an Inspector General appointed under the Inspector General Act of 1978 to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the information security program and evaluations. Requires the assessments to be performed in accordance with standards developed by the Government Accountability Office, in collaboration with the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, with assistance from the Taskforce. Provides for the delegation of the Director's authorities to the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under specified circumstances where unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information would have a debilitating impact on the missions of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the CIA.</p> <p>Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the NCCC Director to assess the readiness and capacity of the federal workforce to meet the needs of the cybersecurity mission of the federal government.
