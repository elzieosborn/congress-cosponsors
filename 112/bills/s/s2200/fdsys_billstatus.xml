        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Saving the Family Farm Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the gross estate of a decedent the adjusted value of any qualified family-owned farm or business (i.e., a qualified farmland or a qualified trade or business) included in the estate. Requires: (1) the decedent to have been a citizen or resident of the United States at the time of death, (2) the decedent and members of the decedent's family to have owned not less than 60% of such farm or business in any 5-year period during the 8-year period prior to the decedent's death, and (3) material participation in the operation of the farm or business by the decedent and members of the decedent's family. </p> <p>Defines &quot;qualified farmland&quot; as any real property located in the United States that is used as a farm for farming purposes. Defines &quot;qualified trade or business&quot; as any interest in a trade or business that is not an interest in a C corporation and that was acquired from or passed from the decedent to an heir. </p> <p>Imposes a recapture tax on an heir who disposes of any interest in a qualified family-owned farm or business or who ceases to use qualified farmland for farming purposes after inheriting such property. </p>]]></text>
