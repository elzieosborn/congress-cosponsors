(Mobility management activities are designed to improve coordination among public and other transportation service providers.)\n\nRequires the National Transit Database to include information on the public transportation formula grant program for older individuals and the disabled, and the public transportation formula grant program for nonurban areas.\n\nRequires metropolitan planning organizations and states to involve older individuals and the disabled in metropolitan and statewide transportation planning.\n\nDirects the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to enter into a cooperative agreement with the National Center on Senior Transportation to: (1) provide technical assistance to transit and human services organizations, (2) disseminate best practices regarding transportation for older individuals, and (3) make grants to nonprofit organizations to test innovative and replicable approaches for addressing the mobility needs of older individuals.\n\nRequires the FTA to make grants to nonprofit aging services organizations to offer mobility management services, and develop and implement enhanced technology to support those services."
