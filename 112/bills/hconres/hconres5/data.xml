  <summary date="2011-01-07T19:30:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Reaffirms to the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel the importance of Jerusalem's reunification.

Expresses the belief that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected, and reaffirms Israel's right to take necessary steps to prevent Jerusalem's future division.

Calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to affirm as a matter of U.S. policy that Jerusalem must remain Israel's undivided capital.

Urges: (1) the President to implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 and begin the process of relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; and (2) U.S. officials to refrain from any actions that contradict U.S. law on this subject.</summary>
