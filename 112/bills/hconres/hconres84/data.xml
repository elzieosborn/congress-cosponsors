Encourages the use of gender-sensitive frameworks in developing climate change policies.

Affirms Congress's commitment to: (1) support women who are particularly vulnerable to prepare for and adapt to climate change impacts; (2) empower women in the planning, design, implementation, and evaluation of climate change strategies; and (3) include women in economic development planning, policies, and practices that directly improve conditions that result from climate change.

Encourages the President to: (1) integrate a gender approach in all U.S. policies and programs that are globally related to climate change; and (2) ensure that those policies and programs support women globally to prepare for and adapt to climate change.</summary>
