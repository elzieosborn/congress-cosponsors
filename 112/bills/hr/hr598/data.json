Makes members of socially and economically disadvantaged ANCs or ANVs eligible for such loans.\n\nDirects the Administrator to apply to small businesses owned by an ANC or ANV the competitive thresholds for awarding SBA sole source contracts that are applicable to small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\n\nProhibits the Administrator from extending or waiving, for small businesses owned by an ANC or ANV, the time limitations applicable to participants in the small business capital ownership development program. Outlines annual report requirements for program participants who are ANCs or ANVs.\n\nRequires the Administrator to amend SBA regulations to incorporate amendments made by this Act."
