  <summary date="2011-10-27T16:12:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Furloughed FAA Employees Compensation Act of 2011 - Requires federal employees furloughed as a result of the lapse in expenditure authority from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund after 11:59 p.m. on July 22, 2011, through August 5, 2011, to be compensated for such lapse at their standard rates of compensation.

Ratifies and approves all actions taken by federal employees, contractors, and grantees to maintain the essential level of government operations, services, and activities to protect life and property and to bring about orderly termination of government functions during such lapse, if otherwise in accord with the provisions of the Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2011, Part IV.

Requires funds used by the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to compensate such employees to be: (1) derived from funds previously authorized out of the Airport and Airway Fund and made available or limited to DOT by the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011; and (2) subject to the obligation limitations established in such Act.</summary>
