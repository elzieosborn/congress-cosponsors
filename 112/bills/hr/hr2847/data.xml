Requires an employer or employer association to file an H-2C petition with the Department of Agriculture (USDA) which shall include specified employment-related attestations.

Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) penalties; (2) working conditions, wages, and transportation reimbursement; (3) admissions and extensions of stay; (4) abandonment of employment and worker replacement; (5) legal assistance; and (6) arbitration and mediation.

Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct investigations and random audits of employer work sites.

Requires an employer to guarantee to offer the worker employment for the hourly equivalent of at least 50% of the work hours during the total anticipated period of employment.

Limits the number of annual fiscal year H-2C admissions. Prohibits the admission of spouses and children of H-2C workers.

Extends coverage under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act to H-2C workers.

Makes the provisions of this Act effective two years after its enactment. Terminates authority to petition for H-2A temporary agricultural workers two years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
