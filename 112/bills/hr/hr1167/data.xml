  <summary date="2011-12-06T18:03:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Welfare Reform Act of 2011 - Welfare Reform Restoration Act - Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act to revise the TANF program by: (1) eliminating the temporary modification of the caseload reduction credit, and (2) reducing funding of state family assistance grants.

Amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to: (1) restore its former name, the Food Stamp Act of 1977, and restore its text as if the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 had not been enacted; (2) rename supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits as the food stamp program; (3) revise work requirements for the food stamp program; and (4) require able-bodied work eligible adult members of a family unit to participate in a work activation program during a full month of participation in the food stamp program, fulfilling specified levels of work activity during that month. (Work activation means, not employment, but supervised job search, community service activities, education and job training, workfare, or drug and alcohol treatment.)

Specifies a financial reward for any state that reduces its food stamp caseload below calendar 2006 levels.

Requires the President to include means-tested welfare spending in every budget submission.

Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to define and establish an aggregate cap for means-tested welfare spending.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide grants to states to reward reductions in poverty and government dependence and increases in self-sufficiency.

Prohibits the expenditure for abortions, with certain exceptions, of any funds authorized or appropriated by federal law, and funds in any trust fund to which funds are authorized or appropriated by federal law.

Prohibits funding for health benefits plans that cover abortion.

Prohibits the allowance of any tax credit with respect to amounts paid or incurred for an abortion or with respect to amounts paid or incurred for a health benefits plan (including premium assistance) that includes coverage of abortion.</summary>
