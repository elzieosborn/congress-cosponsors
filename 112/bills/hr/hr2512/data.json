Requires the Henderson Redevelopment Agency to reimburse the Secretary for appraisal costs.\n\nDirects the Secretary to prepare a reasonable approximate estimation of the costs to assess, remediate, and reclaim the Three Kids Mine Project Site (the Three Kids Mine Federal Land and the adjacent approximately 314 acres of non-federal land, together comprising approximately 1,262 acres, as depicted on the map entitled \"Three Kids Mine Project Area\").\n\n Requires the Henderson Redevelopment Agency to pay the fair market value, if any for the Three Kids Mine Federal Land.\n\nRequires the Mine Remediation and Reclamation Agreement to be an enforceable consent order or agreement administered by the state.\n\nRequires the Henderson Redevelopment Agency to notify the Secretary in writing that is prepared to accept conveyance of the Three Kids Mine Federal Land.\n\n(Sec. 4) Withdraws the Three Kids Mine Federal Land, for a 10-year period, following enactment, or on the date of conveyance, from: (1) entry, appropriation, operation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and the geothermal leasing laws.\n\n Relinquishes and revokes, subject to valid existing rights, any withdrawal of public land for reclamation project purposes that includes all or any portion of the Three Kids Mine Federal Land for which the Bureau of Reclamation has determined that it has no further need to the extent necessary to exclude from the withdrawal the land no longer needed and to allow for the immediate conveyance of the Three Kids Mine Federal Land.\n\nProhibits anything in this Act from diminishing, hindering, or interfering with the exclusive and perpetual use by existing rights holders of the operation, maintenance, and improvement of water conveyance infrastructure and facilities situated on the Three Kids Mine Federal Land that were constructed or permitted by the Bureau of Reclamation prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\n(Sec. 5) Adjusts the boundary of the River Mountains Area of Critical Environmental Concern.\n\n(Sec. 6) Releases the United States, upon making the conveyance, from any and all liabilities or claims of any kind or nature arising from the presence, release, or threat of release of any hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, petroleum product, solid waste, or mining related materials at the Three Kids Mine Project Site.\n\n(Sec. 7) Makes the provisions of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 non-applicable to land conveyed under this Act."
