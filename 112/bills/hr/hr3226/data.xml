  <summary date="2011-11-10T16:18:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends title IV (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of the Social Security Act to reestablish for FY2012-FY2013 the Emergency Contingency Fund for State Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Programs for the purpose of grants to states by the Secretary of the Treasury related to: (1) increases in TANF caseloads, (2) increased expenditures for non-recurrent short term benefits, and (3) increased expenditures for subsidized employment. Modifies for FY2011-FY2012 the formula for the pro rata reduction credit in the calculation of the minimum participation rate of all families of a state receiving TANF assistance for any reduction in such rate owing to caseload reductions not required by federal law and not resulting from changes in state eligibility criteria.</summary>
