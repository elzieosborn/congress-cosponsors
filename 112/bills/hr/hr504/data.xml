  <summary date="2011-02-10T16:42:58Z" status="Introduced in House">First Responders Fighting Terrorism Protection Act of 2011 - Grants qualified immunity from civil liability for a first responder who: (1) takes reasonable action to prevent an act of terrorism; or (2) observes or receives a report of, and takes reasonable action to respond to, any suspicious transaction, activity, or occurrence that indicates that an individual may be engaging, or preparing to engage, in a violation of law relating to a terrorist act. Makes a first responder not entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity nevertheless immune from civil liability under federal, state, and local law if such responder acted in good faith and on objectively reasonable suspicion.

Entitles a first responder found to be immune from liability under this Act to recover from the plaintiff all reasonable costs and attorney fees.</summary>
