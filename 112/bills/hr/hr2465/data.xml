Allows additional FECA benefits, up to $50,000, for workers who sustain an injury that results in a serious disfigurement of the face, head, or neck.

Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to require, as a condition of receiving compensation under FECA, a claimant to consent to the release by the Social Security Administration (SSA) of such claimant's social security earnings information.

Provides for the continuation of pay, for up to 135 days, of an employee who has filed a claim for wage loss due to a traumatic injury in a zone of armed conflict. Requires a claim for wage loss to be filed not later than 45 days following termination of assignment to the zone of armed conflict or return to the United States, whichever occurs later. Grants a right of subrogation to the United States for the continuation of pay of a federal employee.

Allows payment of up to $6,000 of funeral and burial expenses for deaths of federal employees that result from an injury sustained in the performance of duty.
