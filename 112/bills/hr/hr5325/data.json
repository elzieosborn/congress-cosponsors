The instructions contained in the motion seek to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to ensure readiness and response (including advance measures, the provision of potable water, and the repair of flood and storm damage reduction projects) for floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters by increasing funds for the Corps of Engineers Flood Control and Coast Emergencies account by $31,600,000, and decrease the Corps of Engineers administrative account by the same amount. The Motion would also strengthen U.S. energy ties with Israel by increasing funds for U.S.-Israeli non-military energy cooperation by $1 million, and decrease the Department of Energy's administrative account by the same amount.",
