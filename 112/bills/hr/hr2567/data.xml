  <summary date="2011-11-01T22:40:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal First Offender Improvement Act of 2011 - Amends the federal criminal code to extend the pre-judgment probation and expungement procedures for simple possession of a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act to individuals who are convicted under such Act of drug trafficking or of attempting or conspiring to commit a drug offense.

Sets forth requirements for granting pre-judgment probation for drug trafficking or of attempting or conspiring to commit a drug offense, including that: (1) the offender did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) while committing the offense; (2) the offense did not result in death or serious injury to any person; (3) the offender was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; and (4) the offender has not been previously convicted of a crime of violence or other offense punishable by a prison term of more than one year. Provides for a period of such probation of up to two years. Revises the requirement for pre-judgment probation for simple possession to having not been previously convicted of a crime of violence or other offense punishable by a term of imprisonment for more than one year.

Eliminates the requirement that an offender seeking expungement of a record of a disposition be less than 21 years old at the time of the offense.</summary>
