(Current law requires only periodic testing and evaluation.)</p> <p>Defines &quot;information system&quot; as a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.

Requires the capability, where practicable, to be continuous and technically automated.</p> <p>(Sec. 4) Specifies that no additional funds are authorized for agencies to carry out their responsibilities under this Act.
