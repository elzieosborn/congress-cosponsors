  <summary date="2011-12-14T22:59:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Revises the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) program which guarantees veterans' loans for the purchase of residential cooperative housing to remove a provision which limits to five years after a loan is guaranteed the use of loan proceeds to purchase stock or membership in a cooperative housing corporation. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that a loan used for such purchase in a corporation that has been reviewed and approved by a lender approved by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) is not denied.

Authorizes the Secretary to advertise the availability of such loan guarantees.</summary>
