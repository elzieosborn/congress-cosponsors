  <summary date="2012-10-31T14:47:40Z" status="Passed House amended">Federal Law Enforcement Personnel and Resources Allocation Improvement Act of 2012 - Directs the Attorney General, in allocating federal law enforcement personnel and resources, to give priority to placing and retaining those personnel and resources in states and local jurisdictions that have a high incidence of homicide or other violent crime, based on federal records of crime, including the National Uniform Crime Reports, or on the best and most current information otherwise available to the Attorney General.

Requires the Attorney General to designate an existing official within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to: (1) develop practices and procedures to carry out such requirement, and (2) monitor compliance with those practices and procedures by DOJ.

Directs the Attorney General to report annually on the implementation of such requirement. Requires such report to: (1) specify which states and local jurisdictions have a high incidence of homicide or other violent crime; (2) identify the specific steps taken by the Attorney General to implement such requirement with respect to each of those states and local jurisdictions; and (3) provide a description of the methodology used to determine the total number of authorized federal law enforcement positions, to allocate those authorized positions among states and local jurisdictions, and to assign personnel to fill those positions.</summary>
