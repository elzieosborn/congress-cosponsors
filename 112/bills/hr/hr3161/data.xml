  <summary date="2012-01-27T21:22:30Z" status="Introduced in House">Ovarian and Cervical Cancer Awareness Act of 2011 - Amends provisions of the Public Health Service Act commonly referred to as Johanna's Law to revise requirements for a national public awareness campaign regarding gynecologic cancers to: (1) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase awareness and knowledge of ovarian and cervical cancers, and (2) expand such campaign to include public service announcements targeted to low-income women.

Expresses the sense of Congress that funding by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of gynecologic cancer education and awareness efforts should reflect the fact that ovarian and cervical cancers are the most deadly of the gynecologic cancers.</summary>
