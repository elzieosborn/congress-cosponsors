  <summary date="2011-10-14T22:22:03Z" status="Introduced in House">National Youth Summer Jobs Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Labor to award 5-year competitive grants to eligible local government units to provide summer employment, including job readiness activities, work experiences, and job placement, for out-of-school youths age 14 to 21 who are enrolled in a public or private secondary school or have received a secondary school diploma or its equivalent but are basic-skills deficient, unemployed, or underemployed.

Allows eligible entities that operate existing youth summer jobs programs to use grants to expand their programs, in lieu of establishing new job placement programs, by providing job training and support services, including health and nutrition referral, housing referral, financial literacy, and instruction on basic daily living skills.</summary>
