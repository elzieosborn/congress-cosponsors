The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to the admission of nonimmigrant nurses (H-1C visa) in health professional shortage areas to: (1) permit a one-time three-year extension of admission, and (2) reduce the maximum number of such visas per fiscal year to 300.\n\nAuthorizes such nonimmigrant alien to accept new employment as a registered nurse at any facility which qualifies for the H-1C program upon a prospective employer's filing of a new petition.\n\nContinues employment authorization until adjudication of a new petition. Terminates such authorization if a petition is denied.\n\nRequires such nonimmigrant alien: (1) to have been lawfully admitted to the United States; (2) to have not been employed without authorization since admission; and (3) to have had a prospective employer file a petition for new employment before the date of expiration of the authorized period of stay, except that if the alien is terminated or laid off by his or her employer such new employment petition shall be filed during the ensuing 45-day period."
