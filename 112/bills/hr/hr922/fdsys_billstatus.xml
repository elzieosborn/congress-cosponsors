    <constitutionalAuthorityStatementText><![CDATA[<pre>[Pages H1576-H1577]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [<a href='http://www.gpo.gov'>www.gpo.gov</a>]By Mr. GOSAR:H.R. 922.Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuantto the following:It was explained by James Madison, in Federalist No. 45,that the ``powers delegated to Congress in the proposedconstitution to the federal government are few and defined.''Mindful of this admonition, this proposed bill comports withseveral enumerated powers granted to Congress. Congress hasthe power to enact this legislation pursuant to thefollowing: Article I, Section 8, Clause 17: The Congressshall have the power ``[t]o exercise exclusive Legislation inall Cases whatsoever, . . . to exercise like Authority[[Page H1577]]over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislatureof the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection ofForts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needfulBuildings.'' Thus, lands purchased and held by the FederalGovernment, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of theFederal Government for purposes of management, control,disposition and if necessary, resolution of issues arisingout of such land use. That being said, nothing herein shallbe deemed an expansion of, or resolution of, the federalgovernment's power to purchase and then hold landindefinitely and in substantial percentages as known in theWestern States if not ``needful'' for federal purposes.Further, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Collins v. YosemitePark & Curry Co., 304 U.S. 518, 529 (U.S. 1938), reasonedthat Clause 17 ``is not the sole authority'' for eitherproperty acquisition or management, as ``[i]t has never beennecessary heretofore for this Court to determine whether ornot the United States has the constitutional right toexercise jurisdiction over territory, within the geographicallimits of a State, acquired for purposes other than thosespecified in Clause 17.''Further, the Constitution's Property Clause, Article IV,Sec. 3, Clause 2, provides that ``Congress shall have thepower to dispose of and make all needful Rules andRegulations respecting the Territory or other Propertybelonging to the United States.'' This Management Clause ascurrently understood conveys the express authority toCongress to address issues and resolve matters involvingFederal Land. Additionally, Article I, Section 8, Clause 18,further provides a constitutional basis for this Act as itconveys the power to Congress to implement its enumeratedpowers (but this clause cannot expand those powers) and``make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper'' forexecuting and implementing enumerated powers.</pre>]]></constitutionalAuthorityStatementText>

        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Burn Area Flood Prevention Act of 2011 - Amends the Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act of 2009 to include within the purpose of FLAME Wildlife Suppression Reserve Funds to cover the costs of burn area responses, including flood prevention. Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to make the waiting period for coverage under a new contract for flood insurance coverage, and any modification to coverage under an existing flood insurance contract, inapplicable to the initial purchase of flood insurance coverage upon a determination by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that such period should be waived for private property affected by flooding on federal land affected by wildfire.</p> <p>Establishes the Schultz Fire Flooding Area Task Force. Designates the FEMA Administrator as the Chair of the Task Force. Directs the Task Force to: (1) coordinate the efforts of the entities represented on the Task Force (including FEMA, the Corps of Engineers, the Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the United States Geological Survey [USGS], state and local governments, and community-based organizations and other interested parties) to immediately implement interim flood protection systems, including the retention of water retention basins; (2) identify existing and potential funding, technical assistance, general investigations, and construction of short-term flood protection projects; and (3) carry out a detailed study of the affected area to evaluate the potential of integrating projects and programs of the Corps of Engineers, FEMA, and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) into a comprehensive, long-term flood protection system for the affected area. </p> <p>Directs the Attorney General to report on court costs and legal fees and expenses awarded in connection with the Jack Smith/Schultz Fuels Reduction Healthy Forest Restoration Project.</p>]]></text>
