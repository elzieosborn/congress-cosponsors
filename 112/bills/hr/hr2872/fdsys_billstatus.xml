        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Job Creation and Urban Revitalization Act of 2011 - Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to expand the new markets venture capital program (currently, a program under which venture capital companies provide equity capital investments and operational assistance to small businesses in low-income geographic areas) to areas of high unemployment. Allows the operational assistance that companies provide to small businesses in such high-unemployment areas to include retooling, updating, or replacing of machinery or equipment.</p> <p>Makes the Small Business Administration (SBA) definition of &quot;low-income geographic area&quot; under the program the same as the definition of &quot;low-income community&quot; under the Internal Revenue Code, except that, without regard to such meaning, the term shall include an area of high unemployment. </p> <p>Requires the SBA Administrator, in conditionally approving companies to participate in the program, to select at least one company from each SBA geographic region.</p> <p>Directs the Administrator to allow conditionally-approved companies two years (currently, a period of time not to exceed two years) to satisfy capital and other requirements for final approval.</p> <p>Exempts from a requirement that conditionally-approved companies have certain binding capital commitments in order to provide operational assistance, companies primarily serving small businesses in areas of: (1) high unemployment, or (2) urban manufacturing revitalization.</p> <p>Authorizes the Administrator to approve a company to serve, throughout all states, solely small businesses in urban manufacturing revitalization areas. </p> <p>Reduces to $3 million the minimum capital requirements for final approval of conditionally-approved companies engaged primarily in development of and investment in small businesses located in areas of high unemployment. Reduces to $2 million such capital requirements for conditionally-approved companies so engaged primarily with small businesses in urban manufacturing revitalization areas. (Current law would otherwise require any conditionally-approved company to raise at least $5 million.)</p> <p>Revises the formula for operational assistance grants.</p> <p>Authorizes such grants to conditionally-approved companies (up to $50,000 per company), provided that repayment is made if such companies do not receive final approval.</p>]]></text>
