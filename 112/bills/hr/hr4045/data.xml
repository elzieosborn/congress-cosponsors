  <summary date="2012-06-25T15:02:00Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on May 15, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to determine that the changes made to the program guidance relating to the award of Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence administrative absence days or other authorized benefits described herein to members and former members of the reserves under a specified Department of Defense (DOD) instruction shall not apply to current or former reservists whose qualified mobilization commenced before October 1, 2011, and continued until the termination of the mobilization. Includes within such authorized benefits: (1) the payment of up to $200 per day for each day the individual would have qualified for a day of administrative absence had the above changes not applied to the individual, in the case of a former member of the Armed Forces; (2) either one day of administrative absence or up to $200 per day as described above, in the case of a member on active duty at the time of the provision of benefits; and (3) either one day of administrative absence to be retained for future use or up to $200 per day as described above, in the case of a member serving in the Selected Reserve, Inactive National Guard, or Individual Ready Reserve at the time of the provision of benefits. Excludes such additional benefits for former members discharged or released under other than honorable conditions.

Terminates the benefit authority under this Act on October 1, 2014.

Directs the Secretary to transfer specified funds from the Pentagon Reservation Maintenance Revolving Fund as a funding offset for such benefits.</summary>
