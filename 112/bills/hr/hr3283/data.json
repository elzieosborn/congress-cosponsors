Prohibits registered security-based swap dealers from conducting any activities designed to evade any provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 enacted by WSTAA.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this section shall: (1) exempt a transaction from specified restrictions on member bank transactions with affiliates under the Federal Reserve Act or implementing regulations; or (2) affect the authorities of the prudential regulators over certain kinds of swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, or major security-based swap participants under the Commodity Excgange Act as such authorites are established in law other than under WSTAA"
