  <summary date="2012-06-21T16:10:45Z" status="Introduced in House">John Hope Franklin Tulsa-Greenwood Race Riot Claims Accountability Act of 2012 - Declares that any person (including the state of Oklahoma) who, in connection with the Greenwood community of Tulsa, Oklahoma, race riot of 1921 and its aftermath, acted under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the state of Oklahoma to subject, or cause to be subjected, any person to the deprivation, on account of race, of any right secured at the time of the deprivation by Oklahoma law, shall be liable to the party injured in a civil action for redress (thereby allowing claims for damages notwithstanding the federal court decision in Alexander v. State of Oklahoma, which found that such claims were time-barred and not to be determined on the merits).

Prohibits the commencement of such a civil action more than five years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
