Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, regardless of state licensure requirements governing the major disaster area.\n\nRequires an adjuster to: (1) hold a valid license in his or her home state, and (2) have passed any multi-state examination established and administered by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).\n\nUrges NAIC to: (1) adopt a certain model independent claims adjuster licensing Act, and (2) develop and administer a multi-state examination for an independent claims adjuster seeking to adjust claims in a jurisdiction other than his or her home state.\n\nSets forth criteria for state compliance with this Act, including reciprocity.\n\nAuthorizes any independent claims adjuster meeting the requirements of this Act to ascertain, determine, negotiate, or settle a claim in a state that is not in compliance with this Act. Prohibits such a state from imposing additional requirements upon such an adjuster."
