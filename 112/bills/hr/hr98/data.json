Requires the EED to include data on the citizenship status and work and residency eligibility of noncitizens authorized to work in the United States.\n\nRestricts access to EED information.\n\nProhibits individuals from commencing employment with a U.S. employer absent a Social Security card that meets the requirements of this Act and presentation of such card to the employer.\n\nProhibits employers from hiring individuals absent verification of identity and work authorization.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to: (1) assess penalties against employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers or fail to comply with verification procedures; and (2) bring civil actions against those who fail to pay assessments or otherwise violate this Act. Establishes criminal penalties for such violations.\n\nRequires integration of Border Patrol and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint databases.\n\nProhibits this Act from being construed to establish a national identification card."
