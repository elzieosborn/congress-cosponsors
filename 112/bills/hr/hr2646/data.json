Requires further, in the case of a proposed new or replacement facility, a detailed: (1) report of the consideration given to acquiring an existing facility by lease or purchase and to the sharing of health-care resources with the Department of Defense (DOD); and (2) total cost estimate and a cost-benefit comparison for each considered alternative to construction of the facility and an explanation of why the preferred alternative is the most effective means to achieve the stated project goals.\n\nDesignates the VA telehealth clinic in Craig, Colorado, as the \"Major William Edward Adams Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic.\"\n\nExtends to December 31, 2018, specified authority for: (1) treatment, rehabilitation, and additional services for seriously mentally ill and homeless veterans; (2) housing assistance for homeless veterans; (3) the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans; and (4) transfers of real property under the Secretary's jurisdiction or control.
