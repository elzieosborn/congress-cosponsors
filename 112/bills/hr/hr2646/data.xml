  <summary date="2011-11-08T18:20:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans Health Care Facilities Capital Improvement Act of 2011 - Authorizes, within specified amounts, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out certain FY2012 major medical facility: (1) construction projects at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers in Seattle, Washington and West Los Angeles, California; and (2) leases at various outpatient and community-based outpatient clinics. Modifies authorizations for certain previously authorized construction projects in Fayetteville, Arkansas, the Orlando, Florida area, Palo Alto, California, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Louis, Missouri.

Directs the Secretary to include in the prospectus required to be submitted to Congress with a request for funding of a major medical facility project or lease: (1) a detailed estimate of the total costs of the medical facility including the number of personnel and itemized costs for construction, activation, special purpose alteration, ancillary services, and equipment; and (2) data concerning demographics, workload, utilization, and operating costs over a 5-, 10-, and 20-year period. Requires further, in the case of a proposed new or replacement facility, a detailed: (1) report of the consideration given to acquiring an existing facility by lease or purchase and to the sharing of health-care resources with the Department of Defense (DOD); and (2) total cost estimate and a cost-benefit comparison for each considered alternative to construction of the facility and an explanation of why the preferred alternative is the most effective means to achieve the stated project goals.

Designates the VA telehealth clinic in Craig, Colorado, as the "Major William Edward Adams Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic."

Extends to December 31, 2018, specified authority for: (1) treatment, rehabilitation, and additional services for seriously mentally ill and homeless veterans; (2) housing assistance for homeless veterans; (3) the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans; and (4) transfers of real property under the Secretary's jurisdiction or control. Extends to September 30, 2020, the recovery audit program for certain fee basis and other medical services contracts concerning non-VA care and services for veterans and beneficiaries.</summary>
