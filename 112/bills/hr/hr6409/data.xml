Makes conforming whistleblower amendments to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the federal criminal code with respect to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974.

Establishes in the Department of Labor an Administrative Review Board with jurisdiction and authority to decide appeals from administrative decisions and issue final agency decisions on behalf of the Secretary.
