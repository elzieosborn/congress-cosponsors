  <summary date="2011-05-27T14:47:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Southern Borderlands Public Safety Communications Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to make competitive grants for public-private partnerships that finance equipment and infrastructure to improve the public safety of persons who are residents of rural areas of the United States near the border with Mexico by enhancing their access to reliable mobile communications. Directs the Secretary to focus on projects in areas impacted by the illegal smuggling and trafficking of people and drugs.

Declares that persons eligible for grants include states, counties, municipalities, organizations representing agricultural producers and other rural Americans, and telecommunications providers.

Repeals the International Forestry Cooperation Act of 1990 to offset sums appropriated under this Act.</summary>
