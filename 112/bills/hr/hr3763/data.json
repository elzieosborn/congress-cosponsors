    "text": "FCC Merging Entities Regulatory Guidance and Ethical Reform Act of 2011 or the FCC MERGER Act - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to create and implement rules requiring public disclosure of contributions (including financial contributions, contributions in-kind, language to be filed, and offers of employment) received by any party that submits to the FCC facts, arguments, offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment, whenever such contributions may constitute a potential conflict of interest.\n\nRequires that such rules: (1) be applicable to all FCC proceedings, including rulemakings, transfers of licenses, mergers, combinations, and adjudicatory proceedings; and (2) include a requirement of a description of any contributions received from any party or applicant within one year of any such proceeding pending before the FCC, where such contributions may constitute a conflict of interest.\n\nAllows contributions to constitute a potential conflict of interest if made by a party with a direct financial interest in the outcome of a pending FCC proceeding.\n\nProhibits a former FCC official from accepting employment from a regulated entity as an employee, officer, director, or consultant within a one year after: (1) presiding over the transfer of licenses acquired or formerly held by the entity offering employment to the officer; (2) presiding over a merger, combination, or adjudicatory proceeding in which the entity offering employment was a party to the proceeding; or (3) issuing a decision to approve such a transfer or with respect to such proceedings.\n\nAuthorizes the Attorney General (DOJ) to bring a civil action in an appropriate U.S. district court against any person who engages in such prohibited conduct concerning the employment of a former or current FCC official. Sets forth civil penalties for individuals and organizations engaging in such conduct."
