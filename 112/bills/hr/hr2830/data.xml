Amends the federal criminal code to expand the scope of the prohibition against a U.S. citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence travelling in foreign commerce and engaging in illicit sexual conduct to include such individuals engaging in travel affecting foreign commerce and to apply even if such an individual is residing temporarily or permanently in a foreign jurisdiction. Provides that it is not a defense that a defendant is not criminally liable or is subject to reduced criminal liability due to the de jure or de facto acceptance of the illicit conduct in the foreign jurisdiction in which the defendant travels or resides.

Amends the TVPA to include the Director of the Peace Corps as a member of the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking.

Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to designate a Director of Anti-Trafficking Policies.

Amends the TVPA to provide benefits and services for non-immigrants who are victims of criminal trafficking.

Authorizes the Secretary to permit an alien to remain in the United States, if a federal law enforcement official files an application stating that an alien may be a victim of a severe form of trafficking and may be a potential witness to such trafficking, to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for such crime. Requires such official to respond to a request for continued presence in the United States within 15 days and to approve or deny the application for continued presence within 1 month.

Directs the Secretary of State to include in specified required reports a description of U.S. efforts to comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.

Prohibits knowingly destroying or concealing or confiscating for more than 48 hours the passport or other immigration or personal identification document of an individual: (1) in violation of specified provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or (2) in order to, without lawful authority, maintain, prevent, or restrict the labor or services of the individual.

Makes fraud in foreign labor contracting a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit the adjustment of status of a nonimmigrant to that of a person admitted for permanent residence if the activities rendering the alien inadmissible were caused by, or incident to, victimization under provisions regarding victims of trafficking in persons.

Amends the Wilberforce Act to: (1) provide that, to the extent feasible, unaccompanied alien children from countries that are contiguous with the United States should be housed and screened by an immigration officer with expertise in child welfare in separate child-friendly facilities conducive to disclosing information related to human trafficking or exploitation; and (2) require each federal agency to notify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) within 24 (currently 48) hours regarding the apprehension or discovery of an unaccompanied alien child or regarding any claim or suspicion that an alien in custody is under age 18.

Amends Social Security Act provisions regarding federal payments for foster care and adoption assistance to require state plans for such assistance, by January 1, 2013, to describe state child welfare existing practice and future plans regarding prevention measures and victim assistance related to the human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of foreign, U.S. citizen, and legal resident children.
