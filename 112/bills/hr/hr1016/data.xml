Assessing Progress in Haiti Act - Directs the President to report to Congress on the status of post-earthquake humanitarian, reconstruction, and development efforts in Haiti, including efforts to prevent the spread of cholera and treat persons infected with the disease.

Requires such report to evaluate: (1) the overall progress of relief, recovery, and reconstruction in Haiti, including U.S. government programs, programs to protect vulnerable populations, and projects to improve water, sanitation, and health; (2) the extent to which U.S. and international efforts are in line with the government of Haiti's priorities and are working through Haitian ministries and local authorities; (3) coordination among U.S. government agencies and coordination between the U.S. government and U.N. agencies, international financial institutions, and other bilateral donors; (4) mechanisms for communicating the progress of recovery and reconstruction to Haitian citizens; (5) mechanisms through which Haitian civil society and the Haitian diaspora are participating in recovery and reconstruction; and (6) Haiti's suitability to receive aliens who are removed, excluded, or deported from the United States and steps Haiti is taking to strengthen its capacity in this regard.</summary>
