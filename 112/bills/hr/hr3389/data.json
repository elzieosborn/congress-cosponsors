    "text": "Consortia-Led Energy Advancement Networks Act or the CLEAN Act - Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to carry out a program to establish Clean Energy Consortia to enhance the nation's economic, environmental, and energy security by promoting commercial application of clean energy technology and ensuring that the United States maintains a technological lead in the development and commercial application of state-of-the-art energy technologies.\n\nDefines \"clean energy technology\" to mean a technology that: (1) produces energy from solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, tidal, wave, ocean, and other renewable energy resources (as defined by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978); (2) more efficiently transmits, distributes, or stores energy; (3) enhances energy efficiency for buildings and industry; (4) enables the development of a Smart Grid (as defined by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007); (5) produces an advanced or sustainable material with energy or energy efficiency applications; (6) improves energy efficiency for transportation; or (7) enhances water security through improved water management, conservation, distribution, and end use applications.\n\nRequires such Consortia, with prior approval of the Secretary, to distribute awards to support clean energy technology projects conducting translational research. Defines \"translational research\" as coordination of research with technical applications to enable discoveries or inventions to achieve commercial application of energy technology. Requires at least 50% of such support to be provided to projects related to such Consortium's clean energy technology development focus.\n\nRequires each Consortium to establish an External Advisory Committee to review the Consortium's proposed plans, programs, project selection, and projects.\n\nRequires the Secretary to award grants to six regional Consortia, each for an initial period not to exceed five years for such clean energy technology projects. Authorizes the Secretary to extend such award term by up to five additional years. Prohibits grants from being used for construction of new buildings or facilities."
