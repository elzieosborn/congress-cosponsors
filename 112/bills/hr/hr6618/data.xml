Requires the Committee to: (1) gather views from federal, state, local, and tribal agencies that work to support public safety and justice; (2) recommend to the Attorney General measures to improve the administration of justice and protect the public by promoting practices and technologies for database interoperability and the secure sharing of justice and public safety information between local, state, and tribal governments and the federal government; and (3) report annually on issues considered and recommendations made.
