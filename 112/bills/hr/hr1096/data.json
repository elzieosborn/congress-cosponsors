Recognizes that each state has authority to protect the lives of unborn children residing in the jurisdiction of that state.\n\nAmends the federal judicial code to remove Supreme Court and district court jurisdiction to review cases arising out of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice, or any act interpreting such a measure, on the grounds that such measure: (1) protects the rights of human persons between conception and birth; or (2) prohibits, limits, or regulates the performance of abortions or the provision of public funds, facilities, personnel, or other assistance for abortions.\n\nMakes this Act and the amendments made by this Act applicable to any case pending on, or commenced on or after, the date of enactment."
