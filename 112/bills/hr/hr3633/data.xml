  <summary date="2012-02-13T21:14:58Z" status="Introduced in House">Help Our Hospitals Act of 2011 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2011, to repeal their reductions to Medicare disproportionate share (DSH) payments for FY2015 and ensuing fiscal years, especially to subsection (d) hospitals, to reflect lower uncompensated care costs relative to increases in the number of insured.

(Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)</summary>
