        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Costa motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to express the sense of the House that a five-year Farm Bill would provide greater certainty and stability for America's farm families than extending farm policy for only one year or authorizing short-term disaster assistance. The Motion would also prohibit foreign corporations from receiving disaster assistance. Lastly, the Motion would require the Secretary of Agriculture to prevent duplicative payments for assistance.</text>
