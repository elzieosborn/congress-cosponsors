  <summary date="2012-05-21T19:58:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Postal Service Accountability Act of 2012 - Directs the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), in making a determination whether to close or consolidate a post office, to consider the economic effects on the community served by such post office.

Increases from 60 to 120 days the waiting period during which the USPS is prohibited from taking action to close or consolidate a post office after its written determination is made available to persons served by such post office.

Establishes a waiting period and appeal procedures for USPS determinations to close or consolidate mail processing facilities. (Current law addresses such procedures only with respect to post offices.)

Permits facility employees or members of the community in which such a facility is located to appeal to the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) any USPS determination to close or consolidate a mail processing facility.

Requires the USPS to consider, among other factors, whether a closing or consolidation is consistent with the policy to provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining.

Specifies, upon an appeal of a USPS determination to close or consolidate a post office or mail processing facility, that the PRC's authority to set aside the USPS determination includes a determination by the PRC that USPS conclusions with respect to specific factors are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record.

Prohibits the USPS, if an appeal is filed, from closing or consolidating a post office or mail processing facility without the written concurrence of at least three PRC Commissioners.

Requires the USPS, within one year after a post office or mail processing facility is closed or consolidated, to review and make public its findings in regard to the accuracy of its earlier findings and whether substitute services are meeting community needs.</summary>
