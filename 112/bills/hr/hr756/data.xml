  <summary date="2011-04-19T18:19:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study the detention of commercial motor vehicle operators by shippers and receivers before loading and unloading their vehicles.

Directs the Secretary to prescribe standards for the maximum number of hours that a commercial motor vehicle operator transporting property in interstate commerce may be reasonably detained, if not compensated for the time detained, by a shipper or receiver before the loading or unloading of the vehicle.

Prohibits a shipper or receiver from detaining such operators before the loading or unloading of a vehicle without providing compensation for the time detained beyond the maximum number of hours that the Secretary determines is reasonable.

Prescribes penalties for violation of this prohibition.</summary>
