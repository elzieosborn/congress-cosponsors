Defines \"resilient construction requirements\" as\u00a0requirements that ensure that such\u00a0buildings: (1) can resist hazards brought\u00a0on by a major disaster and can continue to provide their primary functions after a major disaster, (2) can reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruptive event, and (3)\u00a0have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event.\n\nTerminates such credit for any any property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after December 31, 2015."
