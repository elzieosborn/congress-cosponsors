  <summary date="2012-06-20T21:53:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Disaster Savings and Resilient Construction Act of 2012 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for the cost of constructing commercial and residential buildings&#160;that comply with resilient construction requirements in a federally-declared major disaster area. Defines "resilient construction requirements" as&#160;requirements that ensure that such&#160;buildings: (1) can resist hazards brought&#160;on by a major disaster and can continue to provide their primary functions after a major disaster, (2) can reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruptive event, and (3)&#160;have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event.

Terminates such credit for any any property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after December 31, 2015.</summary>
