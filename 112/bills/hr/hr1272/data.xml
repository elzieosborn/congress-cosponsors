  <summary date="2012-10-17T14:57:44Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 30, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Minnesota Chippewa Tribe Judgment Fund Distribution Act of 2012 - (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to reimburse the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe for the amount, plus interest, that the Tribe contributed for the payment of attorneys' fees and litigation expenses associated with the litigation of Docket No. 19 and No. 188 before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the distribution of judgment funds.

Requires the Tribe's claim for reimbursement of expended funds to be certified by the Tribe as being unreimbursed to it from other funding sources.

Requires payment of interest on such funds at the rate of 6% per year from the date such funds were expended until they are reimbursed to the Tribe.

Requires use of the judgment funds to reimburse the Tribe for those attorneys' fees and litigation expenses. (Sec. 5) Requires the Tribe to provide the Secretary with updated membership rolls for the Boise Forte Band, Fond du Lac Band, Grand Portage Band, Leech Lake Band, Mille Lacs Band, and White Earth Band of the Tribe.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) distribute to each Band, from the remaining judgment funds, an amount sufficient to enable each Band to pay $300 to each Band member; and (2) divide the funds that remain after that distribution, as well as unclaimed payments, into equal shares for each Band.

(Sec. 6) Prohibits funds disbursed under this Act from being liable for the payment of a recipient's previously contracted obligations.</summary>
