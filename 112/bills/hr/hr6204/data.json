Exempts certain state-regulated investment advisers from the requirement to pay an annual fee.\n\nPrescribes a fee calculation formula. Requires the SEC to make the formula publicly available on its website along with the factors used to reach the fee determination.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to audit biennially the use of such fees, SEC reviews of the fee formula, and any adjustments to it.\n\nMakes such fees available to the SEC, without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation, to pay costs associated with inspecting and examining investment advisers."
