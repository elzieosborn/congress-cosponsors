  <summary date="2012-05-23T19:43:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Schools of the Future Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive three- to five-year grants to eligible partnerships to implement and evaluate the results of technology-based learning practices, strategies, tools, or courses at rural schools.

Defines "eligible partnerships" as those composed of a school partner, a digital learning partner, and an evaluation partner.

Describes a "school partner" as a local educational agency, charter school network, consortium of elementary or secondary schools, regional educational service provider, or consortium of such entities.

Includes among the grant-funded technology-based learning practices, strategies, tools, or courses, those that: (1) personalize the learning experience, (2) aid and inform instruction, (3) meet the needs of students with specific educational needs, (4) help students develop 21st century skills, and (5) give students access to courses that would otherwise be unavailable to them.

Requires each partnership's evaluation partner, after the third year of the grant, to evaluate the effect of the technology-based learning practices, strategies, tools, or courses on student achievement.</summary>
