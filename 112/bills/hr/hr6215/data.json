The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAmends the Trademark Act of 1946 to specify that ownership of a valid federal registration of a mark is a complete bar to an action with respect to the mark that: (1) is brought by another person under the common law or a statute of a state; and (2) seeks to prevent dilution (by blurring or by tarnishment) or asserts any claim of actual or likely damage or harm to the distinctiveness or reputation of a mark, label, or form of advertisement. (Removes any such federal-registration defense with respect to dilution claims under federal law and specifies that such a defense is only available in response to dilution claims under state law.)"
