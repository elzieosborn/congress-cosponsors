    "text": "Border Enforcement Security Task Force Act of 2011 - Establishes in United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) a Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) program to enhance border security by addressing and reducing border security threats and violence by: (1) facilitating collaboration among federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies to execute coordinated activities in furtherance of border security and homeland security; and (2) enhancing information-sharing among such agencies.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), acting through the Assistant Secretary for ICE, to establish BEST units after considering: (1) whether the area where the unit would be established is significantly impacted by cross-border threats; (2) the availability of federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law enforcement resources to participate in the unit; and (3) the extent to which border security threats are having a significant harmful impact in the area and in other jurisdictions. Authorizes the Secretary, in order to provide federal assistance to the area so designated, to: (1) obligate such sums as are appropriated for the BEST program; (2) direct the assignment of federal personnel to that program; and (3) take other actions to assist state, local, tribal, and foreign jurisdictions to participate.\n\nDirects the Secretary to report on the effectiveness of the program in enhancing border security and reducing the drug trafficking, arms smuggling, illegal alien trafficking and smuggling, violence, and kidnapping along and across U.S. borders."
