  <summary date="2011-02-17T17:17:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Coastal Jobs Creation Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to implement a Coastal Jobs Creation Grant Program which shall include: (1) cooperative research to collect and compile economic and social data related to recreational and commercial fisheries management: (2) establishment and implementation of state recreational fishing registry programs; (3) training and deploying observers authorized or required under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; (4) preservation or restoration of coastal resources identified for their conservation, recreational, ecological, historic, or aesthetic values; (5) redevelopment of deteriorating and underutilized working waterfronts and ports; (6) research to develop, test, and deploy innovations and improvements in coastal and ocean observation technologies; (7) cooperative research to collect data to improve, supplement, or enhance fishery and marine mammal stock assessments; and (8) other specified activities.

Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to require the Secretary to enter into contracts with, or provide grants to, states for the purpose of establishing and implementing a registry program to meet the requirements for the exemption from registration of a regional standardized fishing vessel registration and information management system program for state licensed recreational fishermen and charter fishing vessels when the Secretary determines that information from the state program is suitable for the Secretary's use in completing marine recreational fisheries statistical surveys or evaluating the effects of proposed conservation and management measures for marine recreational fisheries.</summary>
