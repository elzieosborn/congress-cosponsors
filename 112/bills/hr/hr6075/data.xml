  <summary date="2012-09-12T15:45:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Permits the chief executive of a state to exempt persons in the state acting in their capacity as farmers from a requirement of a covered federal environmental law by determining that such requirement is unduly burdensome to such persons.

Requires the chief executive to solicit and accept public comments for at least 90 days before finalizing any such determination.

Defines "covered federal environmental law" to mean the Clean Air Act insofar as it applies to emissions of air pollutants other than those resulting from the combustion of fossil fuel, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), and the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</summary>
