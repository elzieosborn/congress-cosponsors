  <summary date="2012-05-24T19:11:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Routine HIV Screening Coverage Act of 2012 - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to require group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage to provide coverage for routine HIV screening under terms and conditions no less favorable than for other routine preventive health services. Prohibits such a plan from taking specified actions to avoid the requirements of this Act.

Requires inclusion of a notice of such screening coverage in the uniform summary of benefits and coverage explanation provided by the group health plan or health insurance issuer.

Defines "routine HIV screening" as having the meaning given the term by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) after consultation with the the Office of National AIDS Policy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health care professionals, and other qualified individuals.

Applies requirements of this Act to health insurance coverage offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.</summary>
