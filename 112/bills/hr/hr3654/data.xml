  <summary date="2012-01-17T18:28:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Allowing Local Emergency Response Technicians to Accept Cellular Texts Act or the ALERT ACT - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to complete a rulemaking requiring that if a consumer unsuccessfully attempts to communicate with a public safety answering point by sending a text message to 9-1-1 using a commercial mobile service, the provider of such service will respond with an error message to ensure that the consumer knows that the message has not been received by the answering point and to instruct the consumer on proper steps to reach emergency assistance.

Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that at least 10% of the federal funds awarded after enactment of this Act for emergency management performance grants authorized by the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 be used to test or implement equipment or services allowing members of the public to send 9-1-1 text messages to obtain emergency assistance.</summary>
