  <summary date="2011-09-06T16:07:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Banking Improvement Act of 2011 - Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from requiring any financial institution or any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents to report any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation if a person involved in such transaction is a legitimate business.

Deems a person a legitimate business if the governor of each state in which such person does business has certified to the Secretary that: (1) the person is a business engaged in activities currently legal under state law, and (2) the state has an interest in exempting such person from mandatory reporting of suspicious transactions.

Requires the Secretary to maintain a public website with a list of all persons deemed to be a legitimate business for purposes of this Act.</summary>
