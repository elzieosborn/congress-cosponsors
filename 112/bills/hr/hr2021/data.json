Prohibits: (1) the Environmental Appeals Board of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from having any authority to consider any matter regarding the consideration, issuance, or denial of such permit;\u00a0 and (2) extending any administrative stay of the effectiveness of such permit beyond six months after the date of filing of such application."
