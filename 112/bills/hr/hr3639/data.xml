Requires such individuals to comply with this Act within 30 days after taking office, or, if an incumbent, within 30 days after enactment of this Act.

Allows the President and Vice President to file with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics for an additional 30-day extension in order to comply with this Act.

Allows a Member of Congress to file, as appropriate, with the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate for such 30-day extension.
