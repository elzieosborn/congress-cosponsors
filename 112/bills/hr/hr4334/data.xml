Requires the Secretary to develop a management plan for the Organ Mountains monument.

Releases the Organ Mountains, Organ Needles, and Pena Blanca Wilderness Study Areas from further study for designation as wilderness and prohibits such Areas from any longer being subject to requirements under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 regarding the status of their lands during the period of review and determination of such areas for preservation as wilderness.
