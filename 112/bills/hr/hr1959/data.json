Extends the required amortization period for geological and geophysical expenditures.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that increases in revenue resulting from this Act should be used to make additional expenditures for clean energy programs, including for alternative fuel technology, research and development, clean energy loan guarantees, and low-income home energy assistance."
