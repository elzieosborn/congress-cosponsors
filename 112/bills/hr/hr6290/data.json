Provides an exception in the case of a military operation to directly thwart or repel an offensive military action launched against the United States or an ally with whom the United States has a mutual defense assistance agreement.\n\nProhibits any unit or individual of the U.S. Armed Forces or IC element from being deployed in support of a NATO military operation absent express prior statutory authorization from Congress, unless under the exception described above."
