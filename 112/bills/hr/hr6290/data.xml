  <summary date="2012-10-31T12:43:11Z" status="Introduced in House">States that it is the policy of the United States: (1) to protect the role of Congress as a coequal branch of government and ensure protection of its constitutional authority to declare war and support the Armed Forces; (2) to prevent the need for U.S. and international military intervention abroad through the utilization of diplomacy to resolve issues of concern to the United States and the international community; and (3) that no federal funds may be used to carry out any North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military operation or to deploy a unit of individual of the U.S. Armed Forces or an element of the intelligence community (IC) in support of a NATO military operation unless the President determines that such operation is warranted and seeks express prior authorization by Congress, as required under the Constitution. Provides an exception in the case of a military operation to directly thwart or repel an offensive military action launched against the United States or an ally with whom the United States has a mutual defense assistance agreement.

Prohibits any unit or individual of the U.S. Armed Forces or IC element from being deployed in support of a NATO military operation absent express prior statutory authorization from Congress, unless under the exception described above.</summary>
