  <summary date="2012-11-19T15:20:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Reducing food-based Inorganic and Organic Compounds Exposure Act of 2012 or the RICE Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to promulgate a final regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act establishing the minimum quantity of total arsenic contained in rice or a rice product that will cause the rice or rice product to be deemed to be adulterated under the Act.

Requires the regulation to: (1) apply the minimum quantity to rice and rice products regardless of the origin of the arsenic, (2) include the establishment of tolerances, and (3) establish a standard for total arsenic based on the maximum achievable reduction in cancer risk and be at least as protective as the allowable level set for total arsenic in bottled water under the Act.</summary>
