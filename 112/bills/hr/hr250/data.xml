  <summary date="2011-01-14T20:47:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act, in the case of an alien subject to removal, deportation, or exclusion and who is the parent of a U.S. citizen child, to authorize an immigration judge to decline to order such removal if the judge determines such action to be against the child's best interests.

States that such discretion shall not apply to an alien when the judge determines that the alien: (1) is excludable or deportable on security grounds; or (2) has engaged in sex trafficking or severe forms of trafficking in persons.</summary>
