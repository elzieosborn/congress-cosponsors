  <summary date="2011-05-03T20:09:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Critical Care Assessment and Improvement Act of 2011 - Requires studies on critical care in the United States by the Institute of Medicine and the Comptroller General.&#160; 

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to establish the Critical Care Coordinating Council to coordinate the collection and analysis of information on current NIH research relating to the care of the critically ill and injured, identify gaps in such research, and make recommendations to the Director of NIH on how to improve such research.

Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the adequacy of the number of critical care practitioners in disaster medical assistance teams, the Medical Reserve Corps, and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.

Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to develop guidelines or best practices for the evacuation of intensive care units during a national health emergency, including a pandemic or natural disaster, that ensure the safe and effective evacuation of all individuals regardless of age, disability, or life expectancy.

Requires the Secretary to establish the Panel on Emergency Preparedness Databases to: (1) assess the adequacy of existing national preparedness databases in facilitating effective and coordinated medical responses during a national health emergency; (2) identify gaps in existing information networks; and&#160; (3) recommend specific ways to improve awareness of the availability of resources before, during, and after an incident.

Prohibits the Secretary from using any finding or recommendation developed under this Act in making coverage, reimbursement, or incentive determinations under any program in a a manner that precludes or discourages an individual from choosing a health care treatment based on how the individual values the tradeoff between extending the length of life and the risk of disability.</summary>
