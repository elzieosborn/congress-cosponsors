  <summary date="2011-09-09T18:31:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Spectrum for Innovation Act of 2011 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to modify regulations concerning radio frequency devices to allow unlicensed U-NII (Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure) devices, as specified, to operate in the electromagnetic spectrum between the frequencies of 5350-5470 and 5850-5925 megahertz, provided that: (1) licensed users will be protected by technical solutions, including use of existing, modified, or new spectrum-sharing technologies and solutions, such as dynamic frequency selection; and (2) the primary mission of federal spectrum users in such frequency bands will not be compromised by introducing unlicensed devices.

Requires the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to submit to Congress a study on known and proposed spectrum-sharing technologies and the risk to federal users if unlicensed U-NII devices were allowed to operate in such bands.</summary>
