  <summary date="2012-07-30T18:44:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Siletz Tribe Indian Restoration Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to take into trust for the Siletz Tribe additional lands that lie within the original 1855 Siletz Coast Reservation and are located in Benton, Douglas, Lane, Lincoln, Tillamook, or Yamhill County in Oregon.

Requires such land to be considered and evaluated as an on-reservation acquisition and become part of the Tribe's reservation. (Off-reservation land acquisition requests require the Secretary to give greater scrutiny to the tribe's justification of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition.)

Prohibits gaming on lands taken into trust pursuant to this Act.</summary>
