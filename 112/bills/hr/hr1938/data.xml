  <summary date="2011-10-19T20:03:58Z" status="Passed House amended">North American-Made Energy Security Act - Directs the President, acting through the Secretary of Energy (DOE), to coordinate with each federal agency responsible for coordinating or considering an aspect of the President's National Interest Determination and Presidential Permit decision regarding construction and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline (from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, and then on to the U.S. Gulf Coast through Cushing, Oklahoma) to ensure that all necessary actions are taken on an expedited schedule.

Requires each such agency to comply with any deadline the Secretary establishes.

Directs the President, within 30 days after the final environmental impact statement, but not later than November 1, 2011, to issue a final order granting or denying the Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.

States that no action by the Secretary pursuant to this Act shall affect any duty or responsibility to comply with any requirement to conduct environmental review.

Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States must decrease its dependence on oil from countries hostile to its interests, and (2) increased access to Canadian energy resources will create jobs in the United States.</summary>
