Makes such rule effective 180 days after the Agency submits such report if Congress has not voted to override its implementation.\n\nProhibits any athlete who participates in an event sponsored or licensed by the sport's national governing body, or otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, the World Anti-Doping Agency, or the International Association of Athletics Federation, from being fined, suspended, expelled, or otherwise penalized unless such athlete has been: (1) served with written specific charges providing dates and times of alleged conduct in question, (2) given a reasonable time to prepare his or her defense, and (3) afforded a full and fair hearing."
