  <summary date="2011-02-23T20:52:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Freezes the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress through December 31, 2012, and reduces it by 10% in 2013.

Requires the President to subject executive branch employees to two weeks of mandatory unpaid leave (or the pro rata equivalent in the case of employees serving for less than the entire fiscal year) during FY2012. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to apply such requirement to judicial branch employees. Allows exceptions for reasons of national security or reasons relating to the public health or safety, including effective law enforcement.

Limits the aggregate amount which may be appropriated or otherwise made available for FY2012 for allowances and expenses (including salaries) of any legislative branch office, except the U.S. Capitol Police, to 96% of the aggregate amount appropriated or otherwise made available for FY2011 for such allowances and expenses.</summary>
