  <summary date="2012-02-24T14:41:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to impose sanctions on a foreign financial institution that employs a member of the board of directors of an entity that provides, or facilitates access to, services relating to secure communications, electronic funds transfers, or cable transfers to the Central Bank of Iran or a sanctioned financial institution.

 Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from prohibiting or conditioning the opening or maintaining in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account by a foreign financial institution for employing a member of the board of directors of such an entity if the services relate to petroleum-related transactions from Iran that occur before the date on which specified sanctions apply.</summary>
