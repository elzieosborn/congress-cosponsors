  <summary date="2011-11-21T17:44:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Mobile Informational Call Act of 2011 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to revise the categories of calls (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party) in which people are prohibited from using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice. Prohibits such calls to any telephone number assigned to a cellular service, specialized mobile radio service, or other radio common carrier service, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call, unless the call is made for a commercial purpose that does not constitute a telephone solicitation.

Defines "prior express consent" as the oral or written approval of a person: (1) for the initiation of a telephone call to such person by or on behalf of an entity with which such person has an established business relationship, and (2) that is provided when such person purchases a good or service or at any other point during such relationship.

Deems a person who provides a telephone number as a means of contact to have evidenced such consent.

Prohibits a state from imposing any requirement or prohibition with respect to the use of telephone equipment subject to federally regulated restrictions, except for telephone solicitations.</summary>
