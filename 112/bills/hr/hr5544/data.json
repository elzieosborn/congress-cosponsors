Expresses the sense of Congress that, whenever the land acquired by Minnesota is not being used for revenue-gathering activities, it should make such land available for other compatible uses, including hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, snowmobiling, and trail riding.\n\nInstructs the Secretary to modify the boundaries of Superior National Forest to reflect the land exchange under this Act.\n\nStates that the land exchange under this Act shall not be considered to be a major federal action.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from taking into consideration the lands acquired by the United States in determining the appraisal value of System lands in Minnesota used for the purposes of making payments to Minnesota under the Thye-Blatnik Act and Humphrey-Thye-Blatnik-Andreson Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report to Congress, if the Secretary fails to complete the land exchange within the 18-month period following enactment of this Act."
