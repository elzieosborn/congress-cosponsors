  <summary date="2012-03-05T17:51:45Z" status="Introduced in House">North American Energy Security Act - Directs the President, acting through the Secretary of State, to grant a permit under Executive Order 13337 (relating to issuance of permits for certain energy-related facilities and land transportation crossings on the international boundaries of the United States) for the Keystone XL pipeline project application filed on September 19, 2008.

Declares that the President shall not be required to grant such permit upon a determination that the Keystone XL pipeline would not serve the national interest.

Requires the President, within 15 days after making such a determination, to report to certain congressional committees as well as to the majority and minority leadership of the Senate and the House a justification for it, including consideration of economic, employment, energy security, foreign policy, trade, and environmental factors.

States that if the President does not make a determination that the Keystone XL pipeline would not serve the national interest, and take action within 60 days after enactment of this Act, the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline shall be in effect by operation of law.

Sets forth permit requirements, including: (1) the reconsideration of routing of the Keystone XL pipeline within Nebraska, and (2) a review period during which routing within Nebraska may be reconsidered and the route of the pipeline through the state altered.

Declares that, if the President does not approve the route within Nebraska submitted by the governor of Nebraska within 10 days after submission, the route submitted by the governor shall be considered approved by operation of law.</summary>
