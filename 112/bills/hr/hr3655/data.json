Specifies that this requirement shall not apply to an issuer that has a total public float for the relevant reporting period of less than $1 billion.\n\nProhibits this Act from being construed to relieve or exempt an issuer from the internal control reporting and assessment requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or from its requirement that officers of the issuer certify certain annual and quarterly reports."
