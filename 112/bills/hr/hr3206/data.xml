  <summary date="2012-02-13T23:04:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Cultivating Scientific Expertise to Foster Innovation for Patients Act of 2011 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to revise provisions related to financial interests of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee members to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that individual appointments to advisory committees are made to promote scientific and technical expertise while at the same time minimizing any potential conflicts of interest. Requires the Secretary to consider, with respect to any financial interest constituting a potential conflict of interest, the type, nature, and magnitude of the financial interest. Declares that no specific factor shall be dispositive in the Secretary's evaluation of a particular financial interest.

Repeals the prohibition specifically applicable to FDA that prevents a member of an advisory committee from participating with respect to a particular matter if such individual or an immediate family member of such individual has a financial interest that could be affected by the advice given to the Secretary.</summary>
