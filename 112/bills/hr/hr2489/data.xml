  <summary date="2012-11-01T20:03:51Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 17, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

American Battlefield Protection Program Amendments of 2012 - Amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, with respect to the Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program, to: (1) expand the current definition of "battlefield report" to include the report entitled "Report to Congress on the Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Sites in the United States," and (2) expand the Program to permit the acquisition not only of an "interest in an eligible site," but also an "eligible site."

Requires acquisitions of lands or interests under the Act to be from willing sellers only.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit to Congress a report on activities carried out under this Act.

Prohibits the use of any acquisition grant program funds for purposes of lobbying.

Extends the authorization of appropriations to provide grants through FY2017.</summary>
