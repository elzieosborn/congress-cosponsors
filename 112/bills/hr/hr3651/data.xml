  <summary date="2012-02-14T21:01:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to make an exemption from the requirement that a creditor in a non-credit card consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on the principal dwelling (other than a reverse mortgage) establish an escrow or impound account for mandatory periodic payments or premiums (including taxes, insurance, and ground rents).

 Exempts a creditor with less than $1 billion in assets from: (1) this requirement when the consumer credit transaction has an annual percentage rate exceeding the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set by 1.5 or more percentage points; and (2) any other provision of such Act that requires the creditor to establish an escrow or impound account with respect to such a transaction.</summary>
