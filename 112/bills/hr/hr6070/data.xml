  <summary date="2012-09-12T15:28:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study to determine the impact on the United States of the policy set forth in the memorandum dated June 15, 2012, from the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding exercising prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals who came to the United States illegally as children.

Requires the study to examine the impact on: (1) national security, including how much implementing this policy will cost the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in terms of manpower and other costs; (2) fraud, including how impacted federal agencies will address an increase in fraudulent documents; (3) U.S. workers, including the effectiveness of programs under the Social Security Act (such as Medicare), the national unemployment rate and unemployment compensation, and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and (4) the U.S. economy, including federal Pell grants, the supplemental nutrition assistance program, college admissions and scholarships, and federal work-study programs.

Directs the Secretary to refrain from implementing such policy until after the Comptroller General has reported to Congress on the results of such study.</summary>
