Requires each eligible entity to demonstrate that it is a part of a multidisciplinary partnership that includes a law enforcement agency, a prosecutor's office, a victim service provider, and a nonprofit program or government agency with demonstrated experience in assisting individuals in later life.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to give priority to proposals providing population-specific services to racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved populations.\n\nAmends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to replace the term \"elder law\" with \"abuse in later life.\""
