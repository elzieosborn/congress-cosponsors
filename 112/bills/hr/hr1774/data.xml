  <summary date="2011-07-12T12:57:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Increasing Access to Voluntary Screening for HIV/AIDS and STIs Act of 2011 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require a state plan to provide coverage of routine screening services for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with no cost sharing for such screening services.

Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of SSA to require coverage of such screening services. Sets forth requirements for such screenings.

Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to require health plans to provide coverage for such screening under terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms and conditions applicable to other routine health screenings. Prohibits certain actions to avoid these requirements. Applies such requirement to the federal employees health benefits program.

Permits state Medicaid plans to provide medical coverage of individuals who have HIV/AIDS and whose income and resources do not exceed the maximum amount of income or resources disabled individuals may have to obtain such medical assistance. Provides for reimbursement to states at an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for such coverage. Excludes such coverage from the limitations on Medicaid payments to territories.

Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) track national HIV/AIDS and STI screening trends and the burdens of HIV/AIDS and STIs among people with disabilities; (2) make sex education materials that promote voluntary screening for HIV/AIDS and STIs accessible to the deaf and hearing loss community and to people with intellectual disabilities; (3) ensure that national screening guidelines for cervical cancer state that women who have sex with women should have the same guidelines as women who have sex only with men; and (4) improve information collection concerning the transmission, morbidity, and screening for HIV/AIDS and STIs in transgender communities.</summary>
