Exempts employers from withholding of tax and information reporting requirements for employees not subject to income tax under this Act. Allows an employer, for purposes of determining penalties related to employer withholding or reporting requirements, to rely on an employee's annual determination of the time such employee will spend working in a state in the absence of fraud or collusion by such employee.\n\nExempts from the definition of \"employee\" for purposes of this Act professional athletes, professional entertainers, and public figures who are persons of prominence who perform services for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.\n\nMakes this Act effective on January 1 of the 2nd year that begins after the enactment of this Act. Renders this Act inapplicable to any tax obligation that accrues before the effective date of this Act."
