    "text": "Taxpayer and Gas Price Relief Act of 2011 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny major integrated oil companies: (1)\u00a0a tax deduction for income attributable to producing, refining, processing, transporting, or distributing oil, gas, or primary products thereof; (2) the last-in, first-out inventory method; and (3) deductions for intangible drilling and development costs in the case of oil and gas wells.\n\nDeficit Reduction Through Fair Oil Royalties Act - Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from issuing new oil or natural gas production leases in the Gulf of Mexico\u00a0under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to certain lessees unless\u00a0they have\u00a0renegotiated covered leases to require the payment of royalties if the price of oil and natural gas is greater than or equal to specified OCSLA price thresholds.\n\nRequires rentals or royalties received by the United States to be deposited in the Treasury for federal budget deficit reduction or, if there is no federal budget deficit, for reducing the federal debt.\n\nDirects the Secretary to agree to a lessee's request to amend any lease issued for any Central and Western Gulf of Mexico tract in the period of January 1, 1996, through November 28, 2000, to incorporate price thresholds applicable to royalty suspension requirements that are equal to or less than the price thresholds specified under OCSLA.\n\nFederal Price Gouging Prevention Act - Makes it unlawful for any person, during a proclaimed international crisis affecting the oil market, to sell gasoline or any other petroleum distillate at a price that: (1) is unconscionably excessive; and (2) indicates the seller is taking unfair advantage of the circumstances of the crisis to increase prices unreasonably. Authorizes the President to issue such a proclamation.\n\n Enhanced Supply and Price Reduction Act of 2011 or the Enhanced SPR Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to\u00a0authorize the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to\u00a0sell at least 30 million barrels of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and acquire refined petroleum product. Requires the Secretary to deposit the cash proceeds from such sales into the SPR Petroleum Account.\n\nAuthorizes the President to instruct the Secretary to drawdown and sell or exchange\u00a0petroleum product in a specified amount from the SPR if a circumstance exists of such significance and scope that action would be warranted to address market manipulation or otherwise be in the public interest."
