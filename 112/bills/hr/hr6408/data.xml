  <summary date="2012-09-28T16:47:59Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal Election Integrity Act of 2012 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit the appropriate state or local election official from providing a federal election ballot to an individual who desires to vote in person unless: (1) the individual presents to the official a government-issued, current, and valid photo identification (ID), and (2) the election official verifies that the ID is of the individual who requests the ballot.

Requires an individual who does not present such an ID to be permitted to cast a provisional ballot in such an election. Requires such individual, however, to present the required ID within 48 hours after casting the provisional ballot, or the appropriate state or local election official shall not determine the individual's eligibility to vote. Requires verification of the photo ID by the election official.

Requires individuals who vote other than in person in a federal election (for example, by mail) to submit a copy of such a photo ID with a ballot, or the appropriate official shall not accept the ballot. Requires verification of the photo ID by the election official. Exempts from this photo ID requirement the absentee ballot of any eligible overseas military voter absent from the United States by reason of active duty or service. Prohibits the appropriate state or local election official from providing a ballott for voting other than in person to an individual who requests such a ballot in person unless: (1) the individual presents the official a government-issued, current, and valid photo ID; and (2) the election official verifies it.

Requires states to establish a program to provide photo IDs in accordance with this Act to individuals who desire to vote but do not otherwise possess a government-issued photo ID. Prohibits any such photo ID from serving as a government-issued photo identification for purposes of operating a motor vehicle or any related purpose.

Prescribes requirements for any state fee for providing such a photo ID.

Requires the Election Assistance Commission to make payments to states to cover the costs incurred in providing photo IDs to individuals unable to afford the fee.</summary>
