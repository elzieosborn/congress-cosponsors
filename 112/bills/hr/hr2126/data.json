Applies to commercial property insurance the exemption of purchasing groups from state law.\n\nRevises procedures for: (1) submitting financial documents to state insurance commissioners, and (2) mandatory disclosures.\n\nImposes a fiduciary duty upon the board of directors of a risk retention group to operate in the best interests of the group.\n\nRedesignates the Act as the Risk Retention Act."
