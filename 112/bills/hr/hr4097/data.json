Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2012 - Allows the Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (the Board) to undertake such activities as may be necessary for the construction of a specified addition to the south end of the building of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (the expansion project).\n\nAuthorizes the Board to construct the expansion project and makes the Board responsible for the planning, design, engineering, and construction of the project. Requires the costs of those activities to be paid for using nonappropriated funds.\n\nDeclares that, all activities carried out under this Act shall be within the mission of the John. F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (the Kennedy Center) to serve as the national center for such arts.\n\nInstructs the Board: (1) before awarding a contract for the construction of the expansion project, to estimate any additional annual operations and maintenance costs (or savings) associated with the project; and (2) to account for any such additional costs in making a budget request for FY2014 and each fiscal year thereafter. Requires a final determination to proceed with such project to be based on the ability of the Board to accommodate any such identified additional costs within its other budget priorities.\n\nPermits the Board to acknowledge private contributions used to carry out the interior portion of the expansion project, but prohibits the acknowledgement of private contributions used on the exterior portion.\n\nRequires any acknowledgements of private contributions under this Act to be consistent with requirements under the John. F. Kennedy Center Act regarding the designation or installation of additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials in public areas of the Kennedy Center.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2013-FY2014 to the Board for: (1) maintenance, repair, and security; and (2) capital projects."
