    "text": "Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to establish a competitive program to provide between three and seven grants of up to $3 million to each recipient for each of three years to advance research and development and to demonstrate technologies, including plug-in hybrid technology, for advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles (vehicles with a gross weight between 14,000 and 56,000 pounds that are fueled, in part, by a rechargeable energy storage system, excluding truck tractors).\n\nRequires that each grant recipient complete two phases: (1) phase one, research and demonstration of advanced hybrid technology by producing or retrofitting one or more advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles; and (2) phase two, demonstration of advanced manufacturing processes and technologies by producing or retrofitting a minimum of 50 advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) conduct research into alternative power train designs for use in advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles; and (2) establish a pilot program through the National Laboratories and Technology Centers of the Department of Energy to research and test the effects on the domestic electric power grid of the widespread use of plug-in hybrid vehicles, including plug-in hybrid vehicles that are advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles.\n\nAmends the United States Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of 2007 to direct the Secretary to conduct an applied research program on energy storage systems to support vehicles with a gross weight over 16,000 pounds."
