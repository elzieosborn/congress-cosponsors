Kantishna Hills Renewable Energy Act of 2011 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for specified microhydro projects in the Kantishna Hills area within the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Defines "microhydro project" as a hydroelectric power generating facility with a maximum power generation capability of 100 kilowatts and includes any distribution or transmission lines required to serve such area.

Requires the Secretary to complete, no later than 180 days after the submission of a permit application, any analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 respecting any proposed or existing microhydro projects in such area.

Directs the Secretary to exchange Park and Preserve land near or adjacent to land owned by Doyon Tourism, Inc., located at the mouth of Eureka Creek for approximately 18 acres of land owned by Doyon Tourism within the Galena patented mining claim. Instructs the Secretary to seek to complete such exchange by February 2015. Permits, if the values of the tracts proposed for exchange are determined not to be equal, an equalization of such values to be achieved by adjusting the quantity of the acreage owned by Doyon Tourism.

Requires the land acquired by the Secretary to be administered as part of the Park and Preserve.</summary>
