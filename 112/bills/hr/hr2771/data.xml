  <summary date="2011-09-06T21:13:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Increases to five years the period during which a Cuban national must be physically present in the United States in order to adjust to permanent resident status.

Makes an alien who returns to Cuba after admission or parole into the United States ineligible for such status adjustment.

Rescinds such adjusted status in the case of an alien who returns to Cuba before being granted U.S. citizenship and subjects the alien to all the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to the same extent as if the status adjustment had not been made.</summary>
