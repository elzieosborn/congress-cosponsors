Extends the program's scope to atmospheric and biological sciences, food-borne diseases, corals, shellfish, and marine ecosystem and animal health predictive models.\n\nAuthorizes coordination with interagency working groups of the Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology, through the NSTC, to monitor and reduce marine public health problems, including climate change. Authorizes development of new technologies for detecting and reducing hazards to human health from ocean sources.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Commerce to establish an Oceans and Human Health Program to coordinate and implement research and activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n Revises the mission and scope of NOAA centers of excellence."
