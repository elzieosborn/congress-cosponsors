  <summary date="2012-01-11T18:21:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 - Expands the interagency oceans and human health research program established under the Oceans and Human Health Act to: (1) direct the President, through the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), to deliver information, products, and services to reduce public health risks and enhance health benefits from the ocean; and (2) include within the term "oceans" the Great Lakes and related coastal areas.

Directs the NSTC, through the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to submit to Congress, within 2 years after enactment of this Act and every 10 years thereafter, an update of the 2007 Interagency Oceans and Human Health Research Implementation Plan that defines the roles of specified federal agencies to avoid duplication of activities.

Adds monitoring, surveillance, forecasting, mitigation, prevention, and outreach goals to federal research priorities. Extends the program's scope to atmospheric and biological sciences, food-borne diseases, corals, shellfish, and marine ecosystem and animal health predictive models.

Authorizes coordination with interagency working groups of the Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology, through the NSTC, to monitor and reduce marine public health problems, including climate change. Authorizes development of new technologies for detecting and reducing hazards to human health from ocean sources.

Requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish an Oceans and Human Health Program to coordinate and implement research and activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

 Revises the mission and scope of NOAA centers of excellence.</summary>
