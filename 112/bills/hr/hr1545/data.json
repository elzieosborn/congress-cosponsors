Provides for the inclusion in such plan of opportunities for involvement by the University, the city, the state of Texas, and other local and national entities in the development of educational programs for the Monument and for the development and support of the Monument.\n\nProhibits the use of federal funding to pay the costs of: (1) carrying out a cooperative agreement under this Act, (2) acquiring land for inclusion in the Monument, (3) developing a visitor center, (4) operating or maintaining the Monument, (5) constructing exhibits, or (6) developing the general management plan.\n\nPermits the use of non-federal funding to pay any costs that may be incurred by the Secretary or the National Park Service (NPS) to carry out this Act.\n\nProhibits anything in this Act from affecting the eligibility of the Monument for federal grants or other financial assistance for which the Monument would have been eligible had System status not been conferred upon it.\n\nTerminates the designation of the Monument as a unit of the System if federal funding is required for the operation and maintenance of the Monument. Requires any land acquired by the Secretary from the city to revert to the city if such designation is terminated.\n\nProhibits any private property from being made a part of the Monument without the owner's written consent.\n\nProhibits anything in this Act, the establishment of such national monument, or the management plan from being construed as creating buffer zones outside of such monument.\n\nBars an activity or use that can be seen or heard from within the Monument from precluding the conduct of that activity or use outside the Monument."
