Public Transit Security and Local Law Enforcement Support Act - Amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to allow grants to eligible public transportation agencies for security improvements to be used for specialized patrol teams, including the sustainment of such teams without fiscal year limitation, as long as the agency applying for grant funds submits a sustainment plan for maintaining in future years the capability or capacity achieved with the funds.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2013. Prohibits more than 50% of such funds from being used for operational costs.</summary>
