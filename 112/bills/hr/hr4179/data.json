Directs the Secretary to make such reports public.\n\nAmends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 to include as a sanctionable activity the maintenance of funds or accounts for, or on behalf of, the Central Bank of Iran or another Iranian financial institution.\n\nApplies specified sanctions with respect to a foreign financial institution owned or controlled by the government of a foreign country (including a central bank of a foreign country) to the same extent and in the same manner as such sanctions apply to other foreign financial institutions.\n\nDirects the President to impose specified sanctions against a person that knowingly provided underwriting services or reinsurance: (1) for any activity regarding Iran for which sanctions have been imposed, or (2) to or for any person on which sanctions have been imposed for engaging in an activity with respect to Iran or any person designated for the imposition of sanctions in connection with Iran's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or support for international terrorism.\n\nIncludes among such sanctions export and procurement sanctions, and visa, property, banking, loan, and foreign exchange prohibitions."
