  <summary date="2012-09-20T16:33:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to revise the current requirement that the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) prepare an estimate for a bill or joint resolution of the cost which would be incurred in carrying out such legislation in the fiscal year in which it is to become effective and in each of the 4 ensuing fiscal years. Increases from 4 to 19 the number of ensuing fiscal years. (Thus requires 20-year instead of 5-year CBO cost estimates for legislation.)

Makes a conforming amendment to the Rules of the House of Representatives.</summary>
