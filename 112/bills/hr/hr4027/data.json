The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nAuthorizes Utah to relinquish for the benefit of the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation certain of its school trust or subsurface mineral lands south of the border between Grand County and Uintah County, Utah, in exchange for certain federal subsurface mineral lands north of that border.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Interior to reserve an overriding interest in that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act in the mineral lands conveyed to Utah. Delineates the extent of that interest.\n\nRequires Utah to reserve, for the benefit of its school trust, an overriding interest in that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act in the mineral lands it relinquished to the federal government. Delineates the extent of that interest.\n\nObligates neither the federal government nor Utah to lease or otherwise develop oil and gas resources in which the other party retains an overriding interest under this Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with Utah and the Tribe to facilitate the relinquishment and selection of the lands to be conveyed, and the administration of the overriding interests reserved under this Act. Terminates the overriding interests reserved by the Secretary and Utah 30 years after this Act's enactment."
