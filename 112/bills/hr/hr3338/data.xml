  <summary date="2011-11-29T20:18:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Outsourcing and Create American Jobs Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to develop and publish a list of countries that are tax havens for corporations.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the penalties on corporations for: (1) underpayment of tax involving an undisclosed foreign financial asset located in a tax haven country; (2) reportable transaction understatements involving transactions in a tax haven country; and (3) fraud, tax evasion, or false statements involving transactions in a tax haven country.

Grants a preference in the award of federal contracts to contractors who have not engaged in outsourcing. Defines "outsourcing" as the laying off of a U.S. worker from a job and the hiring or contracting for the same job to be performed in a foreign country.

Requires revenues generated by this Act to be set aside for the reduction of the public debt.</summary>
