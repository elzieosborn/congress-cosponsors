  <summary date="2012-04-17T20:40:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Grand Canyon Tourism Jobs Protection Act of 2012 - Declares that the substantial restoration of the natural quiet and experience of the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona shall be considered to be achieved in the Park if, for at least 75% of every day, half of the Park is free of sound produced by commercial air tour operations that have an allocation to conduct such tours in the Park.

Prohibits the Secretary from considering sound produced by sources other than commercial air tour operations when: (1) making recommendations, developing a final plan, or issuing regulations related to commercial air tour operations in the Park; or (2) determining whether substantial restoration of the natural quiet and experience of the Park has been achieved.

Requires the Secretary to continuously monitor noise from aircraft operating over the Park below 17,999 feet MSL to ensure compliance with such substantial restoration in the Park.</summary>
