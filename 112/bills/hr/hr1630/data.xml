  <summary date="2011-06-16T16:39:06Z" status="Introduced in House">Social Security and Medicare Protection Act - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget (or related measure) that would set forth a surplus for any fiscal year less than the combined surpluses of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for that fiscal year.

Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any (spending or tax) measure if its enactment would cause the surplus for any fiscal year covered by the most recently agreed to budget resolution to be less than such combined Fund surpluses.</summary>
