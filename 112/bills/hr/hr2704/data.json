    "text": "Justice for the Unprotected Against Sexually Transmitted Infections among the Confined and Exposed Act or the JUSTICE Act - Requires the Attorney General to direct the Bureau of Prisons to allow community organizations to distribute sexual barrier protection devices (e.g., condoms) and to engage in sexually transmitted infection (STI) counseling and prevention education in federal correctional facilities. Prohibits a federal correctional facility from taking adverse action against a prisoner who possesses or uses a sexual barrier protection device.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that states should allow for the legal distribution of sexual barrier protection devices in their correctional facilities.\n\nAmends the Social Security Act to provide for automatic reinstatement of Medicaid benefits for ex-offenders upon their release from a public institution if such an offender: (1) was enrolled under the state plan immediately before becoming an inmate of such institution, or (2) is diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus. Increases the federal matching payments made to a state by five percentage points for a one-year period to provide for such benefits.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to: (1) conduct a survey of all educational, testing, and other programs in federal and state correctional facilities for reducing the spread of STIs; and (2) develop and implement a five-year strategy to reduce the prevalence and spread of STIs in such facilities."
