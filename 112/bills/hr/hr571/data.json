Prescribes general requirements for the provision to a state of such an opportunity.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General periodically to review and assess: (1) whether state plans to develop and enforce safety and health standards are at least as effective as federal OSHA program standards in preventing occupational injuries, illnesses and deaths, and investigating discrimination complaints; (2) the effectiveness of the Secretary's oversight of such plans; and (3) the adequacy of the Secretary's investigations in response to Complaints About State Plan Administration (CASPA) as well as whether policy issues have been identified and corrective actions fully implemented by each state."
