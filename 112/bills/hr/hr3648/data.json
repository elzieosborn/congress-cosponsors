    "text": "Harbor Fairness Act of 2011 - Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to direct the Secretary of the Army to assess the total operation and maintenance needs of all harbors and inland harbors within the United States, including harbors used: (1) for commercial navigation, (2) for commercial fishing, (3) for subsistence, (4) as harbors of refuge, (5) for transportation of persons, (6) in relation to domestic energy production, (7) by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, and (8) for recreation purposes.\n\nDirects the Secretary, in conjunction with transmittal of the President's FY2013 budget and biennially thereafter, to submit to specified congressional committees a report on commercial navigation projects for such harbors that identifies: (1) the operation and maintenance costs associated with the projects; (2) the amount of funding requested in the President's budget for such costs on a project-by-project basis; (3) the unmet operation and maintenance needs associated with such projects; and (4) the harbors for which the President will allocate funding over the next five fiscal years for operation and maintenance activities on a project-by-project basis.\n\nDirects the Secretary: (1) to make expenditures to pay for harbor operation and maintenance costs based on an equitable allocation of funds among all such harbors, regardless of the size or tonnage throughput of the harbor; and (2) to allocate not less than 40% of the total expenditures in FY2013 and FY2014 to pay for operation and maintenance costs of moderate and low use harbors. Permits the Secretary, notwithstanding such requirements, to make an expenditure to pay for such costs of a specific harbor if the Secretary: (1) determines that such action is necessary to address the navigation needs of a harbor where safe navigation has been severely restricted due to an unforeseen event, and (2) provides advance notice on the need for such a determination to Congress."
