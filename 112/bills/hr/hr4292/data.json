Allows a recipient of an enhancement grant under such Program to use grant funds to standardize the technology architecture used by the recipient to comply with such standards.\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act to require states to ensure that databases established under the CS Program comply with such standards.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to report on enhancing the interoperability of state prescription monitoring programs with other technologies and databases used for detecting and reducing fraud, diversion, and abuse of prescription drugs."
