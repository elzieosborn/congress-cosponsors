    "text": "FEMA Reform Act of 2012 - Requires: (1) 50% of the amount estimated for a preliminary damage assessment by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for any state or local government to be released to such government not later than three days after such assessment is completed, and (2) hazard mitigation funding for a state under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to be disseminated within areas of the state in proportion to the damage of a major disaster in such areas.\n\nPermits the President, in addition to authorizing the repair, restoration, or replacement of federal facilities damaged by a major disaster, to make contributions to a state or local government to repair, restore, or replace vehicles and equipment, particularly those used for public safety, transportation, and service. Allows the actual cash value of such a vehicle or equipment that is more than 50% damaged to be used to replace it.\n\nAuthorizes the President to provide financial assistance under the Stafford Act to repair permanent structures, including rental units, necessary for temporary or transitional housing in areas affected by a major disaster.\n\nRequires: (1) FEMA to establish a recruiting and training office in a major disaster area as soon as possible to facilitate the hiring of local individuals to assist with public assistance applications for any major disaster that will require FEMA employees to be available in such area for an extended period; and (2) FEMA, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Department of Energy (DOE) to evaluate, complete, and publish a report outlining recommendations to public and private utilities, including electrical, water, sewer, and telecommunications, to reduce service interruptions during and after a hurricane."
