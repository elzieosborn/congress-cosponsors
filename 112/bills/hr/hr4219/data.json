Requires any homeownership counseling program under HUD auspices or administration to be provided only by organizations or counselors HUD-certified as competent to provide voluntary home inspection counseling. Authorizes HUD to withhold, withdraw, or suspend housing counseling certifications for any non-compliant housing counselor or counseling entity. Requires HUD to establish a comprehensive program to train HUD staff, contractors, individuals, and entities that provide housing counseling under specified HUD-funded programs also to provide counseling to consumers on voluntary home inspection. Requires such training program to include development of a training module to: (1) train counselors as well as counseling aids for use by housing counselors and suitable for distribution to consumers; and (2) be comprehensible to untrained consumers with or without ongoing assistance from housing counselors.\n\nRequires HUD, at the Secretary's discretion, to develop a new independent protocol, or amend existing protocols, to certify that such housing counselors have successfully completed training using the voluntary home inspection training module and counseling aids established under this Act."
