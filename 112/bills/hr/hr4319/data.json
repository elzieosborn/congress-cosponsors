    "text": "Calling Card Consumer Protection Act - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promulgate regulations requiring providers and distributors of prepaid calling cards, including cards using interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or a successor protocol, to accurately disclose applicable terms and conditions. Requires such disclosures to include: (1) the provider's name, customer service telephone number, and hours of service; (2) the card's number of minutes or dollar value; (3) per minute rates or a toll-free number to obtain rates; (4) fees and charges; (5) time period limits, any predetermined decrease in value over a period of time, and expiration dates; and (6) refund and recharge policies.\n\nRequires the accuracy of any information provided by a voice prompt relating to remaining card value and minutes.\n\nProhibits the FCC from specifying the rates, fees, additional charges, or terms and conditions of prepaid calling cards.\n\nDirects the FCC to implement and enforce this Act under the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nDirects the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to consult with the FCC with respect to any FTC rulemakings, regulations, or enforcement concerning prepaid calling cards.\n\nAuthorizes states or state-authorized consumer protection agencies to bring civil actions to enjoin or obtain damages or other relief for practices prohibited by this Act. Requires, with respect to any such state action, that the FCC be notified and permitted to intervene.\n\nProhibits states, during the pendency of any FCC-instituted action for an alleged violation of a regulation promulgated under this Act, from instituting an action under this Act for such alleged violations against any defendant named in the FCC complaint.\n\nPreempts state and political subdivision prepaid calling card disclosure laws, unless such requirements are identical to the regulations promulgated under this Act."
