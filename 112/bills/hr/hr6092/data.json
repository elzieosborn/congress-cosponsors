Makes time the firefighter is away from his or her official duty station assigned to an emergency incident, in support of an emergency incident, or pre-positioned for emergency response compensable as work time. Includes hazardous duty differentials as basic pay for retirement purposes.\n\nProhibits OPM from excluding wildland firefighters from federal employees' group life insurance (FEGLI) and from federal health care benefits."
