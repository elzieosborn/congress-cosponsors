    "text": "Solar Energy Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: (1) establish a program to provide competitive grants and/or challenge grants to\u00a0local governments that have adopted\u00a0best practices for solar permitting for properties located in the United States, (2) provide voluntary certification and recognition for such governments, and (3) implement specified criteria for awarding such grants.\n\nAuthorizes the use of funds for\u00a0competitive grants for: (1) training\u00a0and the development of materials and tools\u00a0for making the local permitting process for solar energy systems more standardized, efficient, and less expensive; and (2)\u00a0solar energy system deployment projects or programs to pilot new permitting strategies or processes. Authorizes the use of funds for challenge grants for: (1) solar energy system deployment projects, and (2)\u00a0programs to pilot new permitting strategies or processes.\n\nRequires the Secretary\u00a0to rescind grant funds provided to any grant recipient that receives funds based on a commitment to adopt best practices for solar permitting but that is unable to implement the steps necessary to adopt such practices.\n\nMakes each eligible entity receiving funds responsible for a matching amount not to exceed 50% of the funds provided."
