  <summary date="2011-10-21T19:14:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2011 - Amends the Presidential Records Act to require the Archivist of the United States, upon determining to make available any presidential record not previously made available publicly, to: (1) promptly provide written notice of such determination to the former President during whose term of office the record was created and to the incumbent President, and (2) make the notice available to the public.&#160; Requires a presidential record to be made available to the public 60 days after the Archivist gives notice, except any record with respect to which the Archivist receives notification from a former or incumbent President of a claim of constitutionally based privilege against disclosure.&#160;

Prohibits the Archivist from making a record that is subject to a privilege claim asserted by the incumbent President publicly available unless: (1) the incumbent President withdraws the claim; or (2) the Archivist is otherwise&#160;directed to do so&#160;by a final court order that is not subject to appeal.

Prohibits the Archivist from making available any original presidential records to anyone claiming access to them as a designated representative of a President or former President if that individual has been convicted of a crime relating to the review, removal, or destruction of the Archives' records.</summary>
