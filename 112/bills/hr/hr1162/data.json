Allows that land to be altered to allow for the relocation of Tribe members and structures outside the tsunami and Quillayute River flood zones.\n\nExtinguishes the Tribe's claims against the United States relating to the Park's past or present ownership, entry, use, surveys, or other activities upon the taking of the lands into trust for the Tribe and a formal Tribal Council resolution.\n\nProhibits gaming on lands taken into trust for the Tribe pursuant to this Act."
