  <summary date="2012-03-09T22:18:49Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on February 3, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Removes certain federal land within Olympic National Park, Washington, that is designated as part of the Olympic Wilderness from inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System.

 Takes specified federal land within the Park into trust for the Quileute Indian Tribe.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to take specified nonfederal land owned by the Tribe into trust for the Tribe, upon completion and acceptance of an environmental hazard assessment.

Includes those lands taken into trust for the Tribe in the Quileute Indian Reservation.

Subjects portions of the federal land conveyed to the Tribe to easements and conditions that preserve the natural condition of the land and provide the public with recreational access to the land and Park.

Exempts land conveyed to the Tribe along the southern boundary of the Reservation from any easements or conditions. Allows that land to be altered to allow for the relocation of Tribe members and structures outside the tsunami and Quillayute River flood zones.

Extinguishes the Tribe's claims against the United States relating to the Park's past or present ownership, entry, use, surveys, or other activities upon the taking of the lands into trust for the Tribe and a formal Tribal Council resolution.

Prohibits gaming on lands taken into trust for the Tribe pursuant to this Act.</summary>
