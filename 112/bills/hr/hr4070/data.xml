States that property of Iran shall be deemed to be property in the United States of Iran if that property is: (1) an interest, held for Iran's benefit or for the benefit of any securities intermediary that directly or indirectly holds the interest for Iran's benefit, in securities or other financial assets that are represented by certificates or are in other physical form and are immobilized, custodized, or held for safekeeping or any other reason in the United States; or (2) an interest in securities or other financial assets held in book entry form or otherwise, and credited to a securities account in the United States by any securities intermediary directly or indirectly for Iran's benefit or for the benefit of any other securities intermediary that directly or indirectly holds the interest for Iran's benefit.
