    "text": "Bring Jobs Back to America Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to create a comprehensive national manufacturing strategy to increase overall domestic manufacturing, create private sector jobs, identify emerging technologies, and identify a strategy for repatriating jobs to the United States. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish targets for manufacturing growth; (2) conduct biennial surveys of U.S. businesses that maintain manufacturing facilities or customer service centers outside the United States; and (3) report on survey results.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish multiple repatriation task forces to promote repatriation (return of a job or facility from a foreign country location to a U.S. location).\n\nEstablishes the American Economic Security Commission to establish and carry out a program to improve U.S. competitiveness in the global economy through technology-based planning.\n\nAmends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to make eligible for assistance under such Act projects to facilitate: (1) the relocation to the United States of a foreign source of employment; and (2) the growth of the U.S. manufacturing or customer service sector.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to study the feasibility and potential impact of new tax provisions to encourage U.S. companies to return jobs to the United States.\n\nAmends federal patent law to revise requirements regarding the publication of patent applications. Requires abstracts (short summaries of inventions) included with patent applications (instead of the patent applications themselves, as under current law) to be published 18 months after the earliest filing date of the application. Repeals certain requirements relating to: (1) submission of a redacted copy of an application; and (2) procedures to prevent protest and pre-issuance opposition to the grant of a patent.\n\nRequires the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to give priority to the examination of a patent application by an institution of higher education or a patent holding company affiliated with such an institution."
