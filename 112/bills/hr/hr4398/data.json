    "text": "Racial Profiling Prevention Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to make a grant to a state that: (1) has enacted and is enforcing a law that prohibits a state or local law enforcement officer from using the race or ethnicity (racial profiling) of the driver or passengers in making routine or spontaneous law enforcement decisions, such as ordinary traffic stops on federal-aid highways; and (2) allows and maintains public inspection statistical information for each motor vehicle stop made by a law enforcement officer on a federal-aid highway regarding the race and ethnicity of the driver and any passengers. Requires grant-receiving states to provide assurances to the Secretary that they are undertaking activities to comply with such requirements.\n\nRequires a state to use such grants for the costs of: (1) collecting, maintaining, and evaluating the results of data on traffic stops; and (2) activities to comply with the requirements of this Act.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this Act shall alter the manner in which a state or local law enforcement officer considers race or ethnicity whenever there is trustworthy information that links persons of a particular race or ethnicity to an identified criminal incident, scheme, or organization."
