Cutting Federal Unnecessary and Expensive Leasing Act of 2012 or the Cutting FUEL Act - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine: (1) the number of civilian vehicles purchased and leased by each executive agency in FY2010, (2) the total dollar amounts obligated by each agency to purchase and to lease civilian vehicles in FY2010, and (3) the amount that would be 20% less than those combined totals. Prohibits each agency from obligating more than such amount to purchase and lease civilian vehicles in each of FY2013-FY2017. Exempts the purchase or procurement of any vehicle determined by the President to be essential for reasons of national security.

Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to ensure that agencies may share excess or unused vehicles for temporary or long-term use through the Federal Fleet Management System.</summary>
