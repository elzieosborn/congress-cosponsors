    "text": "Safeguarding Access for Every Medicare Patient Act - Authorizes a covered entity to submit to a Patient Safety Organization information on electronic health record (EHR)-related adverse events with respect to certified EHR technology the entity has used or provided.\n\nSpecifies covered entities as certain EHR users, health information exchange entities, and health care professionals who use EHR technology.\n\nDefines an EHR-related adverse event as a defect, malfunction, or error in the certified health information technology or electronic health record used by a provider, or in the input or output of data maintained through such technology or record, that results or could reasonably result in harm to a patient.\n\nLimits electronic discovery (e-discovery) in any health care lawsuit against a covered entity relating to an EHR-related adverse event involving certified EHR technology to information: (1) related to that event, and (2) from the period in which the event occurred.\n\nProhibits a claimant from commencing a lawsuit more than three years after the manifestation of injury or one year after the claimant discovers, or should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. Requires tolling of this limitation, however, to the extent that the claimant is able to prove: (1) fraud; (2) intentional concealment; or (3) the presence of a foreign body, with no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the injured person.\n\nSubjects each party to such a lawsuit which is not a covered entity to proportionate liability only.\n\nAllows punitive damages against a covered entity only upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that the entity acted with reckless disregard for the claimant's health or safety.\n\nShields covered entities, employees, agents, and representatives from civil liability for libel or slander arising from information or entries made in certified EHR technology, or transferred to another eligible provider, if the information, entries, or transfer were made in good faith and without malice."
