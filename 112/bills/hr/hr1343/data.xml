  <summary date="2011-10-11T15:49:43Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 29, 2011. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

(Sec. 1) Requires the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service or the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to terminate for cause any award (including grants and loans) made under the Broadband Initiatives Program or the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, respectively, established pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, if the Administrator or Assistant Secretary determines that cause exists (including insufficient level of performance, wasteful spending, or fraudulent spending) to terminate the award.

Directs the Administrator or the Assistant Secretary to: (1) deobligate, upon terminating such an award, an amount equivalent to such award, less allowable costs, to the extent funds with respect to such award are available in the account relating to the respective programs (requires that any additional amount subsequently recovered be deobligated immediately upon receipt); and (2) return to the Treasury's general fund such deobligated amounts and any award returned or disclaimed by a recipient after enactment of this Act.

(Sec. 3) Requires the Administrator or the Assistant Secretary, upon receiving information from the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Inspector General of the Department of Commerce, or the Comptroller General pertaining to material noncompliance with award terms or improper usage of award funds, to: (1) review such information immediately, (2) determine whether cause exists to terminate such award (unless the relevant official recommends that such a determination not be made), and (3) notify Congress of any such determination.</summary>
