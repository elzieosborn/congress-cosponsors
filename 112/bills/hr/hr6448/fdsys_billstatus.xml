    <constitutionalAuthorityStatementText><![CDATA[<pre>From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [<a href='http://www.gpo.gov'>www.gpo.gov</a>]By Mr. PRICE of North Carolina:H.R. 6448.Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuantto the following:Congressional power to provide for public financing ofpresidential campaigns arises under the General WelfareClause, Art. I, Sec. 8, of the Constitution. In Buckley v.Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 91 (1976), the Supreme Court upheld thecongressional power to enact public financing of presidentialelections under this Clause. The Supreme Court stated withregard to the provisions in the Federal Election Campaign ActAmendments of 1974 establishing a presidential publicfinancing system, ``In this case, Congress was legislatingfor the `general welfare'--to reduce the deleteriousinfluence of large contributions on our political process, tofacilitate communication by candidates with the electorate,and to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising.''[Page H6232]</pre>]]></constitutionalAuthorityStatementText>
