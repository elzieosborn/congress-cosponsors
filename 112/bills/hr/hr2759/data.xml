  <summary date="2011-11-29T22:18:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Business Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) forced labor, slavery, human trafficking and the worst forms of child labor are among the most egregious forms of abuse in the name of commercial profit; (2) the legislative and regulatory framework to prevent goods produced through forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor from passing into the stream of commerce is gravely inadequate; and (3) legislation is necessary to provide the information that the public demands, recognizing that businesses can provide information and respond to consumer and investor demands for business reasons, rather than solely reacting to governmental prescriptions on how to conduct their business.

Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to promulgate regulations requiring mandatory annual reports to disclose measures taken during the year to identify and address conditions of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor within the supply chains of the business entity.

Requires any business entity filing such disclosures to make them available on its Internet website.</summary>
