Limits the amount paid to a customer under this election to the customer's net equity claims against the debtor.\n\nCaps at $500,000 the amount of a one-time payment the SIPC can make under this election.\n\nSubrogates SIPC to all rights of the customer against the debtor, regardless of whether the one-time payment was in an amount to fully satisfy the customer's claims against the debtor.\n\nTreats a certificate of deposit (CD) purchased by a person through an account with the debtor as cash deposited and held by the debtor in an amount equal to the amount the person paid for the CD, less any amounts paid to such person on the CD."
