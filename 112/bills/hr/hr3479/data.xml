  <summary date="2012-11-20T22:10:57Z" status="Reported to House amended, Part I">Natural Hazards Risk Reduction Act of 2011 - Title I: Earthquakes - National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2011 - (Sec. 103) Amends the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 to revise the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and to authorize appropriations to carry out such Program for FY2012-FY2014. States that the Program shall be administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Includes among Program activities: (1) researching and developing effective methods, tools, and technologies to reduce the risk posed by earthquakes to the built environment; and (2) supporting public education and outreach to assist different populations, including individuals and households with special needs, in preparing for and responding to earthquake-related disasters.

 Includes among NIST's Program responsibilities issuing recommendations to assist in the development of model building codes. Requires USGS to operate a Global Seismographic Network (currently, a National Seismic System). Repeals provisions requiring NIST to develop a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research.

Revises provisions concerning the Advisory Committee on Earthquake Hazards Reduction and requires it to offer assessments on: (1) trends and developments in the natural, social, and engineering sciences and practices of earthquake hazards impact mitigation; and (2) the priorities of the Program's strategic plan.

(Sec. 104) Requires USGS to utilize the coordination expertise of the lead Program agency to organize investigations to study the implications of an earthquake in the areas of responsibility of each Program agency.

Title II: Wind - National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2011 - (Sec. 203) Amends the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 to revise the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program and to authorize appropriations to carry out such Program for FY2012-FY2014. Designates NIST as the lead agency. Eliminates provisions providing for establishment of an Interagency Working Group and sets forth revised responsibilities of NIST and the other Program agencies: FEMA, NSF, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

(Sec. 204) Revises provisions concerning establishment of an Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, which shall offer assessments on: (1) trends and developments in the natural, social, and engineering sciences and practices of windstorm impact mitigation; and (2) the priorities of the Program's strategic plan.

Title III: Interagency Coordination - (Sec. 301) Replaces provisions establishing an Interagency Coordinating Committee on Earthquake Hazards Reduction with provisions establishing an Interagency Coordinating Committee on Natural Hazards Risk Reduction, which shall oversee the planning and coordination of the Earthquake and Windstorm Programs and make proposals for planning and coordination of other federal research for natural hazard mitigation. Requires such Committee to develop and submit strategic plans, progress reports, and coordinated budgets for both such Programs.

(Sec. 302) Requires the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources of the National Science and Technology Council to submit a report on federal research, development, and technology transfer activities that address hazard mitigation for natural disasters.

Title IV: Fire Research Program - (Sec. 401) Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to include within authorized fire research scientific investigations into the early stages of, and the behavior of, fires at the wildland-urban interface that are the result of natural causes.</summary>
