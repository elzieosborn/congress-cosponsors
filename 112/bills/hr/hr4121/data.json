Requires the Administrator to identify appropriate federal procurement contracts for award under the program.\n\nAllows a contracting officer to award: (1) a sole source contract under the program if an entity is determined to be a responsible contractor and the officer does not reasonably expect that two or more early stage businesses will submit offers, and (2) contracts on the basis of competition restricted to early stage businesses if the officer reasonably expects that at least two early stage businesses will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair market price.\n\nRequires all program contract awards to be counted toward goals for small business participation in federal procurement contracts."
