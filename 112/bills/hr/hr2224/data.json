Excepts from this reduction requirement a hospital: (1) located in a rural area with fewer than 250 beds, or (2) that has had in effect a voluntary residency reduction plan.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase the otherwise applicable resident limit (create additional residency slots) for applicant hospitals according to a specified formula that takes into account the aggregate reduction in limits attributable to this Act.\n\nExpands the primary care bonus to certain underserved specialties, such as psychiatry or neurology.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a small physician practice residency credit."
