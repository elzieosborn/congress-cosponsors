    "text": "Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing Act of 2011 or COVERT Act of 2011 - Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to make sure that advance notice of a covert test of a transportation security system is not provided to any individual (including any security screener) before completion of the test, except: (1) that such information may be provided to certain federal, state, and local government employees, officers, and contractors (including military personnel); and (2) an individual conducting such a test may disclose his or her status if a security screener or other non-covered employee identifies such tester as a potential threat.\n\nRequires the head of each covert testing office to make sure that a covert testing person or group is accompanied by a cover team to monitor the test and confirm the identity of personnel involved. States, however, that a cover team is not required to be present during a test of the screening of persons or baggage at an aviation security checkpoint if the test: (1) is approved by the Federal Security Director for the airport, and (2) is administered under a DHS aviation screening assessment program.\n\nDirects the Secretary to study the impact of implementing covert testing procedures under this Act on DHS efforts to improve transportation security."
