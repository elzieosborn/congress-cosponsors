Prohibits the Secretary from prohibiting a member from returning to the United States due to any screening result or determination.\n\nRequires the Secretary and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a joint protocol to share existing and future reports from confidential screenings conducted to help aid members in their transition from health care and treatment provided by the Department of Defense (DOD) to health care and treatment provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)."
