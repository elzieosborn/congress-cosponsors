Requires states to give priority for payments to eligible employers who hire or rehire a disconnected youth.\n\nRequires the Secretary to make allotments and grants to states to carry out eligible on-the-job training programs for disconnected youth.\n\nDirects the President to establish a public service employment program to employ individuals to carry out works of a public nature in connection with parks, roads, schools, and after-school programs. Requires priority for such jobs to be given to individuals who are disconnected, low-income, and long-term unemployed youth.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) extend the work opportunity tax credit through calendar 2016, (2) include as a member of a targeted group for purposes of such credit a qualified Title 1-B youth services recipient and rename a \"qualified ex-felon\" as a \"qualified ex-offender\" for purposes of the credit, (3) double the amount of allowable wages that may be considered in calculating such credit, (4) extend the designation period for tax-preferred empowerment zones, and (5) allow an employer tax credit through 2013 for the employment of disconnected youth.\n\nRequires the Secretary of the Interior to give preference to the hiring of individuals age 16 to 21 for federal park and forestry jobs.\n\nAuthorizes contracting officers of executive agencies to give preference in the award of federal contracts for the procurement of goods and services to employers: (1) that employ, in a youth apprenticeship and in the performance of the contract, disconnected youth who reside in high unemployment areas; and (2) whose contracts are funded for FY2012 under a law enacted to create infrastructure, transportation, or green energy jobs."
