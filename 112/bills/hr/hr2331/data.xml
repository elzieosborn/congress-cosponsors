  <summary date="2011-07-08T15:50:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Prepare All Kids Act of 2011 - Creates a part I (High Quality Full-Day Prekindergarten Programs) under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Implements such part by requiring the Secretary of Education to establish a Prekindergarten Incentive Fund from which matching grants shall be awarded to states and, through them, subgrants to qualified prekindergarten providers to establish, expand, or enhance voluntary high quality full-day prekindergarten programs serving children ages 3-5.

Directs state grantees to set aside: (1) at least 15% of their grant for quality early childhood development programs for children ages 0-3, and (2) at least 10% of their grant to extend the hours of early childhood programs to create extended day and year programs.

Requires prekindergarten subgrantees to: (1) maintain a maximum class size of 20 children, with at least 1 prekindergarten teacher per classroom; and (2) ensure that the ratio of children to prekindergarten teachers and teacher aides does not exceed 10 to 1.</summary>
