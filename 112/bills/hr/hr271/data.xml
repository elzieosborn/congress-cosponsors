Establishes in the Treasury a revolving fund for such program. Requires the Secretary to: (1) deposit amounts received as payment on loans provided under such program into such revolving fund; and (2) make available $100 million of the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to such revolving fund.</summary>
