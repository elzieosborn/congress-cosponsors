  <summary date="2012-07-05T16:26:35Z" status="Passed House amended">York River Wild and Scenic River Study Act of 2012 - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a specified segment of the York River in Maine and all of its associated tributaries for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to complete a study of, and submit a report to Congress on, the York River.

Requires such study to: (1) determine the designation's effect on existing commercial and recreational activities, the construction and operation of energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the authority of state and local governments to manage those activities; and (2) identify all authorities that will authorize or require the Secretary to influence local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on non-federal land if designated under this Act, all authorities that the Secretary may use to condemn property, and all private property located in the area studied pursuant to this Act.</summary>
