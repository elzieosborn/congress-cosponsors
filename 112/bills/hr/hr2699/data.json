Subjects any Peace Corps volunteer or member who breaches a duty of confidentiality regarding such a report to disciplinary action, including termination.\n\nRequires the Director to enter into with the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, and requires the Inspector of the Peace Corps to review, a memorandum of understanding that specifies the duties and obligations of the Peace Corps and the Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security regarding the protection of Peace Corps volunteers and staff members serving in foreign countries. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of Peace Corps funds for volunteers' invitations for service or to deploy trainees overseas if such agreement has not entered into force within nine months after enactment of this Act, unless the Director certifies that: (1) significant progress is being made toward finalizing such memorandum, and (2) the Peace Corps is using best efforts to provide volunteers with the training, support, and information they need to stay safe.\n\nExempts such Inspector General and officers and employees of the Inspector General's Office from certain length of appointment, reappointment, and reassignment limitations applicable to the Foreign Service.\n\nRequires the Director to: (1) annually submit a report on the safety of Peace Corps volunteers; and (2) perform, at least once every three years, a review to evaluate the allocation and delivery of resources across the countries the Peace Corps serves.\n\nRequires the Inspector General to perform an audit every five years of Peace Corps implementation of safety and security protocols."
