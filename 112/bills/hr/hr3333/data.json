Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to and contract with qualified non-profit or other community-based service providers to perform the assistance.\n\nAmends the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to make an exception to the five-year limited eligibility of qualified aliens for federal means-tested public benefits for individuals who have obtained special immigrant juvenile status.\n\nMakes a similar exception for such individuals with respect to the limited eligibility of qualified aliens for certain Federal programs."
