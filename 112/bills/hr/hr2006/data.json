Requires the Secretary to: (1) act as the primary federal official with responsibility for overseeing all NIH research on autism spectrum disorders; (2) approve the autism spectrum disorder research strategic plan developed by the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee and be responsible for its implementation; (3) receive directly from the President and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) all funds available for autism spectrum disorder activities of NIH; (4) allocate such funds in accordance with the strategic plan; (5) allocate amounts within 30 days after receipt, to the extent practicable; (6) have authority to reallocate up to 3% of the total amount allocated as needs change and opportunities arise; (7) plan and evaluate NIH research and other activities related to autism spectrum disorders; (8) maintain communications with all relevant federal departments and agencies to ensure the timely transmission of information concerning autism spectrum disorders; and (9) carry out this Act in consultations with the heads of NIH agencies and their advisory councils and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. Terminates such provisions seven years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\nExpands authorized research for centers of excellence for autism spectrum disorders to include translational research. Requires the Director of NIH to provide for a program under which biosamples relevant to environmental exposures that are of use in research on autism spectrum disorders are donated, collected, preserved, and made available for such research."
