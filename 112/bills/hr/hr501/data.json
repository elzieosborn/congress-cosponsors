    "text": "Implementing the Recommendations of the BP Oil Spill Commission Act of 2011 - Establishes in the Department of the Interior: (1) a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to administer a program of offshore energy and mineral resources management on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS); (2) a Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to administer safety and environmental enforcement activities related to such resources; (3) a National Oil and Gas Health and Safety Academy to train Department of the Interior personnel; and (4) an Office of Natural Resources Revenue to administer offshore royalty and revenue management functions. Abolishes the Minerals Management Service and transfers specified functions to such Bureaus and Office.\n\nRequires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) certify compliance with federal employee ethics laws annually; and (2) establish an Outer Continental Shelf Safety and Environmental Advisory Board to advise the Secretary and the Directors of such Bureaus on safe and environmentally compliant energy and mineral resource exploration, development, and production activities.\n\nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 2011 - Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, including by: (1) establishing and revising regulations to provide for operational safety and the protection of the marine and coastal environment of OCS natural resources; (2) setting forth minimum requirements for regulatory standards for blowout preventers, well design, and cementing; (3) requiring the Secretary to review the minimum financial responsibility requirements for leases by May 11, 2011, and every five years thereafter; (4) limiting an oil and gas lease of submerged OCS lands to a tract of 5,760 acres; (5) requiring geological exploration permits to include environmental and natural resource conservation requirements; (6) increasing civil penalties for violations; (7) directing the Secretary to require that lessees obtain a permit prior to any significant modification of a well design; (8) requiring lessees to submit development and production plans for oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico; (9) revoking provisions concerning royalty relief for oil and gas leases in the Planning Areas offshore Alaska; (10) requiring the President to publish a final determination of the boundaries of coastal states projected seaward to the outer margin of the OCS; and (11) prohibiting the Secretary from issuing any license or permit authorizing drilling for oil and gas on the OCS unless the applicant has an approved response plan.
