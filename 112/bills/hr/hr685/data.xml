  <summary date="2011-03-23T20:59:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Checkpoint Images Protection Act of 2011 - Amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to one year on any individual who knowingly: (1) photographs or otherwise records an image produced using advanced imaging technology during the screening of an individual at an airport or upon entry into any building owned or operated by the federal government without express authorization pursuant to a federal law or regulation, or (2) distributes such image to any individual who is not authorized pursuant to a federal law or regulation to receive it.&#160;

Exempts individuals who, within the scope of their employment, record or distribute an image solely to be used in a criminal investigation or prosecution or in an investigation relating to foreign intelligence or a threat to the national security.

Directs the Assistant Secretary, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to certify that, in order to improve airport security screening processes while ensuring passenger privacy protection, the image retention capabilities of all advanced imaging technology utilized by TSA to screen passengers at checkpoints in our nation's airports have been disabled.</summary>
