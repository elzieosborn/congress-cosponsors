  <summary date="2011-08-30T18:42:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2011 - Directs the President to promulgate regulations to ensure that aviation fuel, motor vehicle fuel, home heating oil, and boiler fuel sold or introduced into commerce in the United States, on an annual average basis, contains the applicable volume of clean coal-derived fuel, determined in accordance with this Act.

Exempts small refineries from compliance with such regulations until calendar year 2020.

Directs the Secretary of Energy to study whether compliance with the requirements of this Act would impose a disproportionate economic hardship upon small refineries. Requires the President to extend such exemption for a maximum of two additional years if such compliance would impose a disproportionate economic hardship upon small refineries.

Allows a small refinery to: (1) petition the President for an exemption at any time for the reason of disproportionate economic hardship; and (2) opt-in and be subject to such regulations if it notifies the President that it waives the exemption.</summary>
