  <summary date="2011-01-12T19:06:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Heat Island and Smog Reduction Act of 2011 - Requires each federal agency, by April 1, 2012, to develop a heat island reduction plan for all federal property and facilities under its possession or control that are located in an area designated under the Clean Air Act as being in nonattainment with national ambient air quality standards for ozone. Requires each plan to include measures to: (1) maximize tree cover on federal property; and (2) increase solar reflectivity through techniques such as using roofs with high solar reflectivity (cool roofs), vegetated roofs, and paving materials with higher solar reflectivity.

Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to submit annual reports to specified congressional committees assessing agency progress in developing and implementing such plans.</summary>
