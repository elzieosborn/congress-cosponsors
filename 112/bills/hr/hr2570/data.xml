Requires each military industrial facility of the military departments and defense agencies (other than facilities approved for closure or major realignment under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990) to be designated as a Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence in the recognized core competencies of the designee.</summary>
