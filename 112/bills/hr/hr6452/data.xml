  <summary date="2012-11-09T19:24:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Prohibits amounts from being obligated or expended for any direct U.S. assistance, loan guarantee, or debt relief to Libya, Egypt, Pakistan, or a host country of a U.S. diplomatic facility that was attacked, trespassed upon, breached, or attempted to be attacked, trespassed upon, or breached, on or after September 1, 2012. Authorizes the President to request that the prohibition be suspended with respect to a country if the President certifies to Congress that: (1) such country is cooperating with investigations into an attack, has arrested or extradited persons associated with the attack, and is improving local security; and (2) all persons associated with the attack have been identified by U.S. law enforcement and are in U.S. custody.

Prohibits any request with respect to Pakistan until: (1) Dr. Shakil Afridi has been released alive from prison; (2) all charges brought against Dr. Afridi have been dropped; and (3) if necessary to ensure his freedom, Dr. Afridi has been allowed to leave Pakistan alive.

Requires the President to report to Congress regarding the extent to which advanced weaponry remaining unsecured after the fall of Moammar Qaddafi was used by the individuals responsible for the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as an authorization for the use of military force.</summary>
