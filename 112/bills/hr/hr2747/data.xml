  <summary date="2011-10-26T21:16:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Cancer Centers Assistance for Renovations and Expansion Act of 2011 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a program that provides loans to qualifying cancer centers for payment of the capital costs of projects for the improvement of research, prevention, or patient care infrastructure.

Sets the maximum amount of such loans at: (1) $50 million for any cancer center or comprehensive cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, and (2) $100 million for any entity that is a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center and a cancer hospital meeting certain requirements for a subsection (d) hospital.

(Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system [IPPS] when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)</summary>
