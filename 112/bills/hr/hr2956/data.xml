  <summary date="2011-11-10T16:07:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Fair and Equitable Postal Service Access Act - Expands the criteria that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) must consider in determining whether to close or consolidate a post office to include: (1) whether such closing or consolidation will decrease access to postal or nonpostal services by individuals who are elderly, economically disadvantaged, limited in mobility, or without reliable and affordable Internet access; and (2) during the previous five years, the number of, and revenue derived from, money-order transactions, the volume of processed international mail, and the number of customers served at such post office.

Prohibits the USPS from closing or consolidating a post office if it would result in a disproportionate, unreasonable, or undue burden on a class of individuals who are elderly, economically disadvantaged, limited in mobility, or without reliable and affordable Internet access.

Applies this Act to any post office: (1) determined necessary for closing or consolidation under existing criteria, or (2) included in a proposal to change the nature of postal services on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis and for which the USPS has requested a related advisory opinion from the Postal Regulatory Commission.</summary>
