(Replacement of regulatory, warning, and post-mounted guide [except street name] signs is required by January 22, 2015. Replacement of street name signs and overhead guide signs is required by January 22, 2018.)\n\nRepeals the requirement that the Secretary revise the Manual to include a federal standard for a minimum level of retroreflectivity for pavement markings and signs on all public roads."
