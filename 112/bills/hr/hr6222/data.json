    "text": "Clean Heating Oil Act of 2012 - Amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit, effective June 1, 2016, any person from manufacturing, selling, supplying, offering for sale or supply, dispensing, transporting, or introducing into commerce heating oil which contains a concentration of sulfur in excess of: (1) 15 parts per million, or (2) a lesser concentration that may be established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (but not below the concentration of sulfur in diesel fuel permissible under renewable fuel standards) to ensure that such concentration is not reasonably anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare.\n\nAllows the Administrator to: (1) provide for the issuance of credits to refiners and importers for amounts of heating oil manufactured or imported before June 1, 2016, in accordance with such limitation; and (2) allow a refiner or importer to use such credits, or transfer such credits to another refiner or importer for use, for the purpose of complying with this Act. Terminates such credits on June 1, 2019.\n\nDefines \"heating oil\" to mean any number 1 distillate, number 2 dyed distillate, or non-petroleum diesel blend that is: (1) sold for use in furnaces, boilers, stationary diesel engines, or similar applications; and (2) commonly or commercially known or sold as heating oil or fuel oil or using a similar trade name.\n\nAllows the Administrator to: (1) temporarily waive the requirements of this Act if the Administrator determines, and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) concurs, that the criteria for fuels and fuel additives is met with respect to heating oil; and (2) waive requirements of this Act with respect to any heating oil manufactured by a small refinery until June 1, 2019.\n\n Applies penalty and injunction provisions for violations of fuel regulations under the Clean Air Act to violations of this Act."
