Requires any establishment engaged in manufacturing and packaging cosmetics for use in the United States to register annually and pay a fee for oversight and enforcement of this Act.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish labeling requirements; (2) establish a safety standard that provides a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to a cosmetic or an ingredient in a cosmetic and that protects the public from any known or anticipated adverse health effects associated with the cosmetic or ingredient; and (3) issue guidance prescribing good manufacturing practices for cosmetics and ingredients.

Requires manufacturers of cosmetics and ingredients to submit to the Secretary safety data for the ingredients listed on the cosmetic label and the cosmetic itself, which shall be published in a database.

Requires the Secretary to review and evaluate the safety of cosmetics and ingredients of cosmetics that are marketed in interstate commerce, including nanotechnology and contaminants.

Requires the Secretary, based on an initial review and evaluation, to establish three lists for ingredients: (1) a prohibited and restricted list, (2) a safe without limits list, and (3) a priority assessment list.

Authorizes the Secretary to order a recall or cease of distribution for a cosmetic that is adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of the FFDCA.

 Requires reporting of adverse health effects associated with cosmetics.

Requires the Secretary to take action to minimize the use of animal testing of ingredients and cosmetics.

Establishes an Interagency Council on Cosmetic Safety.

Requires the Secretary of Labor to promulgate an occupational safety and health standard relating to cosmetics for professional use.</summary>
