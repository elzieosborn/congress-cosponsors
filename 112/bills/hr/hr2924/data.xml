  <summary date="2011-12-13T19:48:17Z" status="Introduced in House">414 Plan Act of 2011 - Declares that federal laws and regulations (including prevailing rate of wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act) shall not apply to any federal-aid highway or highway safety construction project, except those relating to: (1) the safety or durability of a highway facility, or (2) public or workplace safety.

Repeals the prohibition against approval of federal-aid highway projects or regulatory actions that will result in the severance of an existing major route or have significant adverse impact on the safety for nonmotorized transportation traffic and light motorcycles, unless the project or action provides for a reasonable alternative route or such a route exists.

Repeals also: (1) the reservation of certain allocations of funds for transportation enhancement activities, and (2) authorization for states to use certain funds for construction of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities.

Eliminates the requirement that statewide transportation plans and statewide transportation improvement programs provide for the development of accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities.

Expresses the sense of Congress that states, federal agencies, localities, and private stakeholders should take steps toward increased cooperation to further expedite surface transportation projects.</summary>
