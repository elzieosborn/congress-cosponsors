Limits extension coverage to applications filed within 30 months preceding the enactment of this Act.\n\nReduces such extended period by six months per year over a five-year period, beginning on October 1, 2013.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to maintain the Office of Generic Drugs as a separate office within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
