Directs the Secretary to make such notifications within: (1) 5 business days, or (2) 10 business days if the Secretary determines that providing earlier notification is not feasible due to circumstances necessary to accurately identify the individuals whose sensitive personal information is involved in the data breach or to prevent further breach or unauthorized disclosure and reasonably restore the integrity of the data system.\n\nRequires such notification, in writing or by email or other electronic means, to include: (1) a description of the sensitive personal information involved in the breach, (2) a telephone number that the individual may use to contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), (3) notice that the individual is entitled to receive certain credit protection services at no cost to such individual, (4) the toll-free contact telephone numbers and addresses for the major credit reporting agencies, and (5) a toll-free telephone number and website address where the individual may obtain identity theft information.\n\n Directs the VA's Office of Public Affairs to notify the general public concerning any data breach involving sensitive personal information within five working days or as soon as possible pursuant to specified exceptions."
