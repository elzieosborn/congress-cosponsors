  <summary date="2011-05-04T20:06:17Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2011 - Enacts into law the provisions of H.R. 1 (Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011), as passed by the House on February 19, 2011, if the House has not received a message from the Senate before April 6, 2011, stating that it has passed a measure providing for the appropriations for the federal departments and agencies for the remainder of FY2011.

Prohibits the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, respectively, from disbursing to each Member or Delegate the amount of his or her salary for each day that: (1) there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations for any federal agency or department for failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution, or (2) the federal government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit has been reached.

Imposes the same restrictions on the President with respect to receiving a disbursement of basic pay during such period.</summary>
