Provides that New Columbia shall consist of all territory of the District as of the enactment of this Act, excluding land within specified metes and bounds that shall remain the District of Columbia and that shall include the principal federal monuments, the White House, the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court Building, the federal executive, legislative, and judicial office buildings located adjacent to the Mall and the Capitol Building, and certain military property.

Prohibits New Columbia from imposing taxes on federal property except as provided by Congress.

Maintains the applicability to New Columbia of current District laws and continues pending judicial proceedings.
