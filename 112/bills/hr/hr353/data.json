Requires such an entity to: (1) utilize mobile screening units to test for glaucoma and other eye diseases; (2) target screening activities to populations primarily consisting of high-risk individuals; (3) form partnerships with federally-qualified health centers to increase awareness of the need for glaucoma screenings and to provide screenings for high-risk individuals; and (4) provide grants to approved medical residency training programs to permit participating students to conduct such screenings."
