    "text": "Review Every Dollar Act of 2011 - Makes it out of order in both chambers to consider any bill, joint resolution, or other measure that: (1) reauthorizes any federal program for more than seven fiscal years, or (2) establishes a new federal program that exceeds such period.\n\nRequires each standing congressional committee with legislative jurisdiction over any direct spending program by July 31 during the second session of each Congress to apply specified criteria to determine whether any such program should be modified, terminated, or reauthorized.\n\nAmends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require each of the chairs of the congressional budget committees to maintain a deficit reduction discretionary account and a deficit reduction direct spending account. Prescribes procedures for the crediting to such accounts of the amounts of either discretionary or direct spending deficit reduction in any amendment to a bill that reduces the appropriate budget authority.\n\nRequires any measure or Act that transfers funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to be counted as new budget authority and outlays equal to the amount of the transfer in the fiscal year in which it occurs.\n\nAmends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to eliminate the authorization of appropriations and the appropriation of additional Pell Grant funds after FY2012 that were to be used to increase the maximum Pell Grant amount. Maintains the amount of a Pell Grant at $5,500 for academic years 2013-2014 through 2017-2018, minus the expected family contribution.\n\nAmends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) with respect to adjustments to discretionary spending limits for the budget year and each outyear to reflect changes in concepts. Defines changing a program from direct spending to discretionary spending or from discretionary spending to direct spending as such a change of concept, if it does not cause a net increase in new budget authority or outlays for FY2012-FY2021.\n\nProhibits from taking effect, except according to a specified procedure, any rule made to carry out a direct spending program that would require new budget authority of at least $100 million for the fiscal year it takes effect or for any of the nine ensuing fiscal years. Limits exceptions to this prohibition to rules necessary: (1) because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, or for national security; or (2) to implement an international trade agreement. Requires also for such an exception that the new budget authority to carry it out is provided by law.\n\nRequires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) review proposed rules requiring new budget authority before their effective dates, and (2) take specified administrative steps to prevent further agency action pertaining to such rulemaking."
