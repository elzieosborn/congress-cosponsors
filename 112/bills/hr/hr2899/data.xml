  <summary date="2011-11-04T16:04:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Chinese Media Reciprocity Act of 2011 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to limit the number of I-visas (foreign media) issued to state-controlled media workers from China to the number of visas issued by China to U.S. nationals who are employees of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) and who seek to enter China solely to engage in such vocation.

Requires revocation of a sufficient number of I-visas issued to Chinese state media workers in order to reach parity with the number of visas issued by China for BBG employees seeking entry to China.</summary>
