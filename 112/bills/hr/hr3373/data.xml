  <summary date="2011-11-17T21:12:20Z" status="Introduced in House">STEM Education Innovation Act of 2011 - Amends the Department of Education Organization Act to establish the Office of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education within the Department of Education to administer STEM education.

Directs the Office of STEM Education to conduct an independent evaluation of the Department's STEM Education programs at least once every five years.

Establishes an Education Innovation Project within the Department to pursue breakthrough research and development in educational technology, and facilitate the effective use of that technology to improve student achievement.

Directs the Office of STEM Education to award competitive matching grants to consortia of state-based STEM stakeholders that enable each of them to establish a state consortium on STEM education.

Require each consortium to: (1) promote STEM education research and best practices; (2) address deficiencies in state STEM education efforts and communicate state needs to the federal government; (3) support the implementation of rigorous common content standards in mathematics and science education, and the development of innovative STEM assessments based on those standards; (4) promote and develop curriculum tools and training for in-service STEM teachers; (5) develop STEM Career Awareness Programs; and (6) develop STEM-related workforce education and training programs.</summary>
