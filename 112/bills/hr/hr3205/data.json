Deems the review permissible if the Secretary does not object within 60 days.\n\nRequires the Secretary to provide for the initial training and periodic updating of training of accredited persons.\n\nMakes accreditation valid for three years. Sets forth provisions regarding reaccreditation.\n\nProhibits an accredited person from being a sole practitioner. Provides that the prohibitions against an accredited person being owned or controlled by a manufacturer, supplier, or vendor of devices or engaging in the design, manufacture, promotion, or sale of devices shall apply only if the devices are of the same type for which the person is accredited."
