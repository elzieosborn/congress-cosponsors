    "text": "American-Made Energy Act of 2011 - Establishes in the Treasury the American-Made Energy Trust Fund for alternative and renewable energy incentives and projects (e.g., wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal resources, waste to energy, hydropower, nuclear power, coal to liquid technology, compressed natural gas, and liquified natural gas).\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Interior to establish, implement, and administer a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound program for the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas resources of the Coastal Plain of Alaska.\n\nRepeals the prohibition against production or leasing of oil and gas resources from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).\n\nDeclares that the oil and gas leasing programs and activities in the Coastal Plain authorized by this Act are deemed to be compatible\u00a0 with the purposes for which ANWR was established.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to designate up to a total of 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as a Special Area requiring special management and regulatory protection after consultation with Alaska, Kaktovik, and the North Slope Borough. Requires the Secretary to designate the\u00a0Sadlerochit Spring area as a Special Area. Permits horizontal drilling technology in such Areas from sites on leases outside such Areas.\n\nPrescribes guidelines for implementation of lease sales.\n\n Requires the Secretary to administer this Act to: (1) ensure that oil and gas production activities on the Coastal Plain will have no significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their habitat, and the environment; (2) require the application of the best commercially available technology for oil and gas exploration, development, and production operations, and (3) minimize the amount of surface acreage covered by production and support facilities. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1)\u00a0compliance with environmental requirements, (2) expedited judicial review, and (3) distribution of revenues.\n\nDirects the Secretary to issue rights-of-way and easements across the Coastal Plain for the transportation of oil and gas.\n\nEstablishes in the Treasury the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund to assist local governments in mitigating\u00a0the potential effects of oil and gas exploration and development in their communities and to establish a coordination office by the North Slope Borough in Kaktovik.\n\nTerminates all existing federal laws prohibiting expenditures to conduct oil and natural gas leasing and preleasing activities in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Revokes withdrawals of federal submerged lands of the OCS from leasing."
