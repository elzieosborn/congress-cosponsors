    "text": "Everson Walls and Ron Springs Gift for Life Act of 2011 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to establish a National Organ and Tissue Donor Registry Resource Center, which shall: (1) advance the development, expansion, and evaluation of state organ and tissue donor registries; (2) facilitate timely access to, and the exchange of accurate donor information between, such registries; (3) ensure that registries funded through this Act comply with applicable requirements; (4) provide technical assistance to states for such registries; and (5) maintain a registry information clearinghouse to collect, synthesize, and disseminate best practices information.\n\nRequires the Secretary to award grants or cooperative agreements to states for the development, enhancement, expansion, and evaluation of organ and tissue donor registries. Sets forth requirements for registries, including that such registries: (1) allow a donor to include a statement or symbol that the donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; (2) allow organ procurement organizations to access that information, at or near the donor's death; and (3) bar the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information for any other purpose without the donor's consent.\n\nProhibits any person from being held civilly liable for having harvested or taken an individual's organs or tissues without obtaining valid consent if: (1) such person verified that the individual was registered as a donor with a state organ and tissue donor registry, and (2) the harvesting or taking was within the scope of the consent given for purposes of such registration.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to report on the feasibility of establishing a living donor database to track health effects for donors associated with living organ donation."
