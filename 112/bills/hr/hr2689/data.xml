  <summary date="2011-08-29T20:25:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Abuse for Every Teen Act or SAFE Teen Act - Amends title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include dating violence prevention among the drug and violence prevention efforts funded under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program.

Authorizes local educational agencies (LEAs) to use program funds for peer support groups that provide an emotionally safe and confidential setting for youth to learn and practice healthy relationship skills under the supervision of school personnel or community organizations specializing in domestic and sexual violence prevention. Allows perpetrators of dating violence to participate in such groups, but not in the same groups as victims of such violence.

Authorizes the Secretary of Education to use program funds to: (1) develop and disseminate innovative and high-quality healthy relationship skill-building programs as a way to reduce unhealthy or abusive teen relationships; and (2) disseminate information on dating violence education and prevention, and data on the incidence of dating violence in the school environment and relevant behavioral indicators of exposure to violence.

Directs the Secretary to collect and publicly disseminate among individuals aged 11-19 data on the incidence of dating violence, sexual violence, emotional abuse, and relevant behavioral indicators of exposure to such types of violence.

Requires states to provide technical assistance to LEAs and schools in their efforts to prevent and appropriately respond to incidents of dating violence.

Directs the Secretary to establish the Innovation Fund to replicate, refine, and test model strategies and projects to prevent and respond to dating violence for youth.</summary>
