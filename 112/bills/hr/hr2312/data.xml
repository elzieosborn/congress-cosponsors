  <summary date="2011-08-12T21:31:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Department of Defense Textile and Apparel Procurement Fairness Act - Prohibits the Secretary of Defense from purchasing a textile or apparel product (an individual end item purchased by Department of Defense [DOD] or an item with an individual National Stock Number) for which Federal Prison Industries has a market share determined by the Secretary to be greater than 5% of the DOD market for the product.

Prohibits Federal Prison Industries from: (1) submitting a DOD contract offer for any textile or apparel product reserved for small businesses; and (2) continuing to perform under a contract for a textile or apparel product under its preference, as specified, if, after receiving the award, the work intended to be done by federal prisoners is subsequently subcontracted to another entity.

Directs the DOD, upon reducing the quantity of items to be delivered under any indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract for any such product, to reduce Federal Prison Industries' share of the contract by the same percentage that the industry's share is reduced.</summary>
