  <summary date="2011-05-16T18:08:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice Integrity Act of 2011 - Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish a pilot program in 10 U.S. districts to promote fairness and the perception of fairness in the federal criminal justice system and to determine whether legislation is required, and (2) designate a U.S. attorney in each of the districts to implement a plan for carrying out such pilot program.

Requires each U.S. attorney designated to implement a pilot program to appoint an advisory group consisting of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and other individuals and entities who play an important role in the criminal justice system. Requires each advisory group to: (1) collect and analyze data on the race and ethnicity of defendants at each stage of a criminal proceeding, (2) seek to determine causes of racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice process, and (3) submit to the U.S. attorney a report and proposed plan for addressing such disparities. Requires each U.S. attorney to annually evaluate the efficacy of a plan submitted by an advisory group.

Requires the Attorney General to: (1) prepare a comprehensive report on all advisory group plans and submit such report and plans to Congress, and (2) exercise continuing oversight of the criminal justice system to reduce unwarranted racial and ethnic disparities and improve such system.</summary>
