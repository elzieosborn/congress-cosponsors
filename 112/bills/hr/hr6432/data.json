    "text": "Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act of 2012 - Amends federal patent law to implement the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs and the Patent Law Treaty. (Both treaties were ratified by the Senate on December 7, 2007.)\n\nAllows any person who is a U.S. national, or has a domicile, habitual residence, or real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the United States, to file an international design application for international registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (thereby enabling U.S. applicants to file a single application with USPTO instead of separate applications in multiple countries).\n\n Directs the USPTO to transmit international fees and forward international design applications to the international intergovernmental coordinating body.\n\nRequires an international design application on an industrial design made in the United States to constitute the filing of an application in a foreign country if such application is filed: (1) in a country other than the United States, (2) at the international intergovernmental coordinating body recognized under the Hague Agreement, or (3) with an intergovernmental organization.\n\nSets forth the priorities of national and prior foreign and national applications.\n\nStandardizes application procedures to be consistent with other member countries.\n\nExtends the term for design patents from 14 to 15 years from the date of grant."
