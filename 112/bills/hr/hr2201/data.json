Requires such adjustments in order to make the state average per beneficiary amount equal to the national average per beneficiary amount.\n\nDirects the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to develop recommendations on policies and practices that would encourage: (1) healthy outcomes and quality care under the Medicare program in states with respect to which payments are reduced under such system, and (2) the efficient use of payments made under the Medicare program in such states."
