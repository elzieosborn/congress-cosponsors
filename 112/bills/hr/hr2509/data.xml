  <summary date="2011-09-27T20:58:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Preserving Consumer's Mortgage Origination Choices Act of 2011 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to provide that no provision of TILA shall be construed as prohibiting a mortgage broker from compensating a mortgage originator based on the principal amount of the loan, when compensation is paid directly or indirectly to the mortgage broker by the consumer in connection with such transaction.

Authorizes a mortgage originator, when requested by a borrower as the originator is producing a mortgage, to forfeit or contribute toward bona fide third party expenses or origination fees up to 30% of earned compensation to avoid making a high-cost mortgage to a consumer, to make technical corrections, or for any other reason that results in a lower cost to the consumer than if such forfeiture or contribution did not take place.</summary>
