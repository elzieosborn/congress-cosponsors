  <summary date="2011-03-29T15:35:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Bed Bug Management, Prevention, and Research Act - Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to: (1) award grants for bed bug management and eradication, (2) appoint a bed bug task force, and (3) award grants for related research projects.

 Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to include bed bugs in the definition of "vector."

 Requires the submission and evaluation of efficacy data if a pesticide is labeled for or proposed to be labeled for the control of a public health pest. Prohibits the sale or distribution of any product that is marketed, distributed, or sold with a claim that such product will control a public health pest if the submitted data does not support such claim.

Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to award grants through September 30, 2017, to three state agencies for a pilot program under which state subdivisions and housing authorities use such funds to supplement ongoing bed bug prevention and mitigation activities. (Requires at least one of the three grants to be awarded to a state agency that before November 1, 2009, submitted a public health exemption request which proposed a pesticide use to control bed bugs but which was voluntarily canceled.)</summary>
