Prohibits Congress from passing any bill that provides a net reduction in individual income taxes for those with incomes over $1 million (as may be adjusted by Congress to account for inflation) if, after enactment, total outlays would exceed total receipts in any fiscal year affected by the bill. Prohibits a federal or state court from ordering any reduction in the Social Security benefits authorized by law, including any benefits provided from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, or either of their successor funds."
