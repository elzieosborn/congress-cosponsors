  <summary date="2011-02-02T19:30:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends rule XXII (Precedence of Motions) of the Standing Rules of the Senate with respect to cloture votes to close debate (end a filibuster) on any measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate.

Declares that, if the Senate fails to invoke cloture with respect to a measure, motion, or other pending matter, or the unfinished business, subsequent motions to end debate on the same measure, motion, matter, or unfinished business, may be filed, but only by unanimous consent, until the previous motion has been disposed of.

States that the affirmative vote on a subsequent motion to close debate on any measure, motion, or other matter, or unfinished business (other than a measure or motion to amend Senate rules) shall be reduced by three votes on the second such motion, and by three additional votes on each succeeding motion, until the affirmative vote is reduced to a number equal to or less than an affirmative vote of a majority of the Senators duly chosen and sworn. Declares that the required vote shall then be an affirmative vote of a majority of such Senators. Prohibits any further reduction in the requirement of an affirmative vote of a majority of Senators upon any vote taken on any later motion to close debate on the same measure, motion, matter, or unfinished business.

Authorizes the Majority and Minority Leaders, after debate has concluded under the rule (cloture) but before final disposition of the pending matter, each to offer up to three leadership amendments if they have been timely filed and are germane to the matter being amended. Limits debate on a leadership amendment to one hour equally divided. Prohibits division of such amendments.</summary>
