Applauds the efforts of conference attendees to discuss and explore the increased role of nuclear power plant life management in support of license renewal and the safe, long-term operation of commercial nuclear reactors throughout the world.

Thanks the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for organizing the Third International Conference on Nuclear Power Plant Life Management in the United States for the first time, and encourages member states of the IAEA to take advantage of the latest available technology to further develop licensing programs, promote safety, and secure the long-term success of commercial nuclear power generation.</summary>
