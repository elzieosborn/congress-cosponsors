  <summary date="2011-02-25T16:53:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) in cases dealing with perceived threats to authorities the Russian judiciary is frequently used as an instrument of the Kremlin; (2) Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are political prisoners who have been denied due process rights under international law; (3) in light of the record of selective prosecution, politicization, and abuse of process involved in their cases, the 2010 conviction against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev should be overturned; and (4) the government of Russia is encouraged to take these actions to further a more positive relationship between the governments and people of the United States and Russia.</summary>
