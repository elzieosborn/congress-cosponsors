  <summary date="2012-07-11T21:36:44Z" status="Reported to Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Condemns Iran for its systemic violations of the human rights of the Iranian people, including the state-sponsored persecution of religious minorities in Iran, and its continued failure to uphold its international obligations, including with respect to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Calls on Iran to exonerate and release Youcef Nadarkhani and all other individuals held or charged on account of their religious or political beliefs. Calls on the Administration to designate Iranian officials for human rights abuses.

 Reaffirms that freedom of religious practice is a universal human right and a fundamental individual freedom that every government must protect.</summary>
