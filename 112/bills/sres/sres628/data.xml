  <summary date="2013-01-07T21:50:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Affirms that all children deserve a permanent, protective family.

 Values the long tradition of the United States and Russia working together to find permanent homes for unparented children.

 Disapproves of the Russian law ending inter-country adoptions of Russian children by U.S. citizens because it primarily harms vulnerable and voiceless children.

 Urges Russia to reconsider the law on humanitarian grounds and prioritize the processing of inter-country adoptions of Russian children by U.S. citizens that were initiated before the law's enactment.</summary>
