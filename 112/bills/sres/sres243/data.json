The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nCalls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to work with leaders in the medical community to explore ways to improve medical research, screening and prevention methods, and surveillance efforts to prevent and manage atrial fibrillation, including by: (1) advancing the development of process and outcome measures for the management of atrial fibrillation by national developers; (2) facilitating the adoption of evidence-based guidelines by the medical community to improve patient outcomes; (3) advancing atrial fibrillation research and education by encouraging basic science research to determine causes and optimal treatments, exploring development of screening tools and protocols to determine the risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and enhancing current surveillance and tracking systems to include atrial fibrillation; and (4) improving access to appropriate medical care for patients suffering from atrial fibrillation by encouraging education programs that promote collaboration among federal health agencies and that increase public and clinician awareness."
