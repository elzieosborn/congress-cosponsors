  <summary date="2012-12-27T20:47:22Z" status="Passed Senate amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on September 19, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Condemns the international abduction of all children.

Urges countries identified by the Department of State as noncompliant or demonstrating patterns of noncompliance with the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction to fulfill their commitment to implement the Convention. Calls on all countries: (1) to become a party to the Convention and institute measures to address cases of international parental child abduction, and (2) that have not become a party to the Convention to develop a mechanism for the resolution of cases of international parental child abduction that occur prior to becoming a party to the Convention.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should: (1) pursue the return of each child abducted by a parent from the United States to another country through all appropriate means, facilitate access by the left-behind parent if the child is not returned, and, where appropriate, seek the extradition of the abductor parent; (2) take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child abducted to a Convention country is returned to the child's country of habitual residence; (3) use diplomacy to encourage other countries to become a party to the Convention and to encourage countries that have not become a party to the Convention to develop a mechanism to resolve cases of international child abduction that occur prior to becoming a party to the Convention; and (4) review the advisory services made available to U.S. citizens by the Department of State, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other U.S. government agencies to improve the prevention of such child abduction from the United States, and to ensure that effective assistance is provided to U.S. citizen parents of such abducted children.</summary>
