  <summary date="2011-04-04T19:56:11Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the nation's economy and security depend upon full and immediate restoration of shallow and deepwater drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico, and (2) the long-term economic health of Alaska depends upon the responsible development of the oil and natural gas reserves of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.

Urges the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) streamline the review and approval of applications for both shallow and deepwater drilling permits in the Outer Continental Shelf, (2) take immediate action to provide the shallow and deepwater industry with a completed sample application meeting all new safety and environmental regulations, (3) supply written guidance and clarification to applicants regarding new safety requirements, and (4) give permit applicants timely and detailed explanations on any areas of a permit which do not satisfy new requirements.</summary>
