  <summary date="2011-07-07T19:47:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are prisoners who have been denied basic due process rights under international law and the laws of the Russian Federation for political reasons; (2) the Russian Federation's standing as a nation supporting democracy, freedom of expression, an independent judiciary, human rights, and the rule of law would be validated by overturning the convictions of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev and securing their immediate release; and (3) the Russian Federation is encouraged to take these actions in furtherance of a new and more positive relationship between the United States and Russia.</summary>
