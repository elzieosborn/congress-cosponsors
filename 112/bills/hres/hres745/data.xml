  <summary date="2012-09-19T17:59:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Condemns the growing repression of democracy and human rights in Ecuador, including the suppression of freedom of expression and increased government control over the judiciary.

Calls on the Secretary of State to: (1) note in the 2012 and future Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Ecuador the limited ability to report on the full account of human rights abuses in Ecuador due to a lack of transparency within government institutions in that country; and (2) provide to the relevant Senate and House committees a budget and performance review of Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) activities in Ecuador funded to promote strong democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights.

Expresses concern regarding: (1) the lack of high-level counternarcotics cooperation between the United States and Ecuador, (2) aspects of Ecuador's actions that fail to meet the intentions of the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) and the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, and (3) the expanded relationship between Ecuador and Iran.

Declares that the House of Representatives is not inclined to support a renewal of ATPA for Ecuador based on the current status of such concerns. Calls for a careful review of such concerns, in addition to Ecuador's eligibility as a beneficiary country, when considering renewal of ATPA, which expires on July 31, 2013.</summary>
