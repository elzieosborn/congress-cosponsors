Security Council to condemn the recent spike in Gaza-linked terrorist missile attacks against Israel.\n\nEncourages the President to continue to work diplomatically with the international community to prevent Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist organizations from retaining or rebuilding the capability to launch rockets and missiles against Israel."
