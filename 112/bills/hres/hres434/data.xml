  <summary date="2011-11-15T19:34:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Celebrates the 10-year commemoration of the Underground Railroad Memorial, comprised of the Gateway to Freedom Monument in Detroit, Michigan, and the Tower of Freedom Monument in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

Supports the designation of an International Freedom Corridor and the nomination of the Detroit River as an International World Heritage Site.

Recognizes that a National Park Service (NPS) special resource study may establish national significance, suitability, and feasibility of a National Freedom Corridor.

Acknowledges that the National Heritage Areas and Corridors are examples of recognitions that do not involve establishing a new unit of the National Park System, and for which the role of the NPS is primarily to assist state and local initiatives to preserve resources.</summary>
