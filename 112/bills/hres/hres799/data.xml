  <summary date="2012-11-06T17:59:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Affirms that it is U.S. policy to provide for the ability of members of the uniformed services to exercise their constitutional right to vote and acknowledges that particular consideration be given to them due to restrictions, uncertainties, and risks, such as deployment, that present a challenge in voting.

Recognizes the legislative and judicial precedent of granting particular consideration to members of the uniformed services and overseas citizens regarding absentee voting.

Affirms that while the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against arbitrary classifications, and requires that similarly situated persons be treated equally, members of the uniformed services and overseas citizens are not similarly situated, and that the restrictions, uncertainties, and risks that members of the uniformed services face warrant consideration that is not arbitrary.</summary>
