        <text>The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate and waives all points of order against consideration of the measures. The rule provides one motion to recommit H.R. 1216 with or without instructions. The rule also provides that after general debate on H.R. 1540, the Committee of the Whole shall rise without motion and that no further consideration of the bill shall occur except pursuant to a subsequent order of the House. The rule provides that after general debate on H.R. 1216 the measure shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule and shall be considered as read. The rule makes in orderonly those amendments that are received for printing in the Congressional Record dated May 23, 2011, and pro forma amendments for the purpose of debate. The rule waives clause 6(a) of rule XIII (requiring a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee) against any resolution reported from the Rules Committee providing for consideration or disposition of a measure addressing expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Requthorization Act of 2005, through the legislative day of May 27, 2011.</text>
