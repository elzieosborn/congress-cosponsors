  <summary date="2011-08-09T20:53:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Disapproves of the majority opinion in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., because it puts prescribers at risk of having their prescriber-identifying information sold without their knowledge or consent.

Expresses the belief of the House of Representatives that: (1) the Supreme Court incorrectly applied a heightened First Amendment standard of review to an instance of commercial regulation; (2) the negative impact on a pharmaceutical manufacturer's ability to market its products is outweighed by the interests of patient safety, doctor privacy, and health care costs; and (3) the states have the right to regulate the pharmaceutical industry based on what is best for the health and safety of their residents.</summary>
