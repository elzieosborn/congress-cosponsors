  <summary date="2012-06-23T14:13:44Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) Americans rely on coal and the inexpensive energy it provides for nearly half of our energy needs; (2) the proposed rule entitled "Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units" will likely lead to increased energy costs, resulting in the loss of American jobs, making American businesses less competitive, and damaging our nation's economic recovery; and (3) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should not be setting energy policy with environmental regulations that dictate fuel choices for new power plants.</summary>
