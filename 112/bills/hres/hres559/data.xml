Calls on the Secretary of State to withhold assistance to Egypt if the U.S. citizens are not released.

Calls on Egypt to comply with international human rights standards.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that U.S. assistance for Egypt should not be allocated if the government of Egypt continues to retain U.S. and other foreign citizens and work against the pursuit of democracy.</summary>
