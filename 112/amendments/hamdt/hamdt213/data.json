  "number": 213,
  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 4 printed in House Report 112-46 to exempt Hawaii's large and medium hub airports from collecting PFCs from interisland travelers due to the unique everyday travel circumstances the island state presents. Would also change the formula under which Hawaii's annual federal apportionments are reduced when the State's large and medium hub airports collect passenger facility charges from overseas travelers.",
