  "number": 1494,
  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 12 printed in House Report 112-680 to give power to the states to revoke any existing federal implementation plan (FIP) with regard to the regulation of visibility. In revoking the FIP, the state must propose a state implementation plan (SIP) to regulate visibility within 2 years. The Amendment also gives the states a minimum of five years to become compliant with federal standards if they choose to accept the FIP, allowing businesses time to plan for the changes.",
