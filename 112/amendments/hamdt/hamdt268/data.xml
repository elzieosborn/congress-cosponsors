  <description>Amendment sought to strike provisions in the bill that would "deem" the safety and environmental review done in 2007, prior to the BP spill, sufficient for new offshore oil and gas leasing. The amendment would have allowed lease sales to go forward, but would require new environmental and safety reviews for the period following the BP spill.</description>
