  <description>Manager's amendment changes the underlying bill's requirement that the Department of the Interior substitute two new lease blocks for each one lease block that is deferred from a lease sale at the request of the Department of Defense; to replace each deferred lease block with one new lease block; calls attention to the existing authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for the President to designate National Defense Areas on the outer Continental Shelf that are restricted from exploration and operation; and also requires the North Aleutian Basin lease sale to be conducted by 2015 rather than one year after enactment of the Act.</description>
