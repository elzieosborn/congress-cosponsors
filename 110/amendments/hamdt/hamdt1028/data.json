  "description": "Amendment struck section 708 of the substitute amendment (maritime biometric identification) and replaced it with a requirement that the Commandant of the Coast Guard, within one year of enactment, conduct a program for the mobile biometric identification of suspected individuals, including terrorists, to enhance border security. It also required a cost analysis of expanding these capabilities to other Coast Guard and DHS vessels. The analysis may include a plan to give priority to vessels and units more likely to encounter those suspected of making illegal border crossings through the maritime environment.",
