The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nCalls the world's attention to the serious degradation of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea.\n\n Applauds the cooperative manner with which the governments of Israel and Jordan, as well as the Palestinian Authority (PA) have worked to address the declining water level and quality of the Dead Sea and other water-related challenges in the region.\n\n Supports efforts to assess the environmental, social, health, and economic impacts, costs, and feasibility of a Red Sea-Dead Sea pipeline in comparison to alternative proposals.\n\n Encourages Israel and Jordan, as well as the PA, to continue to work in a spirit of cooperation as they address the region's serious water challenges.\n\n Urges Israel, Jordan, and the PA to develop a comprehensive strategy to rectify the Jordan River's degradation.\n\nExpresses hopes that the spirit of cooperation manifested in the search for a solution to the Dead Sea water crisis might serve as a model for addressing the degradation of the Jordan River, as well as a model of peace and cooperation for the upcoming meetings in Washington between Israel and the PA."
