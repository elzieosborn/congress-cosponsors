Expresses the the sense of the Senate that: (1) U.S. diplomats serving overseas and in the United States are in many cases the front line of our national security policy; (2) the people of the United States deserve a better understanding of the efforts of these brave men and women; (3) talented young people and their families should be encouraged to consider foreign affairs careers as an important contribution to their country; (4) the establishment of a Museum of the History of American Diplomacy that highlights the work of these men and women throughout U.S. history is a worthy endeavor; and (5) the Foreign Affairs Museum Council's plan to fund the museum through private donations deserves Department of State support.</summary>
