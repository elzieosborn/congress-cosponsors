Urges the Dalai Lama or his representatives and the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to begin negotiations for a solution that addresses the legitimate grievances of, and provides genuine autonomy for, the Tibetan people.

 Affirms that the human rights of Tibetans and their right to practice religion free of government regulation is not an internal matter of any one country.

 Calls on the U.S. government to press the PRC to: (1) respect freedom of speech and freedom of association and to release those who have committed no crime other than peaceful protest; and (2) allow Tibetans to practice their religion freely.</summary>
