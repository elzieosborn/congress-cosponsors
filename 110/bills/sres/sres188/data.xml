Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) Israel shares the commitment of the United States to, and the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) foundational principles of, good government, free markets, and democratic values; (2) Israel meets the OECD membership criteria, and is well deserving of membership; and (3) it is in the U.S. interest to support Israel's accession to the Convention on the OECD, and the United States should advocate for such accession before and during the OECD ministerial meeting in May 2007.</summary>
