Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States remains committed to the people of Somalia and to helping build the institutions necessary for a stable and peaceful nation; and (2) the President, in partnership with the African Union, the United Nations, and the international community, should provide humanitarian assistance, ensure accountability for parties responsible for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Somalia, and call on all parties to recommit to an inclusive dialogue to promote peace and security in Somalia and across the Horn of Africa.

 Urges the governments of Ethiopia and of Eritrea to assist in helping to bring about stability to Somalia.

States that the Transitional Federal government should: (1) take necessary steps to protect civilians from dangers related to military operations; (2) recommit to the Transitional Federal Charter; and (3) agree to participate in an inclusive political process towards the formation of a government of national unity based on the principles of democracy, accountability, and the rule of law.</summary>
