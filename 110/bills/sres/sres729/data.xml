  <summary date="2009-01-31T15:43:45Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal entitled "Prevention of Significant Deterioration New Source Review: Refinement of Increment Modeling Procedures" and urges that the rule be withdrawn.

Finds that EPA has proposed multiple changes to the PSD program that would conflict with Congress's statutory scheme to preserve, protect, and enhance air quality in national parks, wilderness areas, monuments, and seashores, and in other areas of special natural, recreational, scenic, or historic value.</summary>
