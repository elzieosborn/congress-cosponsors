  <summary date="2008-10-15T20:45:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Encourages the Air Force to quickly recompete the KC-X (aerial refueling aircraft) solicitation on terms the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended in its June 18, 2008, decision.

Recognizes that a rapid, thorough, and fair recompetition is the best means to provide the Air Force with next-generation aerial refueling tanker capability in a timely manner.

Recognizes that such solicitation is the first of a three-phased strategy for recapitalizing the tanker fleet, and that it should be based on a full and transparent competition to select a single aircraft design.

Supports the GAO recommendation that the Air Force reopen discussions with the offerors, obtain and reevaluate revised proposals, and make a new source selection decision.</summary>
