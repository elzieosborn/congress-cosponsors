Expresses strongly to the government of Lithuania that the cemetery located in the Snipiskes area of Vilnius, Lithuania, an important part of the cultural heritage of the Jewish people, should not be further desecrated.

 Urges Lithuania to take all necessary steps to immediately stop, and if necessary reverse, construction on that cemetery.

 Reaffirms that constructive bilateral relations between Lithuania and the United States are important to the governments and citizens of both countries.

 Expresses strong support for the work of the United States Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad and for the European countries that continue to work to preserve sacred historical sites.</summary>
