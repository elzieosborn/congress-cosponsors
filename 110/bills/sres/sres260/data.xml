  <summary date="2007-07-26T20:38:46Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Permits a point of order to be made by any Senator against any item contained in a conference report that includes or consists of any matter not committed to the conferees by either chamber.

 Declares that the point of order may be made and disposed of separately for each item in violation of this resolution.

Provides for disposition of such point of order.

States that the term "matter not committed to the conferees by either chamber" includes items which consist of specific provisions containing specific levels of funding for specific accounts, specific programs, specific projects, or specific activities, when no such specific funding was provided in the original measure committed to the conferees by either chamber.

Applies the same meaning to the term under Rule XXVIII (Conference committees, reports, open meetings) of the Standing Rules of the Senate.

Permits waiver or suspension of such requirements, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate.</summary>
