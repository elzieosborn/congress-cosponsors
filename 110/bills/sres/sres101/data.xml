  <summary date="2007-04-09T21:42:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Declares that: (1) neither the President nor Congress should take any action that will endanger U.S. Armed Forces, including eliminating or reducing funds for troops in the field or failing to provide them adequate training, equipment, and other support; and (2) the President, Congress, and the nation have an obligation to ensure that those who have served this country in time of war receive the health care and other support services they deserve.

States that the President and Congress should: (1) continue to exercise their constitutional responsibilities to ensure that the Armed Forces have everything they need to perform their assigned or future missions; and (2) review, assess, and adjust U.S. policy and funding to ensure that U.S. troops have the best chance for success in Iraq and elsewhere.</summary>
