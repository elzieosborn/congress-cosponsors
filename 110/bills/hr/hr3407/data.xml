  <summary date="2007-10-24T19:51:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to allow states to allocate school improvement funds under title I of the ESEA for coordinated, early intervention services for all students. Includes among such services, schoolwide positive behavior support, defined as a broad range of systemic and individualized strategies for achieving important social and learning outcomes while preventing problem behavior with all students.

Requires improvements in schoolwide learning climates, including schoolwide positive behavior supports, to be a target of: (1) technical assistance provided by states to local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools, and by LEAs to schools identified as needing improvement; (2) schoolwide programs that allow LEAs to consolidate educational funds to upgrade the entire educational program of schools that serve a high proportion of low-income families; (3) funding under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program; (4) elementary and secondary school counseling programs; and (5) professional development funding.

Amends the Department of Education Organization Act to establish, within the Department of Education, an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services to oversee and implement the provision of specialized instructional support services in schools by school counselors, social workers, psychologists, and other qualified professionals.</summary>
