Requires a participating employer to ensure that each eligible employee has an opportunity to enroll in a plan.

Sets forth requirements for health plans offered under this Act. Requires the Administrator to contract with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to study the rating requirements that apply to health insurance purchased in the small group markets in the states and to develop recommendations concerning rating requirements.

Sets forth premium-setting rules for plans under this Act.

Allows a state to prohibit participation in this program if the state offers alternative health benefit plans.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for small employers for qualified employee health insurance expenses under this Act.</summary>
