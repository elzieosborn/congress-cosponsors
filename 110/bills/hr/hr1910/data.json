Lists those with standing.\n\nProhibits executive agencies and the Armed Forces from entering into procurement contracts for sweatshop goods.\n\nProhibits anything in this Act from being construed to preempt a state from regulating labor standards required in the mining, production, or manufacture of merchandise purchased by the state."
