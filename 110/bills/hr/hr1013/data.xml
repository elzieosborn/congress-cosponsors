  <summary date="2007-02-20T21:19:39Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (SCHIP) of the Social Security Act to revise the prohibition against approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of any waiver, experimental, pilot, or demonstration project that allows funds made available under SCHIP to be used to provide child health assistance or other health benefits coverage to a nonpregnant childless adult.

Repeals the limitation of such prohibition with respect to childless nonpregnant adults, and the exclusion of caretaker relatives from consideration as childless adults denied such assistance or other health benefits coverage. (Thus extends such prohibition to the use of such funds for assistance to or coverage of all nonpregnant adults, regardless of whether they do or do not have children, or whether they are caretaker relatives.)

Terminates all such coverage under current waivers as of December 31, 2007.</summary>
