Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation each to submit an annual report to Congress describing actions taken with respect to the preservation and expansion of minority depository institutions.

Amends the Home Owners' Loan Act to repeal its (redundant) requirement that the OTS Director report annually to Congress on actions taken with respect to the preservation and expansion of minority depository institutions.</summary>
