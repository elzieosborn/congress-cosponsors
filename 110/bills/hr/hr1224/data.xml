Directs the Secretary of Education to identify model state and local physical education programs, evaluate their safety and effectiveness, and publish information on such programs.

Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to states to: (1) establish or revise physical education standards; (2) develop assessment tools; (3) establish or revise physical education curricula to meet minimum content and performance standards established by the Secretary; and (4) support the development of model programs.
