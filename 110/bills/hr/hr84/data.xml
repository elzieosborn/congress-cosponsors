  <summary date="2007-01-09T21:15:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Energy Efficient Buildings Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish a pilot program to award grants to businesses and organizations for new construction or major renovations of energy efficient buildings that will result in innovative energy efficiency technologies, especially those sponsored by the Department of Energy; and (2) give due consideration to proposals for buildings that are likely to serve low and moderate income populations.

Defines "energy efficient building" as one that after construction or renovation: (1) uses heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems that perform at no less than Energy Star standards; or (2) if Energy Star standards are not applicable, uses Federal Energy Management Program recommended heating, ventilating, and air conditioning products.</summary>
