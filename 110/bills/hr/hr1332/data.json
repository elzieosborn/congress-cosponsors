Requires the quarterly adjustment of any contributions made.\n\n(Sec. 102) Directs the Administrator to carry out a rural lending outreach program to provide up to an 85 percent guaranty for loans of $250,000 or less made by lenders to small businesses in rural areas. Requires the SBA to approve or decline such loan within 36 hours.\n\n(Sec. 103) Directs the Administrator to carry out a permanent Community Express Program (currently a pilot program) for loans of $250,000 or less to small businesses: (1) whose majority ownership is held by women, members of qualified Indian tribes, socially or economically disadvantaged individuals, veterans, or members of the reserves; or (2) located in a low- or moderate-income area. Requires the SBA to approve or decline such loans within 36 hours.\n\n(Sec. 104) Requires the Administrator to carry out a Medical Professionals in Designated Shortage Areas Program to provide loans to small businesses that provide medical, dental, or psychiatric services and are located in a health professional shortage area (as defined under the Public Health Service Act). Directs the SBA to guarantee 90 percent of such loan, and reduces by half the borrower and lender fees.\n\n(Sec. 105) Directs the Administrator to carry out an Increased Veteran Participation Program to small businesses whose majority ownership is held by veterans or members of the reserves.
