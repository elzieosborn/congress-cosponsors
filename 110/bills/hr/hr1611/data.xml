Requires the SBA Administrator to establish, for each industry classification, a maximum level of net worth for an economically disadvantaged individual (for purposes of eligibility for the contract award program). Prohibits the Administrator from establishing a maximum net worth that prohibits program entry of less than $750,000.</summary>
