  <summary date="2007-03-15T21:30:59Z" status="Introduced in House">Agricultural Export Facilitation Act of 2007 - Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSREEA of 2000) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize, under a general license, certain travel-related transactions for travel to, from, or within Cuba in connection with: (1) sales and marketing activities, including organization and participation in product exhibitions; and (2) sea or air transportation of products.

Authorizes a consular official to issue a temporary tourist/business visa for a Cuban national (who is not otherwise inadmissible) whose itinerary documents an intent to conduct activities, including phytosanitary inspections, related to purchasing U.S. agricultural goods under the provisions of TSREEA of 2000.

Defines "payment in cash" with respect to certain prohibitions on financing of U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba.

Prohibits the President from restricting direct transfers from a Cuban financial institution to a U.S. financial institution executed in payment for a product authorized for sale under TSREEA of 2000.</summary>
