  <summary date="2007-10-16T18:08:06Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting though the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to award matching contracts or competitive grants to support demonstration programs that design, implement, and evaluate innovative models of regionalized, comprehensive, and accountable emergency care systems. Requires the Secretary to give priority to entities that serve a medically underserved population.

Requires the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary, to enter into a contract with an academic institution or other entity to conduct an independent evaluation of the demonstration programs funded under this Act.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) support federal programs involved in improving the emergency care system to expand and accelerate research in emergency medical care systems and emergency medicine; and (2) support research to determine the estimated economic impact of, and savings that result from, the implementation of coordinated emergency care systems.</summary>
