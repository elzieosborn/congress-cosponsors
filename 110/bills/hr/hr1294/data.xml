  <summary date="2007-07-10T15:52:24Z" status="Passed House amended">Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2007 - Extends federal recognition to the following Indian tribes of Virginia and states their relationship with the federal government as described below: (1) the Chickahominy Tribe; (2) the Chickahominy Indian Tribe--Eastern Division; (3) the Upper Mattaponi Tribe; (4) the Rappahannock Tribe, Inc.; (5) the Monacan Indian Nation; and (6) the Nansemond Indian Tribe.

Makes each Tribe and tribal members eligible for all services and benefits provided by the federal government to federally recognized Indian tribes. Sets forth the service area of the Tribe and requirements for the Tribe with respect to submission of a membership roll and governing documents and the governing body of the Tribe.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior, upon a certain land transfer, to take specified lands into trust for the benefit of the Tribe, which shall be considered part of the Tribe's reservation. Prohibits the Tribe from conducting gaming activities.

Specifies this Act's effect with regard to the hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, and water rights of the Tribe and its members.

Grants the state of Virginia jurisdiction over criminal offenses and civil actions on lands within Virginia that are owned by or held in trust for the Tribe. Authorizes the Secretary to accept all or a portion of the state's jurisdiction over such offenses and actions upon verification by the Secretary of a certification by a tribe that it possesses the capacity to reassume such jurisdiction.</summary>
