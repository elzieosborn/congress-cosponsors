Sets such such allowance at $1,000 per month. (Current law allows an amount at the discretion of the Secretary of the military department concerned, not to exceed $1,000.) Repeals the authority to exclude from eligibility for such allowance specified duty assignments approved by the Secretary of Defense.\n\nAllows for the payment of such allowance in the case of excess active-duty rotation frequencies for reserve personnel."
