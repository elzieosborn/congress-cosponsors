  <summary date="2008-09-30T21:31:11Z" status="Passed House amended">Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act - Amends the National Trails System Act to designate a corridor of approximately 600 miles following the route taken by the armies of General George Washington and Count Rochambeau between Newport, Rhode Island, and Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781 and 1782, as the "Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail."

Requires the Trail to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with: (1) other federal, state, tribal, and local agencies; and (2) the private sector.

Prohibits the United States from acquiring for the Trail any land or interest in land: (1) outside the exterior boundary of any federally-managed area without the owner's consent; and (2) acquired from a state or local government if that land was acquired by such government through eminent domain.

Prohibits anything in this Act from affecting: (1) the development, production, conveyance, and transmission of energy; (2) state management, control, and regulation of fish and resident wildlife; and (3) access for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting.

Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and private industry, to submit a report which: (1) contains a description of the energy resources available on such land and report on the amount of energy withdrawn from possible development; and (2) identifies the oil, natural gas, geothermal, wind, and solar energy that could be commercially produced, the annual available biomass for energy production, and any hydropower resources available, including tidal, dams, and in-stream flow turbines, and any impact on electricity transmission.</summary>
