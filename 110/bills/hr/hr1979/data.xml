Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act of 2007 - Requires each federal and state court to recognize any lawful notarization occurring in or affecting interstate commerce which is made by a notary public licensed or commissioned under the laws of a state other than the state where the court is located.

Requires such a notarization to: (1) use a seal of office as symbol of the notary public's authority; or (2) have the seal information, in the case of an electronic record, securely attached to, or logically associated with, the electronic record so as to render the record tamper-resistant.</summary>
