  <summary date="2007-10-24T20:01:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Instructional Leadership Act of 2007 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to states, local educational agencies, nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, or partnerships or consortia which include at least one of those entities to develop innovative programs and sites (such as leadership development schools) to train school principals in instructional leadership skills.

Requires the Secretary to award additional competitive grants to states or partnerships or consortia which include states for pilot programs that evaluate and promote the incorporation of instructional leadership standards into state principal certification or licensure.

 Directs the Secretary to establish a definition of "highly-qualified principal" that is based on reports from this Act's grantees and emphasizes instructional leadership standards.</summary>
