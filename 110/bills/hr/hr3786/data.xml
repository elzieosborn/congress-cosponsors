  <summary date="2008-03-12T16:38:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Servicemembers Telecom Contract Relief Act - Allows a person in military service to terminate a telecommunications contract for cellular phone service, cable or satellite television service, or internet service at any time after: (1) entry into military service; or (2) the date of the station or deployment orders.

Requires for termination that: (1) the contract is executed by or on behalf of a person who thereafter and during the term of the contract enters military service (or receives order to enter military service) under an order specifying a period of not less than 90 days (or who enters military service under an order specifying a period of 90 days or less and who, without a break in service, receives orders extending the period of military service to a period of not less than 90 days); or (2) the person enters into the contract while in military service and thereafter receives military orders for a permanent change of station outside of the continental United States, or to deploy with a military unit for a period of not less than 90 days, to a location that does not support continuation of the service under the contract.</summary>
