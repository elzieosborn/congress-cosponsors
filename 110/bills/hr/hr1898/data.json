Limits the amount of such credit to $500 (adjusted for inflation) per dependent. Increases the amount of the credit to $3,000 (adjusted for inflation) for a dependent who has a terminal disease, cancer, a disability, or any other health condition requiring hospitalization or other forms of specialized care. (Coordinates the credit allowed by this Act with the income tax credit for household and dependent care expenses and the income tax deduction for medical expenses to prevent a double tax benefit.)"
