Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to allow the use of helicopters for the operation, maintenance, and repair of such dams and water impoundments on such Lakes. Designates the potential wilderness additions as wilderness and incorporates them into the John Krebs Wilderness upon termination of the non-conforming uses.\n\nDesignates certain lands in California in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks as wilderness areas and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System and which shall be considered to be a part of the Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness.\n\nInstructs the Secretary to continue to manage the maintenance and access to hydrologic, meteorologic, and climatological devices, facilities, and associated equipment consistent with House Report 98-40.\n\nSpecifies this Act's effect with regard to: (1) authorized activities conducted outside outside of an area designated as wilderness by this Act by cabin owners (or designees) in the Mineral King Valley area and property owners and lessees (or designees) in the Silver City inholding; and (2) recreational and commercial horseback riding in the wilderness areas.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations."
