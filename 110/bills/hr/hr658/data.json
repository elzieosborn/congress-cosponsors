The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)\n\n\n\nNatural Resource Protection Cooperative Agreement Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with state, local, or tribal governments, other federal agencies, other public entities, educational institutions, private nonprofit organizations, or participating private landowners for the purpose of protecting natural resources of units of the National Park System through collaborative efforts on land inside and outside of National Park System units. States that such an agreement shall provide clear and direct benefits to park natural resources and shall provide for: (1) the preservation, conservation, and restoration of coastal and riparian systems, watersheds, and wetlands; (2) preventing, controlling, or eradicating invasive exotic species that are within a unit of the National Park System or adjacent to such a unit; or (3) restoration of natural resources, including native wildlife habitat or ecosystems.\n\nBars the Secretary from using any funds associated with such an agreement for the purposes of land acquisition, regulatory activity, or the development, maintenance, or operation of infrastructure, except for ancillary support facilities that the Secretary determines to be necessary for the completion of projects or activities identified in the agreement.\n\nLimits the funds available to carry out the provisions of this Act to programs and amounts specified in the statute for such use in the annual appropriation Act for the National Park Service."
