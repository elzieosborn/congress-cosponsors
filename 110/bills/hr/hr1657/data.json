The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a Science and Technology Scholarship Program to award scholarships to students at institutions of higher education to recruit and prepare them for careers in the National Weather Service and in NOAA marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs.\n\nRequires individuals to be selected to receive scholarships under this Act through a competitive process primarily based on academic merit, with consideration given to financial need and to the goal of promoting the participation of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities as identified under provisions of the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act.\n\nRequires the Administrator to enter into contractual agreements with selected individuals under which such individuals, in exchange for receiving a scholarship, agree to serve as full-time employees of NOAA, for a 24-month period of obligated service for each academic year for which a scholarship is provided in positions needed by NOAA in marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs.\n\nInstructs the Administrator to make publicly available a list of academic programs and fields of study for which scholarships may be utilized in marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs and to update such list as necessary.\n\nProhibits: (1) an individual from receiving a scholarship for more than four academic years, unless the Administrator grants a waiver; and (2) the amount of a scholarship from exceeding the cost of attendance.\n\nPermits a scholarship to be used for tuition, fees, and other authorized uses as established by the Administrator by regulation.\n\nAllows the Administrator to enter into a contractual agreement with an institution of higher education under which the amounts provided for a scholarship for tuition, fees, and other authorized expenses are paid directly to the institution with respect to which the scholarship is provided.\n\nSets forth penalties for specified breaches of scholarship agreements."
