Requires the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to brief such committees on matters contained in the reports. Terminates the reporting and briefing requirements on the date on which the Secretary certifies to such committees that the Armed Forces are no longer primarily engaged in a combat mission in Iraq."
