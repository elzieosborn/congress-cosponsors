(Sec. 105) Requires, both in the United States and abroad, that solicitations of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts for anti-trafficking programs be made publicly available and that the award of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts be made on a full and open competitive basis. Directs the President to: (1) establish related performance goals and indicators; and (2) ensure that U.S. development and emergency programs are carried out consistent with policies and programs to combat trafficking.

Requires the Director to provide U.S. assistance consistent with annual reporting priorities and country assessments.

Obligates specified FY2008-FY2011 funds for activities under this section.

(Sec. 106) Repeals the limitation that only countries with a significant number of trafficking victims be monitored.

Revises the criteria for determining whether a country is making significant efforts to combat trafficking, including the addition of criteria respecting: (1) law enforcement and immigration training in the identification and treatment of trafficking victims; and (2) efforts to reduce commercial sex acts and sex tourism.

(Sec. 107) Deems a country that has been on the special watch list for two consecutive years to be not making significant efforts to combat trafficking unless the Secretary of State determines that the country: (1) has a written plan that would constitute making such efforts; and (2) is devoting sufficient resources to the plan's implementation.

Prohibits A-3 or G-5 visa issuance if the individual who would hire such alien is from a diplomatic mission or international institution where trafficking or other abuse has previously occurred or an individual has departed the United States because of such abuse unless a mechanism is in place to prevent future abuse. Requires the Secretary of State to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on diplomatic missions and international institutions affected, exceptions made, and waivers of diplomatic immunity requested.

(Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary of Labor to report on Department of Labor progress in monitoring and combatting forced labor and child labor.

(Sec. 112) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should seek to establish a multilateral framework between labor exporting and labor importing countries to ensure that workers migrating between such countries are protected from trafficking in persons and worker exploitation.

Title II: Combatting Trafficking in Persons in the United States - Subtitle A: Ensuring Availability of Possible Witnesses and Informants - (Sec. 201) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) with respect to nonimmigrant T-visas (victims of severe form of trafficking in persons) to authorize aliens to apply for such visas who are: (1) brought into the country for investigations or as witnesses; (2) unable to participate in a law enforcement interview because of physical or psychological trauma; or (3) parents or siblings who face retaliation as a result of their family member's escape from trafficking or cooperation with law enforcement.

Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) extend the period of T-visa and U-visa (victims of certain crimes) status; (2) consider when determining extreme hardship whether the country to which the alien is likely to be removed can address security concerns and the alien's mental and physical health needs; and (3) waive the disqualification for lack of good moral character for T-visa holders applying for adjustment to permanent resident status if the disqualification is caused by or incident to the trafficking.

(Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to create and make available (including in translation) an information pamphlet on legal rights and resources for aliens applying for employment- or education-based nonimmigrant visas, which shall include information respecting: (1) nonimmigrant visa application processes; (2) the illegality of slavery, peonage, trafficking in persons, sexual assault, extortion, blackmail, and worker exploitation in the United States; (3) legal rights and services for trafficking victims and worker exploitation in the United States; and (4) foreign labor contracting requirements.

(Sec. 204) Amends TVPA to authorize: (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security, upon application from a federal law enforcement official, to permit an alien trafficking victim's continued presence in the United States in order to effectuate investigation and prosecution of the traffickers; and (2) law enforcement officials to request the parole entry of specified relatives of such an alien. Directs the Secretary to permit such alien's continued presence if the alien has filed a civil action against the traffickers.

(Sec. 213) Amends TVPA to direct: (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon credible information that a child has been a trafficking victim, to provide interim assistance to the child for up to 90 days (with a 30-day extension); (2) federal and state and local officials to notify the Secretary within 48 hours and 72 hours, respectively, of learning of such a child; and (3) the Secretary and the Attorney General to provide appropriate training for state and local officials.

(Sec. 214) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to: (1) establish an assistance program for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who are victims of severe forms of trafficking; and (2) make grants to states, Indian tribes, local government, and nonprofit victims' service organizations to develop and expand victim service programs.

Authorizes FY2008-FY2011 appropriations.

Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to state that the terms "victim," "crime victim," and "victim of crime" include an individual who is exploited or otherwise victimized by any person who is in violation of: (1) federal criminal code provisions respecting transportation for illegal sexual activity and related crimes; (2) INA provisions respecting importation of aliens for immoral purposes; or (3) any similar state offense regardless of whether such offense involves participation in a commercial sex act.

Requires that: (1) applications for certain grants to states, Indian tribes, local government, and nonprofit victims' service organizations for assistance programs for victims of severe forms of trafficking or sex trafficking include a statement of whether the services will be available to both U.S. citizens and foreign victims, or if not, what mechanisms will be undertaken to ensure that all victims are assisted; and (2) the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services report to the appropriate congressional committees identifying any service gap between foreign and U.S. citizen victims of severe forms of trafficking and victims of sex trafficking.

Subtitle C: Penalties Against Traffickers and Other Related Offenses - (Sec. 221) Amends the federal criminal code to establish and provide penalties for the crime of aggravated sex trafficking. (Repeals the existing provision respecting sex trafficking of children, or by force, fraud, or coercion.)

Subjects to fine and/or imprisonment any person who knowingly, with intent to obtain or maintain the labor or services of a person or to obtain or maintain a person for use in a commercial sex act: (1) prevents or restricts such person's travel or movement by destroying or preventing access to immigration or identification documents; (2) acts or fails to act under color of official right; (3) blackmails another person; or (4) causes or exploits financial harm or a fear of financial harm on the part of such person.

Revises restitution of forfeited asset provisions.

Requires that a civil action against the perpetrator or knowing beneficiary of an act of peonage, slavery, or trafficking into servitude begin within 10 years after the cause of action arises.
