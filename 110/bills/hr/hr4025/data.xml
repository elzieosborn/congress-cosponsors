  <summary date="2008-06-06T19:08:46Z" status="Introduced in House">Makes a technical amendment to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 with respect to minimum distributions from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to certain states and Indian tribes with approved abandoned mine reclamation programs.

Exempts from any other requirements or restrictions of such Act the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior ensure that grant awards for approved abandoned mine reclamation programs total at least $3 million annually to each state and each Indian tribe with an approved program (including those which otherwise do not meet the active mining threshold for full funding), as well as eligible land and water, so long as an allocation of funds to the state or tribe is necessary to achieve specified reclamation priorities.</summary>
