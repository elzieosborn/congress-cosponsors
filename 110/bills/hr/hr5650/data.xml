Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to: (1) prohibit the President from contributing federal funds to a state or local government or private nonprofit organization for the repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of donated real property that the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) determines is not critical to the public welfare; and (2) repeal a provision authorizing a state or local government to elect to receive in lieu of such public facility funds a contribution equal to 90% of the federal share of the estimated cost of repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing a facility and of management expenses if such government determines that conducting such activity would not best serve the public welfare.</summary>
