Terminates such requirement for withdrawal of the public land two years after enactment of this Act or upon the completion of the conveyance under this Act.\n\nInstructs the Secretary to retain the authority to place conditions on the license granted to the Secretary under the Federal Power Act to insure adequate protection and utilization of the public land until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a new license for the Wells Hydroelectric Project to replace the original license expiring on May 31, 2012."
