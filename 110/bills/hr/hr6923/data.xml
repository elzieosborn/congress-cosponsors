  <summary date="2008-11-26T20:40:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Complete the Fence Act - Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to: (1) provide that fencing that does not effectively restrain pedestrian traffic may not be used to meet the requirement that the Secretary of Homeland Security construct reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest U.S. border; (2) require the Secretary to complete construction of such fencing and installation of related equipment by December 31, 2010; and (3) prohibit any amounts appropriated for such fencing from being withheld because of the Secretary's failure to comply fully with consultation requirements regarding its impact on nearby communities and residents.

Requires the Secretary to report to Congress by June 30, 2009, on progress made in completing such fencing and on plans for completing it by the deadline.</summary>
