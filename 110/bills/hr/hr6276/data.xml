Public Housing Disaster Relief Act of 2008 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to the Public Housing Capital and Operating Funds. Repeals the requirement that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development set-aside up to 2% of annual appropriations to provide assistance for emergencies and other disasters, and housing needs resulting from any litigation settlement, including a specified allocation to the Operation Safe Home program, administered by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for law enforcement efforts to combat violent crime on or near the premises of public and federally assisted housing.

(Currently such funds may be used for emergency assistance for any eligible use under the Operating Fund or the Capital Fund, or for tenant-based assistance).</summary>
