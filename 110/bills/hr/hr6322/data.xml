Public Charter Schools Home Rule Act of 2008 - Amends the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995 to grant authority to the District of Columbia government to regulate the Public Charter School Board with respect to its membership and the process by which Board members are appointed.

Allows the current process to remain in effect until the District enacts a law that establishes such membership and process.

Repeals: (1) certain requirements for annual reporting to the federal government by eligible chartering authorities and the State Education Office; and (2) the requirement that the District's Board of Education provide the federal government with access to its fiscal and staffing data.</summary>
