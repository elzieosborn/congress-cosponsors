Requires the Comptroller General to submit to each House of Congress a weekly report containing a list of the rules received by the Comptroller General, including a notation indicating whether or not a rule is a major rule.

Requires the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate to publish in the Congressional Record each report received from the Comptroller General and a statement of referral to the committee or committees responsible for the review of the rules in each such report.</summary>
