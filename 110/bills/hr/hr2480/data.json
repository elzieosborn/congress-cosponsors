Provides for adjustments to such excise taxes for floor stocks of motor fuels held by dealers prior to or after the suspension period.\n\nRepeals provisions allowing a taxpayer election to expense the cost of qualified refinery property. Transfers to the Highway Trust Fund increased tax revenues resulting from such repeal.\n\nRequires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to monitor gasoline prices in the United States and to report to Congress on its findings.\n\nRequires the Speaker of the House of Representatives to establish a Commission on Gas Price Relief to study the causes of high oil prices."
