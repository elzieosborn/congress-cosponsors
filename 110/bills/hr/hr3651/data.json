Requires that any such determination be made in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Governor of Utah and on the record after an opportunity for comment.\n\nRequires the state, with respect to any part of the land conveyed that the Secretary determines is subject to reversion and if the Secretary also determines that the part contains hazardous materials, to pay the United States the fair market value of that part of the conveyed land. Bars the application of the reversionary interest to that part of the land."
