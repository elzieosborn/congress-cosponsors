  <summary date="2008-11-07T16:28:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Water Use Efficiency and Conservation Research Act - Requires the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Assistant Administrator for Research and Development to establish a research and development program to promote water use efficiency and conservation, including: (1) technologies and processes that enable the collection, treatment, and reuse of rainwater and greywater; (2) water storage and distribution systems; and (3) behavioral, social, and economic barriers to achieving greater water use efficiency.

Requires the Assistant Administrator to: (1) facilitate the adoption of technology and processes to increase water use, water efficiency, and conservation; and (2) collect and disseminate information on technologies and processes to increase water use and conservation, including information on incentives and impediments to development and commercialization, best practices, and anticipated increases in water use efficiency resulting from the implementation of specific technologies and processes.</summary>
