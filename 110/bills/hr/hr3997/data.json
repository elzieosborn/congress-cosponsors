    "text": "Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax relief and earnings assistance to members of the uniformed services, increase penalties for noncompliance with tax requirements, and make technical amendments and clerical corrections.\n\nTitle I: Benefits for Military - (Sec. 101) Makes permanent the taxpayer election to include combat zone compensation as earned income for purposes of computing the earned income tax credit.\n\n(Sec. 102) Makes permanent the eligibility of veterans for mortgage bond financing of residences without regard to first-time homebuyer requirements.\n\nIncreases to $100 million the veterans' mortgage bond limitation in Alaska, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Revises the definition of \"qualified veteran\" for mortgage bond financing eligibility purposes to make such definition applicable to veterans in all states.\n\n(Sec. 103) Requires tax-qualified pension plans to entitle survivors of plan participants who die while on active military duty to additional benefits and benefit accruals provided under such plans for participants who resume and then terminate employment due to death.\n\n(Sec. 104) Treats differential wage payments to an employee as a payment of wages for income tax purposes. Defines \"differential wage payment\" as any employer payment to an individual serving on active duty in the uniformed services for more than 30 days that represents wages such individual would have received if such individual were performing services for the employer.\n\nTreats an individual receiving differential wage payments as an employee and treats such payments as compensation for retirement plan purposes.\n\n(Sec. 105) Allows members of the uniformed services whose retired pay in any taxable year is reduced due to an award of disability compensation by the Department of Veterans Affairs an extension of the three-year limitation period for filing tax refund claims until one year after the date of a disability determination. Limits the period for which such refund claims may be filed to taxable years beginning more than five years before the date of a disability determination.\n\n(Sec. 106) Makes permanent the tax exemption for distributions from retirement plans for individuals ordered or called to active duty after December 31, 2007.\n\n(Sec. 107) Makes permanent the authority of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to disclose tax information to the Department of Veterans Affairs for veteran benefit payment purposes.\n\n(Sec. 108) Allows a tax-free rollover of any military death gratuity and any group life insurance payment to a survivor's Roth individual retirement account (Roth IRA) or to an education savings account.\n\n(Sec. 109) Allows a Peace Corps volunteer an election to suspend for five years while serving as a volunteer the ownership and use requirements for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a principal residence.\n\n(Sec. 110) Allows certain small business employers a tax credit for up to 20% of the differential wage payments made for the benefit of active duty members of the Armed Forces.\n\n(Sec. 111) Allows an exclusion from gross income for bonus payments made by a state or its political subdivision to current or former members of the uniformed services (or dependents) for service in a combat zone.\n\n(Sec. 112) Makes permanent the exclusion from the gross income of certain employees of the intelligence community of gain from the sale of their principal residences without regard to otherwise applicable five-year residential use and holding requirements.\n\n(Sec. 113) Allows a tax-free distribution of unused benefits in a health flexible spending arrangement to any member of an Armed Forces reserve component who is ordered or called to active duty.\n\n(Sec. 114) Excludes basic military housing allowances as an item of income for determining eligibility for tax-subsidized residential rental housing.\n\nTitle II: Revenue Provisions - (Sec. 201) Increases the penalties for failure to file partnership tax returns, S corporation tax returns, and individual tax returns.\n\n(Sec. 204) Sets forth additional rules for the tax treatment of high-income individuals who relinquish U.S. citizenship or residency to avoid U.S. taxation (expatriates). Treats all property of expatriates as sold for its fair market value on the day before the expatriation date and includes gain (over $600,000) or loss from such sale in the gross income of such expatriates.
