Defines eligible entities as specified tax-exempt organizations or state or local governments.\n\nProhibits the use of grants for the maintenance, operating costs, or construction of any facility to house the historical records or documents.\n\nProhibits the Commission from approving a grant application unless an entity establishes that it meets certain requirements, including that it: (1) ensures the preservation of, and access to, such historical works and collections of historical sources at no charge to the public; (2) has educational programs that make the use of such documents part of the entity's mission; and (3) has raised funds from nonfederal sources in support of the entity's efforts to promote such preservation and access."
