  <summary date="2008-11-13T21:23:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Family and Medical Leave Enhancement Act of 2008 - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) to cover employees at worksites that employ fewer than 50 employees, but not fewer than 25 employees. Continues to exempt from FMLA coverage employees at worksites that employ fewer than 25 employees (currently 50), if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is fewer than 25 (currently 50).

Allows an employee covered by FMLA to take up to 4 hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement leave to participate in or attend activities that: (1) are sponsored by a school or community organization; and (2) relate to a program of the school or organization that is attended by the employee's child or grandchild.

Allows the aggregate amount of parental involvement leave for a husband and wife employed by the same employer to be limited to the amount allowed for one employee.

Applies the parental involvement leave allowance to federal employees.

Includes under FMLA entitlement leave to meet routine family medical care needs, including: (1) transportation of a child or grandchild for medical and dental appointments for annual checkups and vaccinations; and (2) care of an elderly individual related to the employee, including visits to nursing homes and group homes. Allows the aggregate amount of such leave for a husband and wife employed by the same employer to be limited to the amount allowed for one employee.

Allows an employee to elect, or an employer to require, substitution of any of the paid or family leave of the employee for any leave provided under this Act.

Imposes requirements of notification by the employee of leave requests. Allows an employer to require certification supporting such requests.</summary>
