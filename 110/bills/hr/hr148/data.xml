  <summary date="2007-03-01T22:36:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Neighborhood Rail Accountability Act - Amends federal transportation law to require the Surface Transportation Board, in determining whether to issue a certificate authorizing the construction of an additional railroad line or of an extension to any railroad line, to: (1) give greater weight to local official statements and public comments in opposition to the proposed construction (especially construction in a residential area) if there is an unusually high level of public opposition; and (2) identify any disproportionate negative impacts on any socioeconomic population, including a discussion of alternatives that were considered that would have avoided such impacts.

Prescribes procedural requirements for dealing with any false or incorrect information provided by an applicant for a certificate for construction.</summary>
