  <summary date="2008-06-10T15:11:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Fairness in Trucking Transactions Act - Amends federal transportation law to require certain fuel cost reimbursements by a motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder providing or arranging truckload transportation or service using fuel for which it does not bear the cost.

Requires such a motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder to reimburse persons (truckers) that do bear fuel costs for any such costs they have paid.

Prohibits any person from causing a motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder to present false or misleading information on a document or in an oral representation about the actual rate, charge, or allowance to any party to the transaction or transportation.

Sets forth additional civil penalties (including the award of treble damages by a court) for a motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder that fails to make a fuel cost payment to the cost bearer.

Provides for the confidentiality of information obtained by the Secretary of Transportation or the Surface Transportation Board in investigations of alleged violations of the payment of fuel costs.</summary>
