Prohibits such member from being evaluated during the one-year period by a physical evaluation board for determining eligibility for retirement or separation due to such disability. Allows a member (or his or her guardian or legal advocate) to choose to make such requirements inapplicable to the member. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to extend the one-year period as appropriate in light of medical progress.\n\nRequires annual Comptroller General assessments of traumatic brain injury care and services provided by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs."
