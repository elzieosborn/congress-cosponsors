  <summary date="2008-01-31T21:17:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Safe Schools and Health Care Professional Pipeline Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a grant to a qualified youth serving organization to establish and expand emergency preparedness pipelines consisting of: (1) health science curricula in secondary schools, institutions of higher education, and continuing education programs that prepare students for careers as health care professionals; and (2) school-based emergency preparedness chapters.

 Requires such a chapter to recruit and prepare students for federal, state, community, and school public health emergencies under the administration of such an organization and to provide training that is implemented uniformly, coordinated with and integrated into the school's health science curriculum, and provided through certified health science instructors serving as chapter advisors.

Defines a "qualified youth serving organization" as a nonprofit organization that prepares youth exclusively for career entry and advancement opportunities in the health professions, offers a national recognition and competitive events program, and operates at least 2,500 chapters in at least 40 states.

Requires the Secretary to make a grant each year to such an organization to conduct a national leadership conference that includes representatives of health science programs, emergency preparedness chapters, and the Medical Reserve Corps.</summary>
