(Currently, such regulations may be effective and final immediately on an interim basis as of their publication date.)

Requires such regulations to be consistent with: (1) federal rule making notice and comment requirements, except that the period of public comment on them shall be at least 80 days; and (2) congressional review requirements.

Makes the regulations effective at least 90 days after publication in the Federal Register or presentation to each chamber or the Comptroller General, whichever occurs later.

Repeals the Secretary's authority to change or revise such regulations after completion of the comment period.</summary>
