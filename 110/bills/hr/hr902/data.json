Requires such assistance to be provided for: (1) at least one project in each of the Upper Basin States (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming); and (2) at least one project in at least one of the Lower Basin States (Arizona, California, and Nevada). Prohibits such assistance from exceeding $1 million for any project or from being used to pay more than 50% of project cost or for facility operation or maintenance. Authorizes appropriations."
