Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance for the development of facilities, technologies, and processes to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of: (1) optimizing energy resource production by reducing the quantity of produced water generated; or (2) increasing the extent to which produced water may be recovered and made suitable for irrigation, municipal, or industrial uses or other purposes without adversely affecting water quality or the environment. Requires such assistance to be provided for: (1) at least one project in each of the Upper Basin States (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming); and (2) at least one project in at least one of the Lower Basin States (Arizona, California, and Nevada).
