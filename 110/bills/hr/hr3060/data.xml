  <summary date="2007-10-05T13:51:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Colorectal Cancer Screening and Detection Coverage Age of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to require a group health plan to provide coverage for colorectal screening for any participant or beneficiary who is 50 years of age or older or at high risk for colorectal cancer under terms and conditions that are no less favorable than those applicable to other screening benefits provided under the plan. Prohibits specified actions by group health plans to avoid the requirements of this Act, including denying enrollment, penalizing the provision of required services, or providing incentives for care inconsistent with this Act.

Requires such plan to provide certain disclosures to participants and beneficiaries, including regarding covered benefits, cost sharing, and participating providers.

Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to modify coverage requirements under this Act to incorporate new scientific and technological advances, practice pattern changes, or other updated medical practices regarding colorectal screening.

Applies such requirements to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market and coverage under the federal employees health benefits program (FEHBP).</summary>
