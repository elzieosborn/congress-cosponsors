  <summary date="2008-11-18T22:52:34Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Homeland Security Open Source Information Enhancement Act of 2008 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source and the Director of National Intelligence, to establish an open source collection, analysis, and dissemination program within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

Defines "open source information" to mean publicly available information that can be lawfully obtained by a member of the public by request, purchase, or observation. Requires the program to make full and efficient use of open source information to develop and disseminate open source alerts, warnings, and other intelligence products relating to the mission of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

 Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that DHS makes full and efficient use of such information in intelligence analysis to identify terrorist threats; and (2) make DHS open source information available to federal, state, local, tribal, and private-sector entities, using systems and networks for the dissemination of homeland security information.

Directs: (1) the Secretary to ensure that the manner in which open source information is gathered and disseminated complies with all relevant federal laws; and (2) the Chief Privacy Officer of DHS to include in such Officer's annual report submitted to Congress an assessment of compliance by federal departments and agencies with laws relating to the use of open source information.</summary>
