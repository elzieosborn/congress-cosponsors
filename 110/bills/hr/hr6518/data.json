Requires each advisory group to: (1) collect and analyze data on the race and ethnicity of defendants at each stage of a criminal proceeding; (2) seek to determine causes of racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice process; and (3) submit to the U.S. attorney a report and proposed plan for addressing such disparities. Requires each U.S. attorney to annually evaluate the efficacy of a plan submitted by an advisory group.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to: (1) prepare a comprehensive report on all advisory group plans and submit such report and plans to Congress; and (2) exercise continuing oversight of the criminal justice system to reduce unwarranted racial and ethnic disparities and improve such system."
