 Revises under NSCA: (1) the School-Based and Community-Based Service-Learning programs and Higher Education Innovative Programs for Community Service (Learn and Serve programs); (2) National Service Trust programs (AmeriCorps); (3) the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC); and (4) the Investment for Quality and Innovation program.

Eliminates the current Community-Based Learn and Serve programs.

Establishes a new Learn and Serve program, Innovative Service-Learning Programs and Research, providing matching grants to: (1) provide community service-learning opportunities to elementary and secondary, college, and graduate students, including summer of service programs; and (2) research and evaluate service-learning.

Includes among eligible AmeriCorps programs: (1) an E-corp program increasing community access to technology; (2) a program engaging citizens in public safety, health, and emergency preparedness services; (3) a youth mentoring program; (4) a program to reduce recidivism by re-engaging court-involved youth; and (5) the Education Awards Only program.

Establishes an AmeriCorp pilot grant program for state-approved, member-selected, national service positions.

Increases National Service educational awards for AmeriCorps, NCCC, and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) participants.

Includes among needs to be met under the NCCC program, disaster relief, infrastructure improvement, environmental and energy conservation, and urban and rural development.

Requires states to develop comprehensive plans for volunteer and paid service by Baby Boomers and older adults.

Establishes an Office of Outreach and Recruitment in the Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation).

 Requires the Corporation to plan pilot service programs to better utilize and serve veterans and displaced workers.

Authorizes the Corporation to provide grants to innovative and model service programs that include service programs for disadvantaged youth.

Eliminates federal funding for the Points of Light Foundation.

Establishes a new Energy Conservation Corps program awarding: (1) matching grants to states for projects providing youth and young adults with career training in support of energy conservation, infrastructure and transportation improvement, and emergency operations; (2) competitive grants for school-based green Learn and Serve programs; and (3) competitive grants to National Senior Service Corps (Senior Corps) programs involving seniors in energy efficient housing, infrastructure rehabilitation, and environmental and energy conservation education projects.

Revises under DVSA: (1) the VISTA program; and (2) the Senior Corps, including the Retired and Senior Volunteer program (RSVP), the Foster Grandparent program, and the Senior Companion program.

Gives priority in VISTA participant selection to disadvantaged youth and retired adults of any profession.

Authorizes new VISTA grant programs of national significance that provide poor and rural communities with: (1) services reintegrating formerly incarcerated individuals into society; (2) financial literacy and planning; (3) before-school and after-school services; (4) community economic development initiatives; (5) assistance to veterans and their families; and (6) health and wellness services.

Congressional Commission on Civic Service Act - Establishes a Congressional Commission on Civic Service to provide recommendations to Congress on improving opportunities for individuals to volunteer or perform national service.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the Corporation should try to: (1) coordinate its service programs so that senior citizens and their grandchildren can share volunteer opportunities and/or be assigned to the same geographic area; and (2) work with the National Endowment for the Humanities to provide opportunities for young service participants to collect oral histories from senior citizens.</summary>
