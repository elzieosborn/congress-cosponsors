Expands the tax credit for clinical testing expenses for drugs to treat rare diseases (orphan drugs) to include expenses incurred after an application is made to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but before receipt of an orphan drug designation.

Allows individual taxpayers a 20% tax credit for equity investments in small biomedical research firms engaged in incubational research (i.e., research conducted prior to large-scale clinical trials).</summary>
