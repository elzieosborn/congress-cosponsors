Directs the President to designate the Director to serve as a Cabinet member in the event of specified disasters.\n\nEstablishes as FEMA's primary mission to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the nation from all hazards, including natural and man-made disasters, through a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation.\n\nPrescribes the Director's responsibilities. Provides for 10 regional offices. Requires each Regional Administrator to: (1) establish a Regional Advisory Council; and (2) oversee multi-agency strike teams.
