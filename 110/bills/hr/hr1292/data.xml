  <summary date="2007-03-05T18:15:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Repeals P.L. 107-243 (Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002).

Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Congress should vote on a new authorization for use of force resolution that reflects the current Iraq situation, abandons the Bush Doctrine of preemption and unilateralism, and realigns U.S. policy with its long-held priorities of diplomacy, deterrence, and containment; (2) the United States should establish a quick-reaction U.S. military force with an over-the-horizon presence in the region; (3) the United States should intensify diplomatic relations to support the difficult internal steps that the government of Iraq should take to promote national reconciliation; (4) the United States should increase efforts to engage all neighboring countries and the League of Arab States in promoting Iraq's stability; (5) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq; (6) the United States should redirect diplomatic, economic, and military support to Afghanistan; and (7) the United States should aggressively pursue Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations that continue to pose an imminent threat to the United States.</summary>
