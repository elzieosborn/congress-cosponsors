Permits the Secretary and the city to reserve any other rights-of-way for utilities, roads, and trails that are mutually agreed to and considered to be in the public interest.\n\n Authorizes the Secretary, by sale or exchange, to dispose of all or a portion of certain National Forest System land comprising approximately 220 acres after the conveyance of the federal land authorized for exchange under this Act, if the land or portion of the land is in excess of the needs of the National Forest System. Specifies that such a determination be made: (1) pursuant to an amendment of the land and resource management plan for the Wasatch-Cache National Forest; and (2) after carrying out a public process consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n\nInstructs the Secretary to require payment of an amount equal to not less than the fair market value of the conveyed National Forest System land.\n\nSets forth requirements for the disposition of the proceeds of any amounts received as consideration under this Act."
