  <summary date="2007-07-27T20:47:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007 - Amends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to provide for nationwide expansion of the pilot program for national and state background checks on direct patient access employees of long-term care facilities or providers.

Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to: (1) require screening, including national criminal history background checks, of direct patient access employees of skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, and other long-term care facilities and providers; and (2) prohibit hiring of abusive workers.

Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to ensure that the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System of the FBI has the capacity to store and retrieve fingerprints from its database.

Provides that, in the case where a direct patient access employee is convicted of a crime following the initial national criminal history background check, and the employee's fingerprint matches the prints on file with the FBI, the FBI shall inform the state law enforcement department in order for the state to inform the skilled nursing facility, nursing facility, or long-term care facility or provider of such conviction.</summary>
