Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to permit eligible veterans to receive medical, rehabilitative, and preventative health services from a licensed doctor of chiropractic on a direct access basis at the election of the veteran, if such services are within the State scope of practice of such doctor. Prohibits the Secretary from discriminating among licensed health-care providers in the determination of needed services.</summary>
