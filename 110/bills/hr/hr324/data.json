    "text": "Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to incrementally increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25.\n\nSmall Business Health Fairness Act of 2007 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide for establishment and governance of association health plans (AHPs), which are group health plans whose sponsors are trade, industry, professional, chamber of commerce, or similar business associations, and which meet certain ERISA certification requirements.\n\nEstablishes the Association Health Plan Fund to be used by the Secretary of Labor to make payments to an insurer to maintain coverage for a plan, if there is a reasonable expectation that, without such payments, claims would not be satisfied by reason of termination of coverage.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish a Solvency Standards Working Group.\n\nAllows a state to impose a contribution tax on an association health plan, if the plan commenced operations in such state after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\nPreempts any state law that may preclude a health insurance issuer from: (1) offering health insurance coverage in connection with a certified AHP; or (2) offering health insurance coverage of the same policy type to other employers operating in the state which are eligible for coverage under such AHPs, whether or not such other employers are participating employers in such plan.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to extend through 2011 the increased expensing allowance for small business assets. Revises the definition of \"qualified restaurant property\" to eliminate the requirement that improvements to restaurant property must be placed in service more than three years after the original building is placed in service."
