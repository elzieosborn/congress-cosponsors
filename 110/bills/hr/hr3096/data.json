    "text": "Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2007 - Prohibits U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance as of FY2008 to the government of Vietnam unless the President certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of Vietnam has made substantial progress respecting the release of political and religious prisoners, respecting religious freedoms and the rights of minorities, and respecting access to U.S. refugee programs; and (2) neither any government of Vietnam official nor entity was complicit in a severe form of trafficking in persons (or the government of Vietnam took appropriate steps to end such complicity).\n\nAuthorizes the President to waive such requirements if increased U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance would promote the purposes of this Act or is otherwise in the U.S. national interest.\n\nAuthorizes the President to provide U.S. assistance through appropriate nongovernmental organizations and the Human Rights Defenders Fund for the support of individuals and organizations to promote human rights and nonviolent democratic change in Vietnam.\n\nDeclares it is U.S. policy: (1) to take such measures as are necessary to overcome the jamming of Radio Free Asia by the government of Vietnam; and (2) that educational and cultural exchange programs with Vietnam should promote progress toward freedom and democracy. Declares it is U.S. policy to offer refugee resettlement to Vietnam nationals (including members of the Montagnard ethnic minority groups) who are eligible for the Humanitarian Resettlement program, the Orderly Departure program, the Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnamese Returnees program, the Amerasian Homecoming Act of 1988, or any other U.S. refugee program, but who were deemed ineligible for reasons of administrative error or certain circumstances beyond their control."
