  <summary date="2007-08-01T15:42:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Patient Protection and Innovative Biologic Medicines Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow any person to submit an application for approval of a biologics license for a biological product that is claimed to be similar to a qualified biological product (reference product) after 12 years have elapsed since the reference product was approved or licensed.

Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve such a similar biological product: (1) only if the applicant demonstrates that the product conforms to the applicable final product-class specific guidance and the Secretary concludes the product is safe, pure, and potent; (2) only for indications for which the reference product is approved; and (3) to be effective only after at least 14 years have elapsed since the reference product was approved or licensed.

Prohibits the Secretary from designating a similar biological product as therapeutically equivalent to the reference product.



Prohibits the Secretary from approving a product that is claimed to be similar to or the same as a reference product under any other provision of law.

Authorizes any person to request issuance of product-class specific guidance applicable to a qualified biological product and its class.

Requires the Secretary to establish a Similar Biological Products Advisory Committee.

Sets forth provisions governing the naming of biotechnology-derived therapeutic protein and other biological products. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a biotechnology-derived therapeutic protein to be misbranded if its labeling fails to meet the requirements of this Act.</summary>
