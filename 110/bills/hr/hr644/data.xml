Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make grants (without certain otherwise-required loan guarantees) to eligible public entities and Indian tribes to assist in the environmental cleanup and economic development of brownfield sites including mine-scarred lands.

Prohibits: (1) providing or using such grants in a manner that reduces the financial responsibility of any nongovernmental party that is responsible or potentially responsible for contamination on any real property; and (2) the provision of assistance pursuant to this section from in any way relieving any party of liability with respect to such contamination, including liability for removal and remediation costs.

Authorizes FY2008-FY2012 appropriations.

Defines "brownfield site" for purposes of this Act.

Makes brownfields-related environmental cleanup and economic development activities eligible for community development block grant (CDBG) assistance.

Authorizes CDBG use to administer renewal communities.</summary>
