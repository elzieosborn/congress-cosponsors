(Currently, such servicemembers are only permitted to terminate or suspend residential or automobile lease agreements.)\n\n(Sec. 5) Provides penalties under SCRA against creditors for violations of interest rate limits for servicemembers.\n\n(Sec. 6) Allows a military spouse to vote in the same location as the servicemember with respect to federal, state, and local elections.\n\n(Sec. 7) Allows a military spouse to pay taxes in the same state as the servicemember.\n\n(Sec. 8) Provides that compensation of a spouse of a servicemember shall not be considered income within a tax jurisdiction of the United States if, when the compensation is earned, the spouse is not a resident or domiciliary of that jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction is where the servicemember is serving in compliance with military orders."
