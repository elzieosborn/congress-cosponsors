    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on May 7, 2007. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nColumbia-Pacific National Heritage Area Study Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of designating the coastal areas of Clatsop County, Oregon, and Pacific County, Washington (also known as the North Beach Peninsula) and areas relating to Native American history, local history, Euro-American settlement culture, and related economic activities of the Columbia River eastward in Clatsop County and Pacific, Columbia, and Wahkiakum Counties, Washington, as the \"Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area.\"\n\nRequires the study to include analysis, documentation, and determinations on whether the study area: (1) has an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural resources that together represent distinctive aspects of American heritage worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation, and continuing use, and are best managed through partnerships among public and private entities and by combining diverse and sometimes noncontiguous resources and active communities; and (2) provides outstanding recreational and educational opportunities.\n\nInstructs the Secretary, in conducting the study, to analyze the potential impact that designation of the area as a national heritage area is likely to have on land within the proposed area or bordering such area that is privately owned.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a report describing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Secretary with respect to such study."
