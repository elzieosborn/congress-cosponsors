  <summary date="2008-10-16T15:27:43Z" status="Passed House amended">Allows the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to authorize the stocking of fish in lakes in the North Cascades National Park, Ross Lake National Recreation Area, and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.

Authorizes the Secretary to allow stocking in up to, but not over, 42 lakes. Provides that, the 42 lakes that may be stocked are those identified for potential stocking under Alternative B of the 2005 North Cascades National Park Service Complex Mountain Lakes Fishery Management Plan Draft.

Requires the Secretary to only stock fish that are native to the slope of the Cascade Range on which the lake to be stocked is located and are functionally sterile.

Authorizes the Secretary to coordinate the stocking of fish with the state of Washington.

Continues the program of research and monitoring of the impacts of fish stocking on park resources. Instructs the Secretary to report on the results of such research and monitoring program every five years.</summary>
