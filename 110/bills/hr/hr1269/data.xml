Requires the Secretary to implement a security program for covered transportation not assigned to a high- or medium-risk tier.

Requires the Secretary to establish a program for the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to railroad carriers, designated public transportation recipients, and over-the-road bus private operators for certain security improvements.

Makes grants to Amtrak for certain fire and life-safety improvements to tunnels on the Northeast Corridor.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a training program to prepare railroad, public transportation, and over-the-road bus workers for potential threat conditions; and (2) establish a security exercises program for such workers and other named entities to respond to acts of terrorism.

Sets forth certain whistleblower protections for DHS, Department of Transportation (DOT), rail and public transportation, and over-the-road bus employees (including contractors and subcontractors) who have provided information or otherwise assisted in any investigation regarding conduct related to, or who have refused to violate or assist in, the violation of any regulation related to national or homeland security.

Requires an increase in the number of DHS surface transportation security inspectors.

Sets forth civil penalties for violations of regulations and orders of the Secretary.</summary>
