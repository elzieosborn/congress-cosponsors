  <summary date="2009-01-12T20:46:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Medical Information and Treatment Access Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to utilize an Internet site to consolidate and translate federal health care information for the public.

Authorizes health care practitioners to provide unapproved treatments to their patients under specified conditions, including that: (1) the drug used must be an active ingredient in an approved drug or an unapproved drug that is approved for commercial distribution in a foreign country; (2) the practitioner receives informed consent from the patient; (3) the practitioner submits a registration to the Secretary before providing the treatment; and (4) the Secretary determines that there is no clear and convincing evidence that the treatment is unsafe. Deems the registration to be cleared if the Secretary fails to act within 90 days.

Requires the Secretary to establish a program to maintain information regarding registrations under this Act.

Directs the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, to establish a program to gather information from practitioners regarding surgical procedures and make such information publicly available.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine to establish a program to gather information from health care practitioners regarding alternative medicine and make such information publicly available.

Gives a drug or device company immunity from federal and state liability claims for: (1) the use of a relevant unapproved treatment by a practitioner under a cleared registration; and (2) the provision by the company of information upon the request of a practitioner if the company reasonably believes the information to be accurate.</summary>
