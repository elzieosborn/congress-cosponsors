  <summary date="2007-09-11T21:31:56Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Wetland Loan Act to extend funding for conservation of migratory waterfowl and habitat.

Amends the Duck Stamp Act to increase the price of federal migratory-bird hunting and conservation stamps.

Makes amounts appropriated under the Wetlands Loan Act or from the migratory bird conservation fund available to acquire land only if the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission recommends it. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to designate the priority general public uses that will be authorized on such land and the first date on which each designated use will be allowed. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the funds provided pursuant to this Act should be used for preserving and increasing waterfowl populations in accordance with the goals and objectives of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan and should supplement and not replace current conservation funding; and (2) this Act should be implemented in a manner that helps private landowners achieve their long-term land use objectives in ways that enhance the conservation of wetlands and wildlife habitat.</summary>
