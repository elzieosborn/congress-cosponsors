Prescribes a minimum level of retained losses and maximum federal liability.



Authorizes any insurer who participates in an eligible state program to establish a Catastrophe Capital Reserve Fund to hold funds on the Secretary's behalf to offset reinsurance claims.

Establishes the Consumer Hurricane, Earthquake, Loss Protection (HELP) Fund to: (1) make payments to covered purchasers under contracts for reinsurance coverage for eligible losses; and (2) pay for Commission operating costs and reinsurance program administrative expenses.
