    "text": "Safety Net Enhancement Act - Amends the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to revise the federal-state extended unemployment compensation program established under the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise the formula for \"on\" and \"off\" indicators on the state level used to determine extended unemployment compensation benefit periods.\n\nAmends the SSA to require: (1) an increase in earnings credited to a state account in the Unemployment Trust Fund when a state meets funding goals; and (2) a decrease in such earnings credited to a state account when the state fails to meet funding goals.\n\nExcludes any interest premium or penalty from such requirement to the extent that it would result in an increase or decrease of more than $2.5 million in the amount creditable to any state account for any calendar quarter.\n\nAmends the SSA to restrict interest-free advances to state accounts in the Fund to states which meet funding goals.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to require: (1) state collection of federal unemployment tax; and (2) state distribution to unemployed individuals of state-specific information packets explaining unemployment insurance eligibility conditions.\n\nRepeals the tax on unemployment compensation.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Labor to establish a Safety Net Review Commission."
