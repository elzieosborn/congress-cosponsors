Requires withdrawal completion within 180 days after its commencement.

Provides withdrawal exceptions with respect to personnel: (1) providing security for U.S. diplomatic missions in Iraq; or (2) involved in Iraq reconstruction activities.

Directs the President to transfer to the government of Iraq all rights in any military facility in Iraq that was constructed, repaired, or improved using amounts appropriated to DOD and occupied by a unit of the Armed Forces.</summary>
