Provides for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement of such provisions.\n\nMakes such provisions inapplicable to law enforcement agencies.\n\nAmends the Communications Act of 1934 to require a telecommunication carrier to notify a customer of any incidents in which proprietary network information relating to such customer is disclosed to someone other than the customer."
