  <summary date="2008-02-21T20:57:56Z" status="Introduced in House">Community Coalitions for Access and Quality Improvement Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to assist in developing integrated health care delivery systems to serve defined communities of individuals to: (1) improve efficiency and coordination among providers; (2) assist local communities in developing programs targeted toward preventing and managing chronic diseases; and (3) expand and enhance services provided.

Requires eligible entities to represent a balanced consortium whose principal purpose is to ensure sustained capacity for the provision of a broad range of coordinated services for all residents, including at least one of each of the following providers that serve the community (with exceptions): (1) a federally qualified health center; (2) rural health clinics and rural health networks; (3) a hospital with a low-income utilization rate that is greater than 25% or a critical access hospital; (4) a public health department; and (5) an interested public or private sector health care provider or an organization that has traditionally served medically uninsured and low-income individuals.

Authorizes the Secretary, in awarding grants, to accord priority to applicants that demonstrate the greatest unmet need for a more coordinated system of care.

Authorizes a grantee to use amounts provided only for: (1) direct expenses associated with achieving greater integration of a health care delivery system to directly provide or ensure the provision of a broad range of culturally competent services; and (2) direct patient care and service expansions to fill identified or documented gaps within an integrated delivery system.</summary>
