Requires the submission of such information to continue to apply to a Presidential library fundraising organization during the lifetime of the President whose archives benefit from such fundraising.\n\nRequires the Archivist to make such information available to the public through the Internet (or a successor technology readily available to the public) as soon as is practicable after each quarterly filing. Requires that such information be made available without a fee or other access charge, in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable database.\n\nProhibits knowing and willful submissions of false information or omissions of material information by contributors or the fundraising organization. Prescribes criminal penalties for violation of such prohibitions.\n\nProhibits any person from knowingly and willfully: (1) making a contribution described above in the name of another person; (2) permitting his or her name to be used to effect such a contribution; and (3) accepting such a contribution that is made by one person in the name of another person. Prescribes penalties for violation of such prohibition.\n\nRequires the Archivist to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act.\n\nMakes this Act: (1) applicable to an organization established to raise funds for creating, maintaining, expanding, or conducting activities at a Presidential archival depository or any facilities related to such a depository; and (2) only applicable with respect to contributions (whether monetary or in-kind) made after enactment of this Act."
