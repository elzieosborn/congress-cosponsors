  <summary date="2007-05-16T18:52:32Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in a neighborhood demonstration project to: (1) demonstrate the potential for infiltration of stormwater runoff to recharge groundwater by retrofitting sites in the Los Angeles area with features designed to reflect state-of-the-art best management practices for water conservation, pollution reduction and treatment, and habitat restoration; and (2) assess the potential new water supply yield based on increased infiltration and the value of the new water. Limits the federal share to 25% of the project's cost. Terminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this Act 10 years after its enactment.</summary>
