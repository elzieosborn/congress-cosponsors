Requires that, if any federal public land is permanently closed to recreational shooting, new acres of federal public land of comparable size and a reasonable distance from the closed location be designated for recreational shooting and be opened for the number of user-days equal to those available at the closed area.\n\nRequires the Director to submit annual reports describing: (1) any federal public land that was closed to recreational shooting; (2) the reason for the closure; and (3) federal public land that was opened to recreational hunting so as to compensate for the closure of such land.\n\nPermits states a right of action for failure of the Director to comply with this Act."
