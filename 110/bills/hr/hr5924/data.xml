  <summary date="2009-10-01T21:07:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Emergency Nursing Supply Relief Act - Amends the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 to lift the numerical limitations for employment based immigrants (and accompanying family members) for nurses and physical therapists until September 30, 2011, subject to a cap.

Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to impose a fee upon each petitioning employer who uses such a visa to provide employment for an alien as a professional nurse.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS), acting through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to award a grant each fiscal year to each eligible nursing school that applies and meets specified requirements to increase the number of nursing faculty and students at the school.

Establishes in the Treasury's general fund a Domestic Nursing Enhancement Account.

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) direct the Secretary to allow an eligible alien (and spouse or child) to reside in a candidate country (defined to include a lower middle income country or one experiencing a natural disaster) during the period the alien is working there as a health care worker; and (2) make inadmissible an alien seeking entry into the United States to perform labor as a health care worker unless the alien attests that he or she does not have an outstanding obligation to the alien's government or country of residence, subject to a waiver.

Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a partnership program to award grants to eligible entities to carry out comprehensive programs to provide education to nurses and create a pipeline to nursing for incumbent ancillary health care workers who wish to advance their careers.</summary>
