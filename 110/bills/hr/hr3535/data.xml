  <summary date="2008-01-30T17:59:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Homebuyer's Protection Act of 2007 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require a creditor to establish, in an insured depository institution, an escrow or impound account for payment of taxes and hazard insurance at the time of the consummation of a subprime mortgage transaction.

Requires such account to remain in existence for as long as the subprime mortgage is outstanding.

Requires creditors, before consummating a consumer credit transaction involving an impound, trust, or escrow account, to provide the following written disclosures: (1) that an escrow or impound account will be established; (2) the amount required to fund such account; (3) the amount in the initial year of estimated taxes and hazard insurance premiums; and (4) the estimated monthly amount payable for taxes and hazard insurance.

Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 to extend its appraisal requirements to all real estate related financial transactions, not only those that are federally related.</summary>
