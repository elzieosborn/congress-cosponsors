Prohibits class actions. Immunizes from civil or criminal liability a person or entity who takes action in good faith reliance on verification system information.\n\nSets forth employer verification requirements with respect to an affirmative defense to liability for employment of unauthorized workers, including revision of attestation and retention of verification form provisions.\n\nPlaces limits on the collection and use of data from the verification system.\n\nExpands the employment eligibility verification system to include: (1) previously hired individuals; and (2) recruitment and referral.\n\nProvides for: (1) voluntary employer verification utilizing such system two years after enactment of this Act for previously hired individuals; (2) mandatory employer verification three years after enactment of this Act by federal, state, and local governments, and the military for employees not verified under such system working at federal, state or local government buildings, military bases, nuclear energy sites, weapons sites, airports, or critical infrastructure sites; and (3) mandatory employer verification six years after enactment of this Act for all employees not previously verified under such system.\n\nAmends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to extend the E-Verify program (formerly the basic pilot program) until two years after enactment of this Act.\n\nApplies employment eligibility verification requirements to labor service agencies.\n\nRevises civil and criminal penalty provisions.\n\nEstablishes in the Treasury the Employment Verification Compensation Fund.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a publicly available contractor database.\n\nRequires the Commissioner to report to Congress on Social Security card-based verification, including requirements for: (1) durable and machine-readable cards; (2) a unified database that specifies work authorizations; and (3) employer verification of new hires using the new Social Security cards and an electronic mechanism to seek verification.\n\nAuthorizes the Commissioner (subject to limits) to carry out verification responsibilities under this Act. Prohibits funds from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund from being used to carry out such responsibilities.\n\nSets forth other reporting requirements by the Secretary and the Commissioner."
