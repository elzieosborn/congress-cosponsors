Tule River Tribe Water Development Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, by the later of two years after funds are appropriated for this Act or the signing of a reserved water rights settlement agreement by the Tule River Tribe of California and other settling water users, to complete a feasibility study to evaluate alternatives for a domestic, commercial, municipal, industrial, and irrigation water supply for the Tule River Tribe of the Tule River Reservation.

Prohibits any project conducted in relation to that study from providing water supplies for any other Tribal casino, except: (1) the casino in its current form and dimensions operated by the Tribe on the Tule River Reservation; and (2) any lodging, dining, entertainment, meeting space, parking, or other similar facilities which may be constructed in the future in support of current, or any future expansion of, on-Reservation gaming activities.</summary>
