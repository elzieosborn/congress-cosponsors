Authorizes specified exemptions.\n\nDirects the Secretary and the Commissioner, upon a food item's failure to provide the assured safety level, to prohibit the importation of any similar food item produced by the same person in the same country until the Secretary or the Commissioner inspects the production place and determines that sufficient corrective steps have been taken.\n\nRequires: (1) heightened inspections for three years following the removal of a food item's import prohibition; and (2) inspection-related user fees on foods imported into the United States. Authorizes fee waiver or reduction.\n\nProvides: (1) a private right of action against an importer; and (2) criminal penalties against an importer who knowingly imports a non-complying food item."
