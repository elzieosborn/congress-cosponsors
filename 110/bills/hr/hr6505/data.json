Sets forth: (1) exceptions to such prohibition (including for certain charitable organizations that provide service capuchin monkeys to authorized permanently disabled individuals); and (2) civil and criminal penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other relevant federal and state agencies, to issue regulations to implement the Captive Wildlife Safety Act.\n\nAuthorizes additional appropriations to the Secretary for FY2009 to hire additional law enforcement personnel of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to enforce the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981."
