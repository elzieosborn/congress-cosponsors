Allows testing requirements to be satisfied by independent testing, evaluation, or audits.\n\n(Sec. 6) Requires the Director to report to Congress on a summary of information security breaches reported by agencies to the Director and the federal information security incident center.\n\nRequires the Director to oversee the establishment of policies, procedures, and standards for agencies to follow in the event of a breach involving the disclosure of personally identifiable information, specifically including: (1) a requirement for timely notice to those individuals whose information could be compromised, except when the breach does not create a reasonable risk of identity theft, fraud, or other unlawful conduct or of other harm to the individual; (2) guidance regarding whether additional special actions are necessary and appropriate, including data breach analysis, fraud resolution services, identify theft insurance, and credit protection or monitoring services; and (3) a requirement for the timely reporting of such breaches to the Director and federal information security center.\n\nRequires agency heads to delegate to their Chief Information Officer the authority to ensure compliance and to enforce information security requirements, including developing and maintaining an inventory of personal computers laptops or hardware containing personally identifiable information.\n\nRequires agencies to include in their information security programs: (1) procedures for notifying individuals whose personally identifiable information may have been compromised or accessed following a breach; and (2) procedures for the timely reporting of breaches involving personally identifiable information.\n\nIncludes among functions of Chief Human Capital Officers the prescription of policies and procedures for exit interviews of employees, including a full accounting of all federal personal property assigned.\n\n(Sec. 7) Requires agency heads to implement expeditiously and revise as necessary a plan to ensure the security and privacy of information collected or maintained by or on behalf of agencies from the risks posed by certain peer-to-peer file sharing programs. Requires the Comptroller General to review and report to specified congressional committees on the adequacy of such plans.\n\n(Sec. 8) Requires audits (currently, evaluations are required) of agency information programs and practices to determine whether information security controls are effective.\n\n(Sec. 9) Amends the E-Government Act of 2002 to require the Director to develop best practices for agencies to follow in conducting privacy impact assessments."
