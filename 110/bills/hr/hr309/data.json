Provides for such receipts to be available for expenditure for within a unit for the following purposes only: (1) landscape restoration; (2) interpretive services; (3) eradication of disease, insects, or invasive species; or (4) fuel load reduction.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit a report containing the results of such demonstration program, including: (1) a detailed accounting of the receipts generated in each unit by such program; (2) the expenditure by each unit of those receipts; and (3) any resource or other impacts, positive or negative, on each participating unit.\n\nTerminates the authority granted to the Secretary to carry out the demonstration program under this Act four years after enactment of this Act."
