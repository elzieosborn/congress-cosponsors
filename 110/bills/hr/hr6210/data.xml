  <summary date="2008-07-18T17:43:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Health Options Program Act of 2008 or the SHOP Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to designate an office within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to administer a health insurance program for small businesses and self-employed individuals to purchase health insurance coverage meeting certain requirements.

Establishes a Small Business Health Board to monitor the implementation of the program and make recommendations for improvements.

Requires the Administrator of the program to: (1) enter into contracts with health insurance issuers to provide health insurance coverage under this Act; and (2) enter into agreements with entities to serve as navigators to provide information about the program and assist in enrollment.

Requires a participating employer to ensure that each eligible employee has an opportunity to enroll in a plan.

Sets forth requirements for health plans offered under this Act. Requires the Administrator to contract with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to study the rating requirements, administrative procedures, and standards of external and internal review that apply to such plans and to health insurance purchased in the small group markets in the states and to develop recommendations concerning rating requirements.

Sets forth premium-setting rules for plans under this Act.

Allows a state to prohibit participation in this program if the state offers alternative health benefit plans.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for small employers for qualified employee health insurance expenses under this Act.</summary>
