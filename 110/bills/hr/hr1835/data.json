Requires the report to discuss the concerns of private landowners within the existing boundaries of the Recreation Area.\n\nInstructs the Secretary, as part of evaluating each alternative considered under such study, to estimate the impact of implementing the alternative on staffing and other potential costs to federal, state, and local agencies and other organizations."
