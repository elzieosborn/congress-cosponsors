Security Council sanctions against Iran; (2) implemented an export control regime in accordance with international standards and has implemented legislative and functional actions to target the logistical and financial networks that support terrorist organizations; (3) terminated all related cooperation between any UAE national and the government of Iran, any Iranian national, or any Iranian-controlled entity, and has prosecuted any such UAE national, and (4) not engaged in or condoned activities that violate the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, and other applicable U.S. law.
