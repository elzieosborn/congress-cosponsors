  <summary date="2008-11-19T13:44:01Z" status="Passed House amended">Next Generation Radiation Screening Act of 2008 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require: (1) the Director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to enter into an agreement regarding the minimum required functionality for the deployment of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal monitors (ASP) by CBP; and (2) the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide Congress with the signed memorandum of understanding between the Office and CBP.

Directs the Secretary to develop quantitative metrics that demonstrate any significant increased operational effectiveness of deploying ASP in primary and secondary screening sites. Requires such metrics to include: (1) a quantitative definition of "significant increase in operational effectiveness"; (2) all relevant threat materials; (3) all relevant masking scenarios; and (4) cost-benefit analysis in accordance with the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Permits the Secretary, in determining whether to certify that ASP shows a significant increase in operational effectiveness, to consider: (1) relevant reports on ASP from the Government Accountability Office (GAO); and (2) assessments of ASP by the Independent Review Team led by the Homeland Security Institute in consultation with the National Archives.

Authorizes appropriations to the Director for FY2009 and for each subsequent fiscal year for the Securing the Cities Initiative.</summary>
