  <summary date="2007-08-14T16:12:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Television Freedom Act of 2007 - Requires statutory licensing for a satellite carrier's secondary transmission into a television broadcast station's adjacent market if the satellite carrier also makes secondary transmissions into that adjacent market of the adjacent market's television broadcast stations. Defines "adjacent market," for both commercial and noncommercial television broadcast stations, as a market area adjacent to, and at least partially in the same state as, the designated market area in which the station is located.

Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow such secondary transmissions.

Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to revise related regulations concerning network nonduplication protection, syndicated exclusivity protection, and sports blackout protection to permit such retransmission.</summary>
