  <summary date="2009-01-09T22:23:51Z" status="Introduced in House">America's Wildlife Heritage Act - Sets forth requirements concerning the maintenance of viable populations of existing native and desired non-native species within each planning area in the National Forest System's or the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) public lands.

Directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to adopt and implement a comprehensive monitoring program for determining the status and trends of wildlife populations on System and BLM lands.

Requires the Secretaries to coordinate the management of species populations in planning areas of the System and the BLM with the management of such populations on lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System and National Park System, and with other federal agencies, state fish and wildlife agencies, tribes, local governments, and non-governmental organizations engaged in species conservation.</summary>
