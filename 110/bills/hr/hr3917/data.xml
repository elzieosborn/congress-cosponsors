Denies the Secretary of the Treasury authority to prescribe any regulations that would limit or prohibit the export, melting, or treatment of the one-cent coin until such time as the Secretary first issues a one-cent coin with a different metallic content than the one-cent coins issued as of the date of enactment of this Act.</summary>
