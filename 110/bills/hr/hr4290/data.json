Prohibits: (1) the disclosure outside the federal government of the test results and associated data that are trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information without the consent of the person or entity for whom the tests are performed; and (2) fees from exceeding the amount necessary to recoup the costs involved.\n\nDirects the Under Secretary to submit to Congress: (1) a report detailing a plan for operating such program; and (2) an annual report on the facilities that have collected fees, the partnerships formed, and the testing conducted.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to submit to Congress an assessment of such program."
