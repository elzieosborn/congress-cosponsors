    "text": "Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2007 - (Sec. 2) Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide specially adaptive housing assistance for disabled members of the Armed Forces residing temporarily in housing owned by a family member if such military member suffers from a disability which is permanent and total in nature and is the result of an injury incurred or disease contracted or aggravated in the line of duty in active military service.\n\n(Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to carry out the Department of Veterans Affairs Visual Impairment and Orientation and Mobility Professionals Scholarship Program to increase the supply of qualified blind rehabilitation specialists for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the country. Outlines eligibility requirements, including being a full- or part-time student in such fields of education or training. Requires: (1) full-time scholarship recipients to serve full-time in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in such field of clinical practice for three years during the six-year period following completion of such education or training; and (2) part-time recipients to serve a proportionately reduced period, but not less than one year. Limits to $15,000 per academic year the maximum scholarship for full-time participants. Requires pro rata repayment for unserved periods of obligated service.\n\n(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary to include, within a currently-required annual report concerning veterans' reemployment rights: (1) the number of cases reviewed by the Secretary of Defense under the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve of the Department of Defense; and (2) an indication of which of the reported cases are disability-related.\n\n(Sec. 5) Increases from 15 to 16 the number of members on the Advisory Committee on Veterans Employment, Training, and Employer Outreach."
