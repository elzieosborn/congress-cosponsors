Includes among the Council's activities: (1) supporting the creation of local labor-management partnership councils that promote partnership efforts; (2) collecting and disseminating information about and providing guidance on such efforts; (3) using the expertise of individuals, inside and outside the federal government, to foster partnership arrangements in the executive branch; and (4) proposing statutory changes to improve the civil service to better serve the public and carry out the mission of the various agencies.

Requires the President to designate a Council Chairperson.

Requires the President to direct the head of each agency which is subject to labor-management relations provisions or any other authority permitting employees to select an exclusive representative, to: (1) create labor-management partnerships by forming labor-management committees or councils at appropriate levels or adapting existing committees or councils if such groups exist; (2) involve employees and their representatives as full partners with management representatives to improve the civil service to better serve the public and carry out the mission of the agency; (3) provide systemic training of appropriate employees in consensual methods of dispute resolution; (4) negotiate, at the request of the labor organization, on specified subjects and instruct subordinate officials to do the same; and (5) evaluate progress and improvements in organizational performance resulting from such labor-management partnerships.</summary>
