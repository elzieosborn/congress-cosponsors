  <summary date="2008-06-10T15:23:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Refinery Permit Process Schedule Act - Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), upon the request of a state governor, or in the case of Native American tribes or tribal territories, the designated leader of the tribe or tribal community, to provide financial assistance to hire additional personnel to assist the state or tribe or tribal community with expertise in fields relevant to consideration of federal refinery authorizations.

Requires a federal agency responsible for refinery authorization to provide, upon the request of a state governor, or in the case of Native American tribes or tribal territories, the designated leader of the tribe or tribal community, technical, legal, or other nonfinancial assistance to facilitate state or tribal consideration of such authorizations.

Directs the President to appoint a federal coordinator to facilitate such authorizations.

Requires the coordinator, upon the request of an applicant seeking a federal refinery authorization, to establish a memorandum of agreement, executed by relevant federal and state agencies, setting forth the most expeditious coordinated schedule possible for completion of all such authorizations.

Instructs the President to designate at least three closed military installations as potentially suitable for the construction of a refinery. Requires that at least one such site be designated as potentially suitable for construction of a refinery to refine biomass in order to produce biofuel.

Requires the redevelopment authority, in preparing or revising the redevelopment plan for each such designated installation, to consider the feasibility and practicability of siting a refinery on the installation.

Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal certain requirements regarding refinery revitalization.</summary>
