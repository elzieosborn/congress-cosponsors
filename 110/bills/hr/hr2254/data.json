Grants extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute violations of this Act. Imposes a fine and minimum prison term of 25 years for violations (life imprisonment for violations resulting in death).\n\nRequires the Secretary of State to direct the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations and representatives to bilateral and multilateral fora to seek international recognition that the transfer of nuclear weapons, devices, material, or technology for terrorist purposes is a crime against humanity."
