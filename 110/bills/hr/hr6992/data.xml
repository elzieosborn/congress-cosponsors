  <summary date="2008-12-16T21:42:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Reclamation Title Transfer Act of 2008 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to: (1) identify and analyze the potential for public benefits from the transfer out of federal ownership of eligible reclamation projects or facilities; and (2) facilitate such transfer to promote more efficient management of water and water-related facilities.

Authorizes the Secretary to convey title in any such facility to a qualifying entity (including an agency of a state or local government or Indian tribe, a municipal corporation, or another entity such as a water district), provided that: (1) the Secretary retains any associated mineral interests; (2) water interests are conveyed by written agreement; and (3) interests in eligible facilities are conveyed by an agreement developed in consultation with the facility's existing power customers.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) complete all actions required under all applicable laws (including environmental and historic preservation laws) before conveying land and facilities; and (2) establish criteria for determining whether facilities are eligible for title transfer, including requirements that a qualifying entity agrees to accept title to the property and that the proposed title transfer will not have an unmitigated significant effect on the environment.

Shields the United States from liability for any act, omission, or occurrence based on its prior ownership or operation of the conveyed property. Requires a recipient entity to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in its operation of conveyed property.</summary>
