  <summary date="2007-10-05T15:27:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Skin Cancer Prevention, Education, and Consumer Right-To-Know Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a drug that is a sunscreen product whose labeling violates this Act to be adulterated.

Prohibits the labeling of a drug that is a sunscreen product that fails to meet the standards adopted under this Act from: (1) describing the product using the term "broad-spectrum"; or (2) including a specified symbol adopted to indicate broad-spectrum.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt: (1) a standard for broad-spectrum protection in sunscreen products; and (2) an easily recognized symbol for inclusion in the labeling of sunscreen products meeting such standards.

Sets forth minimum standards that the Secretary shall adopt for such broad-spectrum protection, including a minimum ratio of UVA protection factor to sun protection factor, a minimum level of UVB radiation protection, and specified truth in labeling requirements. Requires sun protection factors to be measured using standardized, reproducible testing methods that take photo-degradation into account.

Requires the Secretary to implement an education campaign identifying the risks posed by sun exposure without the use of a sunscreen providing broad-spectrum protection.</summary>
