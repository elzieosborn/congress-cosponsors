  <summary date="2008-03-31T19:52:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 to condition further increases in the federal minimum wage applicable to the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa on a determination by the Secretary of Labor that such increases will not have an adverse impact on any further increases on living standards and rates of employment in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa.

Requires the Secretary to make the determinations each year 60 days before the scheduled increase in such minimum wage and to publish it in the Federal Register.

Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress biennially (currently, within eight months after the enactment of such Act) on the impact of: (1) such minimum wage increases; and (2) any further increases on living standards and rates of employment in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa.</summary>
