    "text": "Social Security Number Protection Act of 2007 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to make it unlawful for any person, except in certain circumstances, to: (1) intentionally display the Social Security number of another individual on a website generally accessible to the public or providing an individual with access to another individual's Social Security number through the Internet; (2) require an individual who is a customer of or member associated with such person to use the individual's Social Security number as a password for access to any good or service, including any account or protected access website; or (3) display any individual's Social Security number on any membership or identity card.\n\n Amends SSA title II to make it unlawful for any person to sell or purchase a Social Security number, without an individual's voluntary written consent, in a manner that violates a regulation promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), except in certain circumstances related to law enforcement, national security, public health, or emergency safety and health. Prescribes requirements for such a sale or purchase in other circumstances related to consumer credit verification or specified research.\n\nRequires the Commission to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of banning use of the Social Security number as a primary means of authenticating identity or verifying it for commercial transactions. Requires the study also to examine possible alternatives to Social Security numbers for such purposes and uses."
