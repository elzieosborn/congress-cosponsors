  <summary date="2007-07-26T18:33:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Passport and Travel Cost Reimbursement Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of State to refund to a U.S. citizen, upon refund application: (1) passport processing fees for a passport applied for in 2007 if processing took 12 or more weeks for a regular application or three or more weeks for an expedited application; and (2) international air travel costs (economy or comparable, minus any airline refund) for U.S.-departing flights missed as a result of such processing delays.

Authorizes the Secretary to provide additional assistance for an extraordinary hardship.

Prohibits the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security from implementing a specified plan for a single implementation date for sea and land borders until they have certified to Congress that Department of State passport agencies are able to process passport applications with minimal disruption.</summary>
