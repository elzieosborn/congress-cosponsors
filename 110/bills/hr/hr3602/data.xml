  <summary date="2007-12-07T17:46:15Z" status="Introduced in House">TV Consumer Freedom Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow any cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor to retransmit the signal of a broadcasting station, or any part thereof, only with the express authority of that station (thereby removing authority under current law for such retransmission in the case of the carriage of local television signals by satellite carriers and cable operators). Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to commence a rulemaking proceeding to revise regulations governing the exercise by broadcast stations of the right to grant such consent.

Repeals federal provisions requiring cable operators to carry the signals of local commercial television stations and qualified noncommercial educational television stations. Terminates upon the enactment of this Act all FCC regulations requiring television receivers sold in the United States to include particular types of features or functions, or specifying the type of technology to be used to provide such features or functions. Grants a satellite carrier, notwithstanding any injunction issued under specified provisions, a statutory license to provide a secondary transmission of a performance or display of a work embodied in a primary transmission made by a network station.</summary>
