Authorizes the Director of the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth to award grants to: (1) demonstrate how telehealth technologies can be used to expand access to, coordinate, and improve the quality of health care services, and to improve and expand the training of health care providers, the quality of health information available, and efforts to eliminate health care disparities; and (2) provide oral health services to patients who reside in rural areas.

Directs the Secretary to establish a Joint Working Group on Telehealth to: (1) identify, monitor, and coordinate federal telehealth projects, data sets, and programs; (2) analyze how telehealth systems are expanding access to health care services, education, and information; (3) analyze the quality of the telehealth services delivered; (4) analyze how telehealth systems can improve health care quality and eliminate disparities; and (5) make recommendations for coordinating federal and state efforts to increase access to health services, education, and information in rural and urban medically underserved areas.</summary>
