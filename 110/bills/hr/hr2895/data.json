Requires HUD to report to Congress regarding such requirements.\n\nSpecifies prohibited uses of grants amounts, including: (1) political activities; (2) advocacy; and (3) counseling services.\n\nPrescribes affordable housing criteria for: (1) rental housing; (2) owner-occupied housing; and (3) priority for families on section 8 rental assistance or public housing waiting list for 12 months or longer.\n\nPrescribes requirements for the tracking of funds to ensure grantee and recipient accountability.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a clearinghouse of information, made available over the Internet, relating to green building techniques to provide grantees and Fund recipients information regarding use of Fund amounts in a manner that increases the efficiency of buildings and their use of energy, water, and materials, and reduces building impacts on human health and the environment, through better siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and removal.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this Act allows any payments for any individual or head of household that is not a legal resident."
