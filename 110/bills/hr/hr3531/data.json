States that such provision shall not be construed to require such personnel to: (1) report the identity of a victim of, or a witness to, a criminal offense to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); or (2) arrest such victim or witness for an immigration-related violation.\n\nDirects DHS to establish an immigration-related training manual for state and local law enforcement personnel.\n\nProvides financial assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies for immigration enforcement assistance.\n\nContinues the institutional removal program and expands it to all states.\n\nAuthorizes permanent appropriations for the state criminal alien assistance program.\n\nProvides for the listing of immigration violators in the National Crime Information Center Database."
