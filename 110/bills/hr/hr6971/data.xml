  <summary date="2008-11-20T21:48:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Public Service Scholarship Act of 2008 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a Public Service Scholarship program authorizing the Secretary of Education to make grants to states for scholarships to exceptionally able students who show promise of continued excellence and agree to serve as federal employees for at least five years.

Allocates scholarship funds among states on the basis of each state's share of the nation's population of five- through 17-year olds; but sets the minimum allocation at a level allowing grantees to award at least 10 scholarships per year.</summary>
