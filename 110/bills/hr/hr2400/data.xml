  <summary date="2007-10-04T15:34:07Z" status="Passed House amended">Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act - (Sec. 2) Directs the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish an integrated ocean and coastal mapping program for the Great Lakes and coastal state waters, the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone, and the U.S. continental shelf that enhances ecosystem approaches in decision-making for conservation and management of marine resources and habitats, establishes research priorities, supports the siting of research and other platforms, advances safety of navigation, and advances ocean and coastal science.

(Sec. 3) Directs the Administrator to convene or use an existing interagency committee on ocean and coastal mapping to implement such program and to coordinate federal ocean and coastal mapping and surveying activities with other federal efforts (including the Digital Coast, Geospatial One-Stop, and the Federal Geographic Data Committee), international mapping activities, coastal states, user groups, and nongovernmental entities. Authorizes the Administrator to convene an ocean and coastal mapping advisory panel consisting of representatives from nongovernmental entities to provide input regarding activities of the committee.

(Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator to develop a plan for an integrated ocean and coastal mapping initiative within NOAA that: (1) identifies all ocean and coastal mapping programs within NOAA, establishing priorities; (2) encourages the development of innovative ocean and coastal mapping technologies and applications through research and development (R&amp;D) cooperative agreements at joint or cooperative research institutes or centers and with other nongovernmental entities; and (3) documents available and developing technologies, best practices in data processing and distribution, and leveraging opportunities with other federal agencies, coastal states, and nongovernmental entities.

Authorizes the Administrator to establish joint ocean and coastal mapping centers (including a joint hydrographic center) of excellence in institutions of higher education to conduct specified activities, including: (1) research and development of innovative ocean and coastal mapping technologies, equipment, and data products; and (2) mapping of the U.S. outer continental shelf. Requires the Administrator to continue developing a strategy for expanding contracting with nongovernmental entities.

(Sec. 5) Requires a biannual report from the Committee to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives on progress made in implementing this Act.

(Sec. 6) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
