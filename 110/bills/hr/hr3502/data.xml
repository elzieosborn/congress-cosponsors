  <summary date="2008-01-24T21:08:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Wounded Warriors Commission Implementation Act of 2007 - Outlines Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) roles with respect to the retirement for disability of members of the Armed Forces (members).

Eliminates the 30% required disability rating before a member may be retired for disability. Qualifies each member retired for a disability to a lifetime payment based on the member's rank and years of military service.

Authorizes transition payments to members retired due to combat-related injuries.

Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay annual bonuses to veterans enrolled in approved rehabilitation programs.

Directs the Secretary to pay to members retired due to combat-related injuries: (1) quality-of-life payments to members not receiving transition payments; and (2) earnings-loss payments to members who received, but are no longer qualified for, transition payments.

Presumes post-traumatic stress disorder to be service-connected, and therefore compensable under veterans' disability compensation provisions.

Provides extended benefits under TRICARE (a DOD managed care program) for the primary caregivers of members who incur a serious injury or illness while on active duty.

Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to entitle to 26 workweeks of leave per year an employee who is the primary caregiver of a member who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is in medical hold or holdover status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness.</summary>
