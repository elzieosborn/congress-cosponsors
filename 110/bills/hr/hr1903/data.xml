  <summary date="2007-07-13T20:17:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Post-Prostate Cancer Treatment Equity Act of 2007 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Public Health Service Act to require a group health plan that provides medical and surgical benefits with respect to prostate cancer treatment to provide coverage for: (1) all stages of reconstructive prosthetic urology surgery; and (2) prostheses and physical complications of prostatectomy. Requires plans to provide notice of the coverage.

Prohibits a group health plan from: (1) denying to a patient eligibility or continued eligibility solely to avoid the requirements of this Act; or (2) penalizing or otherwise reducing or limiting the reimbursement of a provider or providing incentives to induce such provider to provide care to a participant or beneficiary in a manner inconsistent with this Act.

Applies such requirements to coverage offered in the individual market.</summary>
