  <summary date="2008-11-24T22:25:16Z" status="Passed House amended">Calling Card Consumer Protection Act - (Sec. 3) Requires providers or distributors of prepaid calling cards, including cards that use interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or a successor protocol, to clearly and conspicuously disclose information about: (1) the provider's name, customer service number, and hours of service; (2) the card's number of minutes or dollar value; (3) per minute rates or a toll-free number to obtain rates; (4) fees and charges; (5) time period limits, any predetermined decrease in value over a period of time, and expiration dates; and (6) refund and recharge policies.

(Sec. 4) Treats a violation as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act and requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce this Act. Gives the FTC, for this Act, jurisdiction over common carriers subject to the Communications Act of 1934, notwithstanding any other provision of law.

(Sec. 5) Allows civil enforcement actions to be brought, except when an FTC action is pending, by a state attorney general, a state utilities commission, or a consumer protection agency for an injunction, to enforce this Act, to obtain damages, restitution, or other compensation on behalf of state residents, or for other relief. Allows actions under state laws.

Shields a distributor who is a retail seller of prepaid cards and who, with respect to such cards, is exclusively engaged in point-of-sale transactions from liability for damages unless the distributor acted with actual knowledge that the act or practice giving rise to the action is unfair or deceptive and is unlawful under this Act.

(Sec. 7) Prohibits a state, after final regulations are promulgated under this Act, from establishing or continuing in effect any provision of law that prescribes prepaid card disclosure requirements unless those requirements are identical to those in this Act.

(Sec. 8) Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the effectiveness of this Act and its required disclosures.</summary>
