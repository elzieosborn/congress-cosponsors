Declares that this Act does not repeal or modify any federal, state, territorial, or local law creating a special right or preference concerning employment for a veteran.\n\nProvides for the construction of this Act with regard to: (1) enforcement by employers of rules and policies; (2) sexual harassment; (3) certain shared facilities such as showers or dressing facilities; (4) the construction of new or additional facilities; and (5) dress and grooming standards.\n\nProhibits the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from collecting statistics from covered entities on actual or perceived gender identity or compelling the collection by covered entities of such statistics.\n\nProvides for enforcement, including giving the EEOC, the Librarian of Congress, the Attorney General, and U.S. courts the same enforcement powers as they have under specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, and other specified laws.\n\nAllows actions and proceedings against state governments and, subject to limitation, the federal government."
