  <summary date="2008-03-20T19:30:45Z" status="Introduced in House">National Diabetes Coordinator Act of 2008 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish within the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the position of National Diabetes Coordinator, whose duties shall be to: (1) serve as the Secretary's principal advisor on reducing the rates of diabetes and its complications; (2) develop a measurement for the incidence of diabetes; (3) develop and coordinate implementation of a national strategy to reduce the incidence, progression, and impact of diabetes and its complications; (4) provide leadership and coordination to ensure that diabetes-related programs and policies of HHS are coordinated internally and with those of relevant federal, state, and local agencies with a goal of avoiding duplication of effort, maximizing impact, and marshaling all government resources; and (5) coordinate public and private resources to develop and lead a public awareness campaign regarding the prevention and control of diabetes and its complications.

Requires reports to the President: (1) from the HHS Secretary on a national strategy to reduce the incidence, progression, and impact of diabetes and its complications; (2) from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on negotiations with health plans to include appropriate standards and activities to reduce risk factors for diabetes and encourage prevention and early treatment; and (3) from the Secretary of Agriculture on ways in which food programs and nutritional support can be better targeted at concerns specific to those at risk for diabetes or those already diagnosed whose complications could be reduced by more effective diet.</summary>
