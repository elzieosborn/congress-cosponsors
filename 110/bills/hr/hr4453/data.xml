  <summary date="2008-03-05T22:43:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Underage Drinking Prevention Act of 2007 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) understanding which programs are effective in reducing underage drinking will maximize scarce federal resources and help confront underage drinking in a more effective, cost-efficient manner; (2) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration should explore ways to expand and improve evaluation efforts; and (3) federal agencies should strive to evaluate all federally funded underage drinking programs and modify programs as needed to reach maximum effectiveness.

Requires the Director of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Programs to award grants to states and local governments to implement and evaluate enforcement and public education programs aimed at reducing the provision of alcohol by social sources to underage drinkers as part of the Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws Program.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as Chair of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking, to: (1) work with members of that Committee to improve federal data collection by ensuring that federally funded surveys related to underage drinking collect and report data in a consistent manner; and (2) establish a federal data improvement committee.

Requires the Secretary of Education to: (1) award grants on a competitive basis to local educational agencies to develop and implement innovative and effective programs to increase parental awareness and involvement in reducing underage drinking in elementary and secondary schools; and (2) identify existing, effective, national programs that increase parent-child interaction to prevent underage drinking and disseminate that information to such agencies for replication at the local level.</summary>
