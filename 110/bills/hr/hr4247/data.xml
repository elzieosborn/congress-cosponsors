Increases the amount of basic educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill for members of the Selected Reserve and reserve personnel supporting contingency operations.

Entitles a federal employee who is a member of a reserve component to receive the difference in pay between military compensation and civilian compensation during periods of active duty exceeding 30 days.

Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to reimburse states or local governments for 50% of the civilian compensation paid by such governments to equalize military and civilian pay. Increases the reimbursement rate to 100% if active duty extends beyond nine months.
