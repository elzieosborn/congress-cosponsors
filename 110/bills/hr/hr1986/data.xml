Requires a prospective contractor submitting an offer to an agency to include a certification as to whether such contractor has, within the preceding three years, been convicted of, or suffered a civil judgment for, violating any tax law or failing to pay any tax or has been notified of any delinquent taxes or unsatisfied tax liens.</summary>
