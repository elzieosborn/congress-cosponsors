    "text": "Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 - Title I: Enhancements to Civil Intellectual Property Laws - (Sec. 101) Amends federal copyright law to: (1) provide a safe harbor for copyright registrations that contain inaccurate information, unless there was knowledge of the inaccurate information and the inaccuracy of the information, if known, would have caused the Register of Copyrights to refuse registration; (2) provide that copyright registration requirements apply to civil (not criminal) infringement actions; and (3) require courts to issue protective orders to prevent disclosure of seized records relating to copyright infringement.\n\n(Sec. 104) Broadens the trademark infringement situations in which treble damages are allowed to include: (1) intentionally inducing another to violate a trademark; and (2) providing goods and services necessary to the commission of a violation with the intent that they be used in the violation. Doubles the minimum and maximum statutory damage limits for trademark infringement.\n\n(Sec. 106) Prohibits the importing (current law), as well as the exporting, of infringing copies of copyrighted works.\n\nTitle II: Enhancements to Criminal Intellectual Property Laws - (Sec. 201) Amends the federal criminal code with respect to intellectual property to: (1) revise criminal penalties for infringement of a copyright by permitting repeat felony violations to be interchangeable, for trafficking in counterfeit labels or packaging, and for causing serious bodily harm or death while trafficking in counterfeit goods or services; and (2) revise current civil and criminal forfeiture provisions for copyright infringement, as well as add new restitution and forfeiture provisions.\n\n(Sec. 203) Authorizes the United States Sentencing Commission to amend certain federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements regarding whether a defendant should receive an upward adjustment in the offense level on the grounds that exportation introduces infringing items into the stream of foreign commerce in a manner analogous to the manner in which manufacturing, importing, and uploading such items introduces them into the stream of commerce.\n\nTitle III: Coordination and Strategic Planning of Federal Effort Against Counterfeiting and Piracy - Subtitle A: Office of the United States Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative - (Sec. 301) Establishes within the Executive Office of the President the Office of the United States Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative (IP Enforcement Representative) to formulate a Joint Strategic Plan for combating counterfeiting and piracy of intellectual property and for coordinating national and international enforcement efforts to protect intellectual property rights. Prohibits the IP Enforcement Representative from controlling or directing any law enforcement agency in the exercise of its investigative or prosecutorial authority in particular cases. Establishes an interagency intellectual property enforcement advisory committee to develop the Joint Strategic Plan against counterfeiting and piracy under subtitle B of this title.\n\nSubtitle B: Joint Strategic Plan - (Sec. 321) Requires the IP Enforcement Representative to submit a Joint Strategic Plan against counterfeiting and piracy to the President and specified congressional committees every three years. Requires that the plan include programs to provide training and technical assistance to foreign governments to enhance those governments' efforts to enforce counterfeiting and piracy laws.\n\n(Sec. 322) Requires an annual report on the Office's activities to the President, Congress, and the people of the United States.\n\n(Sec. 323) Repeals provisions establishing the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council.\n\n(Sec. 324) Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title.\n\nTitle IV: International Enforcement and Coordination - (Sec. 401) Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to appoint at least 10 additional intellectual property attaches to work with foreign countries to combat counterfeiting and piracy of intellectual property.
