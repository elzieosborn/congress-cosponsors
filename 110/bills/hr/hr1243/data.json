Prohibits an increased collateral requirement with respect to the deferred loans.\n\nIncludes as a HUBZone (historically underutilized business zone) any area in which the President has declared a major disaster as a result of such hurricanes.\n\nAmends the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program Act of 1988 to make the small business competitive demonstration program (to test innovative small business procurement methods and procedures) inapplicable, for a conditional period, to any contract related to relief or reconstruction from such hurricanes."
