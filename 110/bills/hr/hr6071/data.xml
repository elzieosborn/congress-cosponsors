  <summary date="2008-07-15T22:07:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Care Consumer Protection Act of 2008 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require an issuer of group health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan that cancels or does not renew the coverage by reason of nonpayment of premiums to: (1) provide to the administrator of the plan and to each participant receiving coverage, during the 14-day period beginning on the date of such cancellation or non-renewal, written notice of the cancellation or non-renewal, the reason for such cancellation or non-renewal, and the right of reinstatement; and (2) reinstate the coverage as if it had not lapsed if the premiums due and such reasonable administrative fee as the state regulating such coverage may specify are paid to the issuer by not later than 60 days after the date the cancellation or non-renewal would otherwise have become effective.

Applies such requirement in the same manner to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in the individual market. Requires the notice to be provided to an association or other organization responsible for paying premiums as well as the individuals whose coverage is affected.</summary>
