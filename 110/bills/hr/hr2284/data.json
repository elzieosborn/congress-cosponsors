The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.)\n\n\n\nAmends the Small Business Act to authorize a Small Business Development Center in an eligible state to apply for an additional grant to be used solely to provide services to assist with outreach, development, and enhancement on Indian lands of small business startups and expansions owned by Indian tribe members, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Defines an \"eligible state\" as a state that has a combined population of Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians that comprises at least 1% of the state's total population. Prohibits any applicant from receiving more than $300,000 in such grants for one fiscal year. Authorizes appropriations for carrying out such additional assistance for FY2008-FY2010.\n\nRequires a Small Business Development Center receiving such a grant to request the advice of the local tribal organization on how best to provide assistance and where to locate satellite centers to provide such assistance."
