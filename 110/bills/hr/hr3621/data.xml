  <summary date="2007-12-19T16:49:44Z" status="Introduced in House">Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007 - Requires government agencies to prepare cost benefit analyses before entering any private contract of $100,000 or more to procure private sector architectural, engineering, and related services for a surface transportation project.

Provides for public disclosure of the results of such cost-benefit analysis if the government agency determines it is in the public interest to enter into the contract.

Authorizes the waiver of such requirements if it is determined that the government agency cannot perform the work to be conducted under the contract with existing or additional government employees because such work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature.</summary>
