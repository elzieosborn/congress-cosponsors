  <summary date="2007-11-28T22:51:39Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Authorizes the Archivist of the National Archives and Records Administration to make grants to contribute funds toward the establishment in Staunton, Virginia, of a library to preserve and make available materials related to the life of President Woodrow Wilson and to provide interpretive and educational services that communicate the meaning of his life.

Permits a grant to be made under this Act only from funds appropriated to the Archivist specifically for that purpose.

Requires non-federal matching funds of at least double the amount of the grant.

Specifies this Act's effect in relation to other Woodrow Wilson sites and museums.

Prohibits the use of grant amounts for the maintenance or operation of such library.

Bars the Archivist from: (1) having any involvement in the actual operation of the library, except at the request of the non-federal entity responsible for its operation; and (2) making such grants after September 30, 2011.</summary>
