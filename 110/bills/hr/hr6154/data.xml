  <summary date="2008-08-06T14:40:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration to establish a three-year pilot program to provide states with grants to reimburse commuters (except anyone already receiving mileage reimbursement from an employer) for the cost of gasoline for not more than 30 miles a day.

Specifies reimbursement levels based on a commuter vehicle's estimated fuel economy rating by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Requires such a reimbursement to be available to a commuter only if: (1) the average cost of gasoline across the country exceeds $2.75 per gallon; and (2) the state has sufficient funds to provide such reimbursement.</summary>
