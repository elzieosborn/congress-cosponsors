Defines \"qualified homeowner downpayment assistance\" as a gift of cash for the purpose of providing any downpayment for the purchase of a principal residence for a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $110,000 ($220,000 for joint returns), if: (1) such gift does not exceed 20% of 110 percent of the maximum principal obligation allowable; and (2) the purchase price of such property does not exceed 110 percent of such amount.\n\nDenies an income tax deduction to a donor of homeowner downpayment assistance who receives a direct financial benefit in connection with the purchase of a principal residence for which downpayment assistance was provided.\n\nAllows a gift tax exclusion for a homeowner downpayment gift."
