  <summary date="2007-07-12T21:09:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Homeownership Affordability Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deem qualified homeowner downpayment assistance as a charitable purpose for income, estate, and gift tax purposes. Defines "qualified homeowner downpayment assistance" as a gift of cash for the purpose of providing any downpayment for the purchase of a principal residence for a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $110,000 ($220,000 for joint returns), if: (1) such gift does not exceed 20% of 110 percent of the maximum principal obligation allowable; and (2) the purchase price of such property does not exceed 110 percent of such amount.

Denies an income tax deduction to a donor of homeowner downpayment assistance who receives a direct financial benefit in connection with the purchase of a principal residence for which downpayment assistance was provided.

Allows a gift tax exclusion for a homeowner downpayment gift.</summary>
