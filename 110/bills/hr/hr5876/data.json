Authorizes the Attorney General to file such a complaint on his or her own initiative regardless of whether such a referral has been made.\n\n(Sec. 5) Authorizes a private right of action in a U.S. district court for harm caused by a violation of minimum standards.\n\n(Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2013.\n\n(Sec. 8) Amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to establish additional eligibility requirements for grants to states to prevent child abuse and neglect at residential programs.
