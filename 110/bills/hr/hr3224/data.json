The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nDam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2007 - Amends the National Dam Safety Program Act to require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a program to provide grant assistance to states for use in rehabilitating publicly-owned dams that fail to meet minimum safety standards and pose an unacceptable risk to the public (deficient dams).\n\nSets forth provisions regarding procedures for grant awards and fund allocation. Requires: (1) states receiving grants under this Act to comply with standards applicable to financial contributions for emergency preparedness purposes under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and (2) FEMA to develop a risk-based priority system for identifying deficient dams for which such grants may be made. Limits the federal share of rehabilitation costs to 65%. Authorizes appropriations."
