(2) giving preferential treatment to projects that involve the investment or utilization of clean and efficient energy technologies; and (3) providing greater flexibility in supporting projects that involve the investment or utilization of clean and efficient energy technologies.\n\n Requires that OPIC include such activities (or an explanation for the lack of such activities) in its annual report.\n\n(Sec. 206) Requires the Director of the Trade and Development Agency to establish policies that fund, and give priority to, projects that involve clean and efficient energy technologies, particularly to countries that have the potential for significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDirects the President to include such activities in the annual Trade and Development Agency report.\n\n(Sec. 207) Authorizes the Secretary of State to establish a global climate change exchange program to strengthen research, educational exchange, and international cooperation with the aim of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and addressing global climate change.\n\nDirects the Secretary to report to the appropriate committees respecting such activities for each of FY2008-FY2012.\n\nAuthorizes FY2008-FY2012 appropriations.\n\n(Sec. 208) Directs the President to provide assistance to the Interagency Working Group to support a Clean Energy Technology Exports Initiative to: (1) leverage federal resources to enhance the export of U.S. clean energy technologies;

(2) seek contributions from foreign governments and private organizations to supplement funds made available under this title; (3) harness global expertise through collaborative partnerships with foreign governments and domestic and foreign private actors, by leveraging public and private capital, technology, expertise, and services towards innovative models to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions; (4) create a repository of best practices; and (5) promote the use of American-made clean and efficient energy technologies, processes, and services.\n\nDirects the Foundation to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees.\n\nAuthorizes FY2008-FY2012 appropriations."
