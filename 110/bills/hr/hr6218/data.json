    "text": "Requires the Secretary of Energy to make loan guarantees for renovation projects that: (1) are eligible under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 guarantee program as projects that avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies; and (2) will result in a building achieving the United States Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified level or meeting a comparable standard approved by the Secretary.\n\nProhibits such guarantees unless: (1) an appropriation for the cost has been made or the Secretary has received from the borrower and deposited into the Treasury a payment in full for the cost of the obligation; or (2) the Secretary determines that there is a reasonable prospect of repayment of the principal and interest on the obligation by the borrower. Limits the amount of loans that may be guaranteed at any one time to no more than $100 million.\n\n Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) the terms of obligations; (2) payments by the Secretary to the holders of the obligation for the borrower; and (3) actions by the Attorney General to recover unpaid principal and interest from a defaulting borrower."
