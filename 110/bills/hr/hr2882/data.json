Requires the Secretary to give priority to applicants that demonstrate a need or hardship. Allows the Secretary to consider such factors as the age and condition of the facilities, the need for facility beds in the community involved, and requirements imposed on the applicant to meet fire safety regulations under Medicare, Medicaid, other federal programs, or state or local licensing or building code standards."
