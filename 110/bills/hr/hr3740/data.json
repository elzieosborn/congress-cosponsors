    "text": "America Saving for Personal Investment, Retirement, and Education Act of 2007 or the ASPIRE Act of 2007 - Establishes a KIDS Account Fund in the Treasury.\n\nEstablishes within the Fund a Kids Investment and Development Savings Account (KIDS Account). Makes eligible to contribute to such account, and to receive a matching federal contribution, any U.S. citizen born after December 31, 2007, and under 18 years of age, whose modified adjusted gross income is below the applicable national median adjusted gross income amount.\n\nCreates the KIDS Account Fund Board to establish a default investment program under which, in a manner similar to a lifecycle investment program, sums in each KIDS Account are allocated to investment funds in the KIDS Account Fund based on the amount of time before the account holder attains the age of 18.\n\nStates that, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, each KIDS Account shall be treated in the same manner as a Roth IRA. Applies Roth IRA requirements separately to KIDS accounts.\n\nProvides for: (1) distributions for higher education expenses; and (2) privately managed KIDS accounts.\n\nSubjects the Board to the same composition requirements, duties, and responsibilities as the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board.\n\nInstructs the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, to develop programs to promote the financial literacy of account holders of KIDS Accounts."
