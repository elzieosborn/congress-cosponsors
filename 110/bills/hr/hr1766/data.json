Gives program allocation priority to interstate watersheds. Provides a cost-share payment exception for limited resource and beginning farmers.\n\nProvides: (1) cost-share and incentive payments for private forest owners to carry out specified conservation activities; and (2) state performance incentives.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into agreements with states containing all or a portion of a large waterbody or its tributaries for water quality initiatives. (States that the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries shall be one of such waterbodies.) Authorizes appropriations.\n\nDirects (currently, authorizes) the Secretary to pay the cost of conservation innovation grants. Makes such grants available for projects that include a technology transfer plan.\n\nExtends: (1) the conservation reserve program; (2) the conservation security program; and (3) the wetlands reserve program.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a conservation planning pilot program in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Authorizes appropriations.\n\nAmends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to: (1) extend the agricultural management assistance program; and (2) make Virginia eligible for such assistance.\n\nAmends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 with respect to the biorefinery and biofuel grant program to: (1) extend such program; and (2) provide grants for Chesapeake Bay Watershed states (Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia and the District of Columbia) to develop the commercial viability of no-till soybean biodiesel production, cellulosic ethanol production, manure to energy processes, and other technologies that promote the conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals and the reduction of nutrient impacts to water.\n\nExtends the renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements program. Obligates amounts for Chesapeake Bay Watershed states."
