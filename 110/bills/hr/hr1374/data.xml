  <summary date="2008-03-10T18:34:28Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends the Florida National Forest Land Management Act of 2003 to: (1) authorize the conveyance of an additional tract of federal land pursuant to the Act; and (2) provide for the disposition of the net proceeds derived from sales or exchanges under the Act to be available for expenditure by the Secretary of Agriculture for the acquisition, construction, or maintenance of administrative improvements for units of the National Forest System in Florida.

Permits: (1) proceeds from the sale or exchange of such additional tract to be used exclusively for the purchase of inholdings in the Apalachicola National Forest; and (2) proceeds from any sale or exchange of land under this Act to be used for administrative improvements, as authorized above, only if the land generating the proceeds was improved with infrastructure.</summary>
