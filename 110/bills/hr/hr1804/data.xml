  <summary date="2007-04-10T19:08:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Gulf States Medicare Rehabilitation Unit Access Act of 2007 - Provides for certification of certain rehabilitation units of general acute care hospitals affected by Hurricane Katrina for purposes of the prospective payment system under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act.

Authorizes a Katrina-affected hospital, if it seeks treatment as a rehabilitation unit of any such unit that is to be reopened, to provide a written certification that the inpatient population the hospital intends the unit to serve meets certain requirements, instead of showing that the unit has treated such a population during the hospital's most recent cost reporting period in the same manner as a hospital that seeks exclusion of a new rehabilitation unit may provide such a certification.</summary>
