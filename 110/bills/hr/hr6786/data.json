    "text": "Delaware Judgment Funds Distribution Settlement Act of 2008 - Directs the United States to offer to file with the Delaware Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma, a joint motion for entry of judgment of a specified sum in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as a final settlement of all trust claims of that Tribe that were or could have been brought regarding trust fund mismanagement.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Interior to carry out necessary actions to satisfy any remaining monetary obligations identified in the judgment for Delawares of Idaho, Inc., et al. v. Clark, and subsequent orders of that court. Requires: (1) the Secretary to pay to the Tribe's governing body for programming purposes each per capita payment of an eligible member of the Delaware Tribe identified as underpaid in an amount that is less than $5; and (2) any amounts remaining one year after 80% of the initial distributions have been made to be provided to the governing body for such purposes.\n\nFinds that a December 3, 1940 letter of the Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, approved by Assistant Secretary Chapman for the Department of the Interior on January 23, 1941, determined that the Tribe was eligible to organize as a separate tribe under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. Provides that if the Tribe elects to be, and is, reorganized by the Secretary under that Act, such restoration shall be subject to specified provisions regarding the resolution of issues between the Delaware Tribe and the Cherokee Nation."
