  <summary date="2007-10-11T14:14:18Z" status="Reported to Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 8, 2007. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Energy Technology Transfer Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to direct the Secretary of Energy to award grants for a five-year period to nonprofit institutions, state and local governments, cooperative extension services, or institutions of higher education to establish a geographically dispersed network of Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers, located in areas the Secretary determines have the greatest need of their services.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) give priority to applicants already operating or partnered with an outreach program capable of transferring such knowledge and information about advanced energy efficiency methods and technologies; (2) give preference to those that would significantly expand on or fill a gap in existing programs in a geographical region; and (3) consider the special needs and opportunities for increased energy efficiency for manufactured and site-built housing, including construction, renovation, and retrofit.

Sets forth Center activities and operations. Prescribes selection criteria.

Prohibits the use of grant funds for facilities construction.</summary>
