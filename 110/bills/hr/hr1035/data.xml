  <summary date="2007-02-24T17:13:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Living Organ Donor Tax Credit Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a nonrefundable tax credit for a donation of a qualified life-saving organ for transplantation by a living individual into another individual. Defines "qualified life-saving organ" as a kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, intestine, bone marrow, or any part thereof. Limits the annual amount of such credit to $5,000 of the unreimbursed costs and lost wages incurred by an organ donor in connection with an organ transplant.

Amends: (1) the Public Health Service Act to reduce federal living organ donation grants by any tax credit for organ donation received under this Act; and (2) the National Organ Transplant Act to provide that any such tax credit shall not be deemed valuable consideration for purposes of the ban against organ purchases.</summary>
