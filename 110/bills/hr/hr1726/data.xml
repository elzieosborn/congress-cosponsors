States that this Act shall not apply to a covered animal: (1) during lawful transport; (2) in lawful rodeo exhibitions, state or county fair exhibitions, or other similar exhibitions; (3) in lawful scientific or agricultural research; (4) undergoing veterinary care; or (5) in the case of a sow, during the seven day period prior to the date the sow is expected to give birth.

Defines "covered animal" as any non-aquatic farm animal, including a pig, head of bison or cattle, chicken, turkey, duck, goose, goat, sheep, rabbit, ostrich, emu, or rhea intended for food production use.</summary>
