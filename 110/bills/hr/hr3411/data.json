Requires the Administrator to award matching grants to public agencies to implement such plan.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to award grants for the establishment of four regional research, training, and technical assistance centers.\n\nRequires the Administrator to award grants to public agencies to reform their mental health and substance abuse policies with respect to juveniles who come into contact with the juvenile justice system.\n\nRequires states receiving juvenile justice grants to include in their state plan information regarding screening, assessment, and treatment of juveniles with mental health and substance abuse disorders.\n\nRequires the Administrator to: (1) distribute evidence-based practice bonuses to grant recipients if certain requirements are met; and (2) include in the Office's annual report to Congress information regarding the prevalence of mental health disorders among juveniles.\n\nRequires the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to examine and report on evidence-based practices for decreasing delinquency and recidivism among juveniles with mental health or substance abuse disorders.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure that a portion of grants awarded under programs to divert individuals with a mental illness from the criminal justice system specifically target juveniles if appropriations for such grants exceed a specified amount."
