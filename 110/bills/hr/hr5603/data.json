    "text": "National Guard Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act of 2008 - Adds the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (Chief) to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nRequires the Chief to: (1) identify gaps between federal and state military capabilities to prepare for and respond to emergencies; and (2) make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense for military assistance to civil authorities to address such gaps. Requires annual defense budget documents to specify separate amounts for training and equipment for the National Guard for military assistance to civil authorities and other domestic operations.\n\nRedesignates the: (1) Director and Deputy Director of the Army National Guard as the Vice Chief and Deputy Vice Chief of the Army National Guard; and (2) Director and Deputy Director of the Air National Guard as the Vice Chief and Deputy Vice Chief of the Air National Guard. Treats Vice Chief service as an adjutant general as joint duty experience for assignment or promotion purposes.\n\nStates that the United States Northern Command and the United States Pacific Command shall be the combatant commands principally responsible for the military support of civil authorities in the United States. Requires the Commander of each Command and the Chief to enter into a memorandum of understanding setting forth the operational relationships, and individual roles and responsibilities, during responses to domestic emergencies among such Commands and the National Guard Bureau.\n\nDirects the Secretary to assure that tactical control of the Armed Forces on duty within a state or possession is vested in the governor thereof when such forces are engaged in emergency response activities.\n\nRequires the officer serving as: (1) Commander of Army North Command to be an officer in the Army National Guard; and (2) Commander of Air Force North Command to be an officer in the Air National Guard. Expresses the sense of Congress that, in assigning officers to such positions, the President should afford a preference to officers who have served as a state adjutant general.\n\nRequires at least one of each of three specified commander and deputy commander joint task force positions to be an officer in the Army or Air National Guard."
