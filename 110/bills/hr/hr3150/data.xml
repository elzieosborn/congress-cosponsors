  <summary date="2007-08-31T19:33:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Anti-Gang Enforcement Act of 2007 - Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) prohibit certain criminal street gang crimes, including recruitment of persons into such gangs, participation in such gangs by committing two or more predicate gang crimes, and solicitation to commit a predicate gang crime; (2) impose or increase criminal penalties for committing certain violent crimes in aid of a criminal street gang or racketeering activity, for murder or other violent crimes while committing a drug trafficking crime, and for the use of interstate or foreign commerce facilities in the commission of two or more murders; and (3) provide for forfeiture of property obtained through criminal street gang activity. Defines "criminal street gang" and "predicate gang crime" for purposes of this Act.

Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend its sentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for crimes committed in furtherance or in aid of criminal street gangs.

Directs the Attorney General to: (1) expand the Project Safe Neighborhoods program to require U.S. attorneys to identify, investigate, and prosecute significant criminal street gangs operating within their districts and to coordinate anti-gang activities; and (2) require the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to increase funding for the Safe Streets Program and to support criminal street gang enforcement teams. Authorizes the Attorney General to hire 94 additional assistant U.S. attorneys for the Project Safe Neighborhoods program.</summary>
