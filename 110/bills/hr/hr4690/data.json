    "text": "Bluffton University Safety Act of 2007 - Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to prescribe federal motor vehicle safety standards for occupant protection systems for new and existing motorcoaches. Directs the Secretary to carry out, and submit to Congress, an independent study on the passenger safety benefits of three-point passenger safety restraints and compartmentalization in motorcoaches and whether the use of one methodology reduces or enhances passenger safety benefits of the other methodology.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that it is in the public interest for states to adopt and enforce mandatory seat belt use laws that require the use of seat belts.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a qualified motorcoach safety credit to a taxpayer for the costs of new and existing motorcoaches to comply with the federal motor vehicle safety standards.\n\nRequires the Secretary to provide grants (not to exceed $20,000) to motorcoach operators to assist with the cost of retrofitting motorcoaches in order to comply with such federal standards.\n\nAmends the Small Business Act to grant the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) the authority to make SBA loans and loan guarantees to motorcoach operators to retrofit their buses and motorcoaches for occupant protection."
