Directs the President, as soon as practicable, to institute a regional diplomatic plan, in conjunction with the United Nations (UN) Security Council, to attempt to: (1) curtail the ongoing civil war in Iraq; (2) contain such civil war to prevent its spread into neighboring countries; (3) prevent the establishment of al Qaeda safe havens; (4) prevent regional war; and (5) prevent genocide.

Requires a report from the President to Congress, within 30 days after the enactment of this Act and every 30 days thereafter, on the status and progress of the diplomatic plan.</summary>
