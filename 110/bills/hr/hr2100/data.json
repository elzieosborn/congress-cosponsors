Prohibits requiring or encouraging any federal contractor or subcontractor to so discriminate or grant a preference.\n\n Prohibits states and private entities that receive federal financial assistance from so discriminating or granting a preference in connection with any contract or subcontract, employment, or admission to any educational institution.\n\nProhibits construing this Act to prohibit or limit: (1) any act designed to benefit historically Black colleges or universities; or (2) any action under a federal law or treaty relating to the Indian tribes. Declares that this Act does not prohibit or limit employment classifications based on sex if sex is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to normal operation or the classification is applied regarding an armed forces member. Allows any aggrieved person to obtain, in a civil action, appropriate relief (including back pay) from the violator, including from a government entity. Requires awarding a prevailing plaintiff attorney's fees as part of the costs."
