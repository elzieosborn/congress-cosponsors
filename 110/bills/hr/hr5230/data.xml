Requires the district court, upon application by the House (or any authorized committee or subcommittee), to issue a mandatory compliance order to an entity or person refusing, or failing to comply with, or threatening to refuse or not to comply with, a subpoena or order. Authorizes the court to hold in contempt any refusal or failure to obey a lawful order.

Authorizes the General Counsel of the House of Representatives to bring a civil action under any statute conferring jurisdiction on any U.S. court to enforce, to secure a declaratory judgment concerning the validity of, or to prevent a threatened failure or refusal to comply with, any subpoena or order issued by the House (or a committee or a subcommittee).

Prescribes a procedure for consideration in the House of a resolution to direct the General Counsel to bring such an action.</summary>
