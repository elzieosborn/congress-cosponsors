  <summary date="2007-02-10T15:46:43Z" status="Introduced in House">Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage to provide comprehensive coverage for routine immunizations for each individual under 19 years of age who is a dependent of a participant or beneficiary under the plan. Requires coverage of routine immunizations without deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing in accordance with the most recent version of the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Applies such requirement to coverage offered in the individual market.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor to ensure that: (1) such requirement has the same effect at all times; and (2) such Secretaries have a coordinated enforcement strategy.</summary>
