  <summary date="2007-09-10T19:38:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Japan Currency Manipulation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on: (1) currency intervention by Japan with respect to the rate of exchange of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar and other currencies since 2000; and (2) any effort by Japan to create an exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies since March 2004.

Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a proposal for a comprehensive joint U.S.-European Union plan to address the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) initiate consultations with Japan to decrease Japan's foreign currency reserve holdings to permit effective balance of payments adjustments and to eliminate its unfair competitive advantage in international trade; and (2) take appropriate action to dissuade, prevent, or object to currency intervention by Japan.

Directs the United States to call for the convening of a special meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reach a multilateral agreement regarding: (1) the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies; (2) the destabilizing effects of the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen; and (3) Japan's excessive foreign currency reserve holdings.

Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on: (1) progress made toward decreasing Japan's foreign currency reserve holdings; and (2) actions taken at meetings of the G-7 Leaders, G-7 Finance Ministers, and the IMF regarding the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies, including any progress toward eliminating such misalignment.</summary>
