  <summary date="2008-06-04T20:43:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Vaccines for the Uninsured Adult Act of 2008 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program for the free distribution of adult vaccines through states to adults who do not have health insurance coverage, who receive such vaccines at federally-qualified health centers or federal, state, or local correctional institutions, and who are uninsured with respect to such vaccines; (2) require the Secretary to develop and maintain a plan to respond to vaccine shortages and to implement a plan to educate the public about adult immunization; and (3) allocate funds for state programs to provide free adult immunization and to require states receiving federal funding to develop plans to respond to vaccine shortages.

Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to prohibit co-payments and cost-sharing charges for adult vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish standards for the measurement of use by Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries of routinely recommended adult immunizations; and (2) study including adult immunization by Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as a performance measure under quality initiatives; (3) establish standards for the measurement of use by health care workers of adult immunizations for influenza; (4) study the best practices of health insurers and managed care organizations to encourage the use of adult immunizations; and (5) study the feasibility and advisability of including health care worker immunization rates as a performance measure for accreditation under Medicare.

Requires coverage of adult immunization services under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).</summary>
