  <summary date="2008-06-10T20:44:59Z" status="Introduced in House">Citizen and Community Preparedness Act of 2008 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish: (1) a Community Preparedness Division in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and (2) a Citizen Corps Program in the Division, through which the Secretary of Homeland Security shall bring community and government leaders together to coordinate efforts to strengthen community involvement in emergency preparedness, planning, mitigation, response, and recovery for acts of terrorism and natural disasters.

Gives the Director of that Division primary responsibility within DHS for assisting the efforts of state, local, and tribal governments in preparing citizens for emergencies. Requires the Director to consider the unique preparedness challenges faced by specified underserved populations, including persons with disabilities and limited English proficiency, socially and economically disadvantaged households, the elderly, children, and individuals with pets.

Directs the Secretary to make grants to states to: (1) form and sustain a state or local Citizen Corps Council; and (2) develop and implement educational programs for the public on terrorism and natural disaster preparedness and volunteer responsibilities. Conditions receipt of funds by states on outreach efforts to underserved populations, neighborhoods bordering critical infrastructure, and specified communities and community service organizations.

Establishes in the Division: (1) a Community Emergency Response Team Program; (2) a Fire Corps Program; and (3) a National Citizen Corps Council.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) carry out a public affairs campaign; and (2) commence a pilot program to enhance citizen preparedness at primary and secondary schools and on university and college campuses.</summary>
