  <summary date="2007-07-26T17:15:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Advantage Truth in Advertising Act of 2007 - Amends part C (Medicare+Choice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to restrict cost-sharing under the Medicare Advantage (MA) Program to a level no greater (and permissably less) than the cost-sharing that would otherwise be imposed under the original Medicare fee-for-service program option.

Declares that nothing regarding original Medicare fee-for-service program option benefits shall be construed as prohibiting an MA plan from using a flat copayment or per diem rate, under this Act, in lieu of the cost-sharing imposed under Medicare part A or part B.</summary>
