Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to monitor such admissions and suspend the entry of nationals from a country whose nationals have created an unacceptable number of program violations or pose security or law enforcement risks.\n\nProvides that a person: (1) seeking U.S. entry from the CNMI shall be processed under existing immigration authority regarding entry from Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and (2) denied admission shall be immediately removed.\n\nAuthorizes: (1) additional countries to be added to such visa waiver program; (2) creation of additional Guam or CNMI-only nonimmigrant visas; and (3) the Attorney General, the Secretary, and the Secretary of Labor to establish CNMI immigration operations offices.\n\nDirects the President and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to Congress respecting the transition program. Authorizes the Governor of CNMI to report to the President respecting the program.\n\nStates that the CNMI government shall: (1) not permit an increase in the number of alien workers in the CNMI as of the date of enactment of this Act; and (2) administer its non-refoulement protection program in accordance with its September 2003 agreement with the Department of the Interior.\n\nExempts hospitals in Guam, the CNMI, and the U.S. Virgin Islands from certain nurse admissions requirements.\n\n(Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations.\n\nTitle II: Northern Mariana Islands Delegate Act - Northern Mariana Islands Delegate Act - (Sec. 202) States that: (1) the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be represented in the U.S. Congress by the Resident Representative to the United States (authorized by the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union With the United States of America); and (2) the Resident Representative shall be a nonvoting Delegate to the House of Representatives and elected as provided for by this Act."
