    "text": "Hospital and ASC Price Disclosure and Litigation Protection Act of 2008 - Prohibits a charge-related legal action from being brought by an individual against a hospital or ambulatory surgical center if the hospital or center: (1) has met the requirements under this Act; (2) has entered into an agreement with the uninsured individual before treatment that sets the maximum price that will be charged for such treatment; and (3) has met the terms of such agreement.\n\nSets forth disclosures that a hospital or center must provide to an individual who is scheduled to receive treatment and include in any itemized bill, including: (1) the estimated price or the price charged for the treatment; (2) the payment rate for the treatment negotiated with the network plan or managed care plan that has the largest number of enrollees; and (3) the Medicare payment rate for the treatment. Excludes from such requirements a treatment for which there exists a third-party price arrangement unless the individual involved requests such information.\n\nRequires a hospital or ambulatory surgical center to report data to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding: (1) the frequency of performing certain services and administering certain drugs; (2) the charge by the hospital or center for such services or drugs; (3) the negotiated rate of payment for the treatment by the plan with the largest number of enrollees; and (4) the Medicare payment rate for the treatment.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) publicly post such information on the Internet in a manner that promotes charge comparisons among hospitals and centers; and (2) select which services or drugs are to be reported based on the frequency with which the services are performed or the drugs are administered."
