Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a mandatory employment verification program.

Revises related provisions respecting: (1) penalties; and (2) admissions and extensions of stay. Provides special provisions for alien sheepherders, goatherders, and dairy workers.

Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to H-2A employers for the transportation costs of workers whose employment is cut short by natural disaster; and (2) direct the Secretary to establish an H-2A Worker Program Ombudsman within the Office of the Chief Economist of the Department of Agriculture.

Amends the Immigrant Reform and Control Act of 1986 to limit the conditions under which the Legal Services Corporation may: (1) provide legal assistance for, or on behalf of, any alien; (2) bring a civil action for damages on behalf of an H-2A nonimmigrant (requires prior mediation); and (3) enter onto an employer's property.</summary>
