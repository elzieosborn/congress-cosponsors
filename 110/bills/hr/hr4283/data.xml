  <summary date="2008-01-04T15:05:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Literacy, Education, and Rehabilitation Act - Amends the federal criminal code to allow a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment of more than one year to receive credit beyond time already served for up to 60 days each year, in addition to any credit received for satisfactory behavior, for earning a certificate of completion in, or for participating in or teaching, a designated program that benefits prisoners or the Bureau of Prisons, including specified educational and vocational, treatment, and work and developmental programs.

Requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to establish the number of days of credit a prisoner may be awarded considering the difficulty, time required, responsibility expected, and rehabilitative benefits of the program.

 Makes any person sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the Attorney General's custody eligible for the credits, including prisoners transferred from foreign countries.

Directs the Bureau of Prisons to assure that a prisoner serves a reasonable part of the last portion (currently, the last ten percent) of the term of imprisonment under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to prepare for reentry into the community.</summary>
