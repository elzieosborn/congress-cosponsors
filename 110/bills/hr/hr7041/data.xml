  <summary date="2009-04-27T15:30:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to award grants to regional biocontainment laboratories for maintaining surge capacity that can be used to respond to acts of bioterrorism or outbreaks of infectious diseases. Authorizes the Secretary to award such a grant only if the laboratory agrees to allow the Secretary and other relevant federal agencies to inspect laboratory facilities.

Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on: (1) activities undertaken to integrate the network of regional biocontainment laboratories with the laboratory response network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and (2) the extent to which additional Biosafety Level 3 laboratories are needed to fulfill the national's laboratory surge capacity needs.</summary>
