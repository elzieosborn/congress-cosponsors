Gives the interim standard the legal effect of an occupational safety and health standard until the final standard becomes effective.\n\nRequires such standards to provide no less protection than the recommendations contained in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Alert \"Preventing Lung Disease in Workers Who Use or Make Flavorings\" and to include specified requirements for: (1) engineering, work practice controls, and respiratory protection to minimize exposure to diacetyl; (2) a written exposure control plan that will indicate specific measures the employer will take to minimize employee exposure; (3) airborne exposure assessments; (4) medical surveillance for workers and referral for prompt medical evaluations; (5) protective equipment and clothing for workers; and (6) the provision of written safety and health information and training to employees.\n\nRequires NIOSH to study and report to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on food flavorings that may be used as substitutes for diacetyl."
