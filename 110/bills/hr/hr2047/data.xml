  <summary date="2007-06-14T14:50:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Insurance for Life Act of 2007 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Internal Revenue Code, and the Public Health Service Act to remove all limitations on Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation coverage that establish a period by which such coverage must end, and instead provides no deadline for discontinuing such coverage. Sets forth a formula to determine the maximum allowable premium that certain qualified disabled beneficiaries and individuals receiving extended coverage provided pursuant to this Act may be charged based on the average monthly actuarial cost of such continuation coverage.

Applies such provisions to continuation coverage provided pursuant to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).</summary>
