Amends the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 to authorize civil actions in federal court for discrimination based on disability.

Settlement Encouragement and Fairness Act - Modifies the definition of "prevailing party" for purposes of provisions governing the recovery of attorney's fees to include a party whose pursuit of a non-frivolous claim or defense was a catalyst for a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the opposing party that provides any significant part of the relief sought.

Preservation of Civil Rights Protections Act of 2008 - Makes arbitration clauses in employment contracts unenforceable, with exceptions.

Authorizes recovery of expert fees by prevailing parties in civil rights actions.
