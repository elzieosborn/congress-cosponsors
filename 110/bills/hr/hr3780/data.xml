  <summary date="2007-12-05T22:57:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Military Child College Affordability Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit a state from charging members of the armed forces who are on active duty for more than 30 days and whose domicile or permanent duty station is in such state, and such members' dependents, more than the in-state tuition for attending a public institution of higher education (IHE) in that state.

Provides that, even if such members' permanent duty station is subsequently changed to a location outside the state, they or their dependents must continue to be charged no more than the in-state tuition if they remain continuously enrolled at such IHE in the state.</summary>
