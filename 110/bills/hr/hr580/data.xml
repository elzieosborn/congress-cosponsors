  <summary date="2007-03-28T17:25:31Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 20, 2007. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends the federal judicial code to provide for a person appointed as U.S. attorney to serve until the earlier of: (1) the qualification of a U.S. attorney for such district appointed by the President (as under current law); or (2) the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General.

Authorizes the U.S. district court for the particular district, if such a 120-day temporary appointment expires, to appoint a U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.

States that this Act is the exclusive means for appointing a person to perform temporarily the functions of a U.S. attorney for a district in which the office of a U.S. attorney is vacant.</summary>
