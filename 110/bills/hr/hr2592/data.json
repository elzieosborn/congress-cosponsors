Prohibits such an entity from accepting any funding for the technical programs of a Critical Path Public-Private Partnership from any individual or organization that manufactures, distributes, or sells any FDA-regulated product. Establishes an exception for accepting funds from a consortium of companies whose products are FDA-regulated if the Secretary determines that such acceptance would not result in any conflict of interest and issues a waiver."
