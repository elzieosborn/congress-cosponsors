  <summary date="2009-02-03T22:29:07Z" status="Introduced in House">National Security Professionals Act of 2008 - Directs the President to establish a National Security Career Development Program to provide national security professionals access to integrated education, training, and professional experience interagency opportunities.

Requires: (1) the Program to establish policies to identify a threshold of interagency experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities required to obtain a national security interagency certification; and (2) the certification to be a consideration for promotion.

Requires the President's budget request to include funding requirements to establish and maintain the Program.

Requires the Program to include: (1) a rigorous and effective set of educational opportunities for national security professionals; (2) training that refreshes or enhances such a professional's expertise in planning, coordinating, and executing national security missions through instruction, drills, and exercises that take into account the full spectrum of threats and hazards that comprise America's 21st century risk environment; and (3) opportunities for professional interagency experience and intergovernmental, interagency, and interoffice assignments, fellowships, and exchanges.

Requires the program to: (1) link career advancement or other incentives to participation in rotational or temporary detail interagency assignments; and (2) establish appropriate career development programs for political appointees in national security positions.</summary>
