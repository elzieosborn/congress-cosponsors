The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nLevee-Like Structure Consideration Act of 2007 - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to issue and make effective notice or guidance providing, for purposes of determining flood plain areas and flood-risk zones under the national flood insurance program: (1) a specified process by which a community may request and obtain from the Administrator a determination, including provisional accreditation, of the nature and extent of any flood protection afforded by any structure or feature that was recognized as having some mitigating effect on flood risk on the applicable flood insurance rate map in effect on January 1, 2003, but that does not meet federal requirements for recognition as a levee offering protection from the base flood for purposes of such program; and (2) that any flood protections so determined to be afforded by such structure or feature shall be recognized on and incorporated in updated flood insurance rate maps for any area whose flood risk is affected."
