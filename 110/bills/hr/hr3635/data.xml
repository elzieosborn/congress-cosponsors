  <summary date="2008-01-31T22:40:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Everson Walls and Ron Springs Gift for Life Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to establish a National Organ Tissue Donor Registry Resource Center, which shall: (1) advance the development, expansion, and evaluation of state organ and tissue donor registries; (2) facilitate timely access to, and the exchange of accurate donor information between, such registries 24 hours a day; (3) ensure that funded registries comply with requirements; (4) provide technical assistance to states for such registries; and (5) maintain a registry information clearinghouse.

Requires the Secretary to award grants or cooperative agreements to eligible entities for such registries. Requires recipients to agree to establish benchmarks for improvement in organ and tissue donation and to maintain registries that: (1) allow a donor to include a statement or symbol that the donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; (2) allow organ procurement organizations to access that information, at or near the donor's death, 24 hours a day; and (3) bar the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information for any other purpose without the donor's consent.

Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a living donor database to track short- and long-term health effects for donors associated with living organ donation.</summary>
