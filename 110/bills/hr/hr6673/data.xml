  <summary date="2008-11-07T15:20:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends competitive lease provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to set forth conditions under which areas that adjoin federal or nonfederal land for which a qualified company or individual holds a legal right to develop geothermal resources may be made available to the company or individual for noncompetitive lease at the fair market value per acre.

Includes as such conditions that sufficient data has been submitted by a qualified geothermal professional to the relevant federal land management agency to engender a belief that: (1) there is a valid discovery of geothermal or geothermal steam resources on the lands for which the company or individual holds the right to develop the resources; and (2) the thermal feature extends into the adjoining areas.</summary>
