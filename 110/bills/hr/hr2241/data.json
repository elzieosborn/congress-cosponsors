    "text": "Diabetes Treatment and Prevention Act of 2007 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish the Division of Diabetes Translation to eliminate diabetes.\n\nRequires the Director to develop pilot demonstration projects to evaluate various approaches to: (1) screening and identifying persons with pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes; and (2) providing such persons with access to appropriate lifestyle interventions. Requires such projects to be carried out with the goal of translating the Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial into interventions to reduce the incidence of type-2 diabetes and its related complications in the U.S. population.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director, to engage in partnerships with state and local health departments to carry out: (1) national, state, and local surveillance related to diabetes; and (2) education and information campaigns to increase awareness about the importance of primary prevention, ways to assess personal risk, and how to locate and access diabetes prevention programs.\n\nRequires the Director, acting through the Division, to develop a pilot program to improve treatment for individuals with diabetes and other co-occurring chronic conditions for which treatment may complicate the treatment for diabetes. Requires the Director to give preference to research that: (1) focuses on conditions which have a high prevalence among individuals with diabetes or for which the treatment involved has the potential to impact adherence to diabetes treatment regiments; and (2) builds upon existing work designed to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes."
