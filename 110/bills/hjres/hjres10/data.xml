  <summary date="2007-01-22T19:41:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Constitutional Amendment - Requires Congress and the President, before each fiscal year, to agree on an estimate of total receipts for that fiscal year by enactment into law of a joint resolution devoted solely to that subject. Prohibits outlays for such fiscal year (except those for repayment of debt principal) from exceeding such estimated receipts for that fiscal year (except those derived from borrowing) unless Congress, by a three-fifths rollcall vote of each chamber, authorizes a specific excess of outlays over estimated receipts.

Provides that whenever actual outlays exceed actual receipts for any fiscal year, Congress shall, in the ensuing fiscal year, provide by law for the repayment of such excess. Requires a three-fifths rollcall vote of each chamber to increase the public debt limit. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress annually. Prohibits any bill to increase revenue from becoming law unless approved by a majority of each chamber by rollcall vote. Authorizes waivers of these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect.</summary>
