  <summary date="2007-01-11T19:28:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes the special legal and political relationship the Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn covenant with the land we share.

Commends and honors the Native Peoples for the thousands of years that they have stewarded and protected this land.

Acknowledges years of official depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes.

Apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on them by U.S. citizens.

Expresses the regret of the United States for the ramifications of former offenses and its commitment to build on the positive relationships of the past and present to move toward reconciliation.

Urges the President to acknowledge the offenses of the United States against Indian tribes in U.S. history.

Commends the State governments that have begun reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located in their boundaries, and encourages all State governments to do the same.

Declares that nothing in this Joint Resolution authorizes any claim against the United States or serves as a settlement of any claim against it.</summary>
