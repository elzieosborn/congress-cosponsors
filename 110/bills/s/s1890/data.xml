  <summary date="2007-12-21T21:48:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Flood Insurance Choice Act of 2007 - Amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to permit an individual homeowner not to purchase property flood insurance, even for property in a special flood hazard area, if he or she submits certain written certifications to the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the state, community, or local official responsible for zoning and building codes.



Declares that such homeowner shall not be required to comply with certain base flood elevation requirements.

Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, with respect to land use controls, financial assistance and mitigation assistance, to shield from penalties for non-compliance those areas that have complied with its requirements but where individuals have opted out pursuant to this Act.

Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to deny assistance for individuals who have opted-out of the flood insurance program.</summary>
