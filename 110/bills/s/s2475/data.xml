  <summary date="2008-06-06T19:05:09Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 with respect to fiscal year distributions by the Secretary of the Interior from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for states having an approved abandoned mine reclamation program (in particular, the active mining threshold required of states to meet the minimum funding threshold).

Exempts minimum program states from specified mandatory reductions in such distributions (because they fail to meet the active mining threshold requirement).</summary>
