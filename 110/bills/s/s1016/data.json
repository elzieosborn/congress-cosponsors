    "text": "Solar Opportunity and Local Access Rights Act - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require each state regulatory authority with ratemaking authority, and each nonregulated electric utility, to conduct a hearing, and on the basis of such hearing, adopt a net metering standard.\n\nRequires retail electric suppliers to offer to arrange to make net metering available to retail customers on a first-come-first-served basis.\n\nPrescribes implementation requirements regarding: (1) net energy measurement; (2) billing practices; (3) ownership of credits; (4) safety and performance standards; and (5) determination of compliance.\n\nDirects the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to publish model interconnection standards, according to specified requirements, for the physical connection between local distribution systems and qualified generation units and qualified electric generation units that do not exceed 20,000 kilowatts of capacity. Requires states to adopt such model standards, subject to FERC approval.\n\n\n\n\n\nProhibits a state or nonregulated utility from adopting or enforcing any standard or requirement concerning net metering or interconnection that restricts access to the electric power transmission or local distribution system by qualified generators beyond those established under this Act.\n\nAllows states to adopt or enforce additional incentives or requirements to encourage qualified generation and net metering, including any that afford: (1) greater access to the electric power transmission and local distribution systems by qualified generators; or (2) greater compensation or credit for electricity generated by qualified generators.\n\nAmends federal law governing administrative services for public buildings and properties to authorize a contract for renewable energy for a maximum period of 30 years.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to issue regulations to prohibit: (1) excessive fees for solar energy systems building permits; and (2) any restriction impairing the ability of the owner or lessee of a one-family residential structure to install or use a solar energy system on such property.\n\nDirects the Secretary to issue regulations also requiring that the application for approval of such a system: (1) be processed and approved in the same manner as an application for approval of an architectural modification to the property; and (2) not be willfully avoided or delayed."
