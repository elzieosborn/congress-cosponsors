Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a plan for the assignment and distribution of protective security advisors that takes into account baseline requirements and anticipated growth to: (1) ensure that protective security advisors are located across the United States and provide appropriate coverage and coordinated support, especially in high-risk regions; and (2) assign protective security advisors and support staff based on risk.</summary>
