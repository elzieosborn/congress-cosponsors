Requires: (1) an eligible entity that receives a grant to develop an autism navigator program that will recruit, employ, train, assign, and supervise autism navigators; and (2) the HHS Secretary to provide for evaluations to determine the effects of navigator services.

Directs the HHS Secretary, in coordination with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to: (1) develop, demonstrate, and disseminate a standard curriculum for training first responders in assisting individuals with autism and other cognitive behavioral disabilities and their families during emergencies; and (2) award grants to states and local governments to train first responders in providing assistance to such individuals in emergency situations.

Requires the HUD Secretary to convene a task force to establish a housing demonstration grant program to award grants to entities to provide a program aimed at providing individualized housing and services to adults with an autism spectrum disorder.</summary>
