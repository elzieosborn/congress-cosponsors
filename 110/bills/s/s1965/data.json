Renders the Federal Advisory Committee Act inapplicable to the working group.\n\n(Sec. 105) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require elementary and secondary schools with computer access to the Internet to educate minors about appropriate online behavior, including online interaction with other individuals in social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying awareness and response.\n\nTitle II: Enhancing Child Pornography Enforcement - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to impose a forfeiture penalty on Internet service providers who violate requirements of the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to report online child pornography."
