  <summary date="2008-06-09T20:43:44Z" status="Passed Senate amended">Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act - Title I: Promoting a Safe Internet for Children - (Sec. 101) Declares that the issue of Internet safety includes issues regarding the use of the Internet in a manner that promotes safe online activity for children, protects children from cybercrimes, including crimes by online predators, and helps parents shield their children from material that is inappropriate for minors.

(Sec. 102) Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to carry out a nationwide program to increase public awareness and provide education on strategies to promote the safe use of the Internet by children.

(Sec. 103) Requires the FTC to submit annual reports (by March 31) to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the activities of its public awareness campaign.

(Sec. 104) Directs the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to establish an Online Safety and Technology working group to review and evaluate: (1) the status of industry efforts to promote online safety for children; (2) the recordkeeping practices of electronic communications and remote computing service providers in connection with crimes against children; and (3) the development of technologies to help parents protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet.

Requires the working group to report to the Assistant Secretary and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on its findings. Renders the Federal Advisory Committee Act inapplicable to the working group.

(Sec. 105) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require elementary and secondary schools with computer access to the Internet to educate minors about appropriate online behavior, including online interaction with other individuals in social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying awareness and response.
