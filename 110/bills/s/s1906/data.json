Reserves a portion of appropriated funds for Indian tribes and tribal organizations.\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand and intensify the clinical research, health services research, and public health research on associations between substance use disorders, oral health, and the provision of dental care.\n\nRequires the Secretary to study the effect methamphetamine use has on the demand for, and provision of, dental care.\n\nDirects the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to support training and offer technical assistance to ensure that dentists and allied dental personnel are prepared to: (1) recognize signs of alcohol or drug addiction; (2) discuss the nature of substance abuse as it relates to their area of expertise; (3) understand how certain dental therapies can affect the relapse potential of substance dependent patients; and (4) help those affected by a substance use disorder find appropriate treatment for their conditions.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to collaborate with professional accrediting bodies to develop and support substance abuse training courses for oral health professionals."
