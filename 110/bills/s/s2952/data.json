    "text": "Safe School Lunch Act of 2008 - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to order an immediate halt to the distribution of meat, meat food products, poultry, or poultry products upon finding that they may cause a serious, adverse health consequence or be adulterated.\n\nGives persons subject to such an order the opportunity for an informal hearing, within 10 days after the order's issuance, on the actions required by the order and on whether it should be amended to require a recall of the targeted items. Requires the Secretary to order the recall of such items upon affirming that the order should include a recall.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) establish a program providing schools that participate in the school lunch or breakfast programs with training regarding the recall of meat, meat food products, poultry, and poultry products; (2) ensure that information on the Department of Agriculture's website concerning the inspection and recall of such items is current, clear, and accessible by school employees and parents; (3) promulgate regulations ensuring that all of such items inspected by the Secretary can be traced from slaughter to final distribution to schools participating in the school lunch or breakfast programs; and (4) review and evaluate the Department's inspection and recall procedures for such items."
