Terminates royalty suspension in the Planning Areas offshore Alaska.\n\nEstablishes a National Energy Security Research and Investment Reserve to fund energy research, including research relating to ethanol and biodiesel, and to defray the cost of providing fueling pumps to deliver new fuels to consumers.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and carry out a Low-Income Transportation Energy Assistance Program and establish a Fund to assist low-income households in purchasing gasoline or diesel fuel or bus passes, train tickets, or other mass-transit fares for transportation purposes. Provides for the transfer of windfall profits tax receipts to the Fund."
