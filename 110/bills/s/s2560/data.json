Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.\n\nAmends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) to revise the requirement that the state provide adult-supervised living arrangements for teenage parents not yet living in such an arrangement.\n\nSuspends the five-year time limit on TANF assistance for parents under age 21 who are involved in education or training.\n\nProhibits the imposition of sanctions under TANF with respect to minor parents unless the state has established procedures that help TANF recipients understand, avoid, or end sanctions, and has applied the procedures to the recipient.\n\nRequires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) TANF recipients who are parents and have not attained age 20; and (2) a representative sample of low-income teen parents who are not TANF recipients.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to include homeless youth as a qualified targeted population for the work opportunity business income tax credit."
