Requires the Secretary to give priority to entities that serve a population in a medically underserved area.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) support federal programs involved in improving the emergency care system to expand and accelerate research in emergency medical care systems and emergency medicine; and (2) support research to determine the estimated economic impact of, and savings that result from, the implementation of coordinated emergency care systems.</summary>
