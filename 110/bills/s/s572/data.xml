  <summary date="2007-03-06T16:25:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Student Aid Reward Act of 2007 - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to carry out a Student Aid Reward (SAR) Program of payments to encourage institutions of higher education (IHEs) to participate in the student loan program under title IV that is most cost-effective for taxpayers.

Requires that a SAR payment to an IHE equal at least 50% of the savings to the federal government generated by the IHE's participation in the most cost-effective student loan program, rather than one not cost-effective for taxpayers.

Requires IHEs receiving SAR payments to: (1) provide student loans under that most cost-effective program for five years after the payment date; and (2) use payment funds, where appropriate, to supplement student Pell Grants. Allows such funds to be used also to award need-based grants to lower and middle income graduate students.</summary>
