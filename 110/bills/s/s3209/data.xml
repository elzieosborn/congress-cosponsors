  <summary date="2008-09-30T18:59:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Title VII Fairness Act - Amends the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and title VII (Equal Employment Opportunities) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to delay the start of the time period for filing charges of employment discrimination until the aggrieved person has, or should be expected to have, enough information to support a reasonable suspicion of the discrimination, provided the aggrieved person demonstrates that the person did not have, and should not have been expected to have, enough information to support a reasonable suspicion of such discrimination on the date on which the alleged discrimination occurred. Prohibits applying these amendments to alleged discrimination relating to pensions or pension benefits.

Applies the above Civil Rights Act of 1964 amendment to discrimination claims brought under: (1) specified provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and (2) provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relating to employment by the federal government.</summary>
