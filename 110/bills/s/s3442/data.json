    "text": "Amends the National Oilheat Research Alliance Act of 2000 to adjust its focus upon oilheat to a focus upon oilheat fuel.\n\nDefines \"oilheat fuel\" as distillate liquid used as a fuel for nonindustrial commercial or residential space or hot water heating.\n\nMakes technical and conforming amendments.\n\nRevises the membership of the National Oilheat Research Alliance. Provides that, other than the public members of the Alliance, members shall be full-time managerial owners or employees of members of the oilheat fuel industry.\n\nRevises assessment requirements. States that the assessment rate for calendar years 2008 and 2009 shall be equal to two-tenths of 1% per gallon of distillate liquid (currently, No. 1 distillate and No. 2 dyed distillate).\n\nDeclares that, beginning with calendar year 2010, the annual assessment rate shall be sufficient to cover the costs of the plans and programs developed by the Alliance.\n\nSets forth: (1) a maximum assessment rate; and (2) limitations on any assessment increase.\n\nProhibits any consumer education activity undertaken with funds derived from Alliance assessments from including a direct reference to a competing product.\n\nRepeals the termination date for the Act (thus making it permanent)."
