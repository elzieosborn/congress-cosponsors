    "text": "FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2007 - Amends the National Housing Act with respect to Federal Housing Administration (FHA) housing loan insurance for manufactured homes (or lots for such homes).\n\nExempts such loans from certain financial institution portfolio limits, increasing an allowable claim for loss from 10% to 90% of an institution's total amount of such loans, credit advances, and purchases.\n\nMakes any new contract of insurance for such loans, credit advances, or purchases conclusive evidence of an institution's insurance eligibility. (Thus requires each loan to be insured individually instead of as part of a bundle of such loans.)\n\nIncreases loan limits, requiring annual indexing.\n\nSets forth borrower premium charges, including an up-front premium of up to 2.25% and an annual premium of up to 1%.\n\nRevises requirements for the handling and disposal of any real or personal conveyed to or acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the pursuit of all claims against mortgagors assigned to the Secretary by mortgagees.\n\nDirects the Secretary of HUD to establish underwriting criteria that will ensure the manufactured housing program's financial soundness."
