    "text": "Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to replace the hope and lifetime learning tax credits with a higher education opportunity tax credit.\n\nAllows a higher education opportunity tax credit for 100% of qualified tuition and related expenses (including a certain allowance for books) up to $1,000, 50% for such expenses between $1,000 and $3,000, and 20% of such expenses between $3,000 and $5,500. Reduces credit amounts for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes over $70,000 ($140,000 in the case of a joint return). Allows an increased tax credit for students who served certain periods of active duty in the Armed Forces after September 11, 2001.\n\nLimits such credit to three eligible students per taxpayer in any taxable year and for four taxable years.\n\n Denies such credit to certain part-time students and students convicted of a felony drug offense.\n\nRepeals the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses."
