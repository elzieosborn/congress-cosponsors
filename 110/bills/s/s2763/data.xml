Reduces credit amounts for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes over $70,000 ($140,000 in the case of a joint return). Allows an increased tax credit for students who served certain periods of active duty in the Armed Forces after September 11, 2001.

Limits such credit to three eligible students per taxpayer in any taxable year and for four taxable years.
