Makes specified provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act and other federal law inapplicable to that issuance.\n\nApplies the standard to ATVs manufactured or imported after the standard is published. Allows ATVs that comply with the standard to incorporate characteristics or components not covered by the standard.\n\nRequires each ATV manufacturer or importer to submit an action plan to the CPSC for approval and to comply with an approved plan.\n\nProhibits the importation or distribution of three-wheeled ATVs until a mandatory consumer product safety standard applicable to such vehicles is in effect.\n\nRequires each ATV to which the standard applies to bear a label certifying compliance."
