Requires the FCC to complete a specified Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the 700MHz Band and issue rules allowing certain channels within the current 24 MHz band of public safety spectrum to accommodate data communications.\n\nRequires the FCC to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the allocation for auction of the 30MHz band of recovered analog spectrum and establish specifications for a national public safety broadband network. Establishes the Public Safety Broadband Trust Corporation and requires, if no bidder is successful, granting it a license for the use of such spectrum. Specifies Corporation duties, including facilitating development of such network. Authorizes the FCC to enter into an agreement with the Corporation to guarantee loans to the Corporation. Pledges the full faith and credit of the United States for principal and interest."
