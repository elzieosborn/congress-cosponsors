Requires the appointment of a special prosecutor for enforcement of this Act.\n\nProhibits a federal government attorney, in determining whether to prosecute or take other action against an individual in a criminal matter, from considering: (1) the race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities or beliefs of such individual; (2) the personal feelings of such attorney concerning such individual, the associates of such individual, or the victim; or (3) the possible effect of a decision on the professional or personal circumstances of such attorney."
