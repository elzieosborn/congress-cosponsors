    "text": "Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007 - Amends the National Housing Act to: (1) modify guidelines governing the maximum principal loan obligation; (2) extend the mortgage term; and (3) revise requirements for cash payment by the mortgagor in the eligibility criteria for mortgage insurance.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to reinstate the current downpayment requirement in the event of increased defaults.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to establish a mortgage insurance premium structure involving a single premium payment collected prior to the insurance of the mortgage that may vary during the mortgage term as long as the basis for determining the variable rate is established before the execution of the mortgage. Sets forth maximum upfront premium amounts.\n\nPermits the Secretary to insure any mortgage covering a one-family unit in a condominium project if the project has a certain HUD-insured blanket mortgage.\n\nRevises requirements for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. Limits the authority of the Secretary to enter into commitments for loan guarantees.\n\nMakes insurance of a Native Hawaiian or Indian reservation mortgage the obligation of the MMI Fund (instead of the General Insurance Fund).\n\nEliminates the limitation placed upon the aggregate number of home equity conversion mortgages insured under the Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to insure a home equity conversion mortgage when its primary purpose is to enable an elderly mortgagor to purchase a one- to four-family dwelling in which the mortgagor will occupy one of the units.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements to insure temporarily certain mortgages for a single family residence located within a presidentially declared major disaster area.\n\nRedefines mortgagee to allow participation in the federal mortgage insurance program by state-licensed mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders who make, underwrite, or service mortgage loans."
