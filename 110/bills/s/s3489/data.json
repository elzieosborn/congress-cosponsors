The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with representatives of industry and environmental groups to conduct a study of black carbon emissions, which shall include: (1) an identification of the major sources of black carbon emissions in the United States and throughout the world, an estimate of the quantity of current and future emissions, and the net climate effects of the emissions from those sources; (2) an identification of the most effective and cost-effective control technologies, operations, or strategies for additional domestic and international reductions in black carbon reductions and the health benefits associated with additional reductions; and (3) recommendations regarding areas of focus for additional research for technologies, operations, and strategies with the highest potential to reduce black carbon emissions, government actions to encourage or require additional black carbon emission reductions, and the development of a climate-beneficial tropospheric ozone reduction strategy. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on the study results within 180 days after enactment of this Act."
