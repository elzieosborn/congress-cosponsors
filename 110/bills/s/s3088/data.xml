  <summary date="2008-12-31T21:10:22Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Oregon Badlands Wilderness Act of 2008 - (Sec. 3) Designates certain Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land in Oregon as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, which shall be known as the Oregon Badlands Wilderness.

Requires any land or interest in land within the boundary of the Oregon Badlands Wilderness that is acquired by the United States to become part of the Wilderness.

Permits established livestock grazing in the Wilderness to continue.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide to any owner of private property within the boundary of the Oregon Badlands Wilderness adequate access to such property.

Designates a certain corridor of BLM-managed land with a width of 25 feet as potential wilderness. Permits authorized and existing nonconforming uses to continue in the potential wilderness. Designates the potential wilderness as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System and incorporated into the Oregon Badlands Wilderness on the date on which the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register notice that such nonconforming uses have terminated.

(Sec. 4) Releases specified portions of the Badlands wilderness study area that are not designated as the Oregon Badlands Wilderness or as potential wilderness by this Act from further study for designation for preservation as wilderness.

(Sec. 5) Provides for the following land exchanges: (1) the Clarno land exchange; and (2) the Central Oregon Irrigation District land exchange.

Sets forth requirements for the valuation, appraisal, and equalization of the federal and non-federal lands to be exchanged under this section.

Requires any cash equalization payments received by the Secretary to be deposited in the Federal Land Disposal Account established by the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act and used in accordance with such Act.

Provides for the federal government and the owner of the non-federal land in a land exchange described above to equally share all costs related to the exchange, including the costs of appraisals, surveys, and any necessary environmental clearances.

Subjects the exchange of federal and non-federal lands under this section to any easements, rights-of-way, and other valid existing rights.

Expresses the intent of Congress that such land exchanges be completed within two years after the enactment of this Act.

(Sec. 6) Specifies this Act's effect with respect to the protection of the treaty rights of any Indian tribe, including the off-reservation reserved rights secured by the Treaty with the Tribes and Bands of Middle Oregon of June 25, 1855.</summary>
