  <summary date="2007-12-17T15:10:17Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Glaucoma Screening Act of 2007 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to expand coverage of screening for glaucoma to include individuals who are both older than 49 years of age and Hispanic.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to award a grant to an eligible entity to provide glaucoma screenings to individuals determined to be at high risk. Requires such an entity to: (1) utilize mobile screening units to test for glaucoma and other eye diseases; (2) target screening activities to populations primarily consisting of high-risk individuals; (3) form partnerships with federally-qualified health centers to increase awareness of the need for glaucoma screenings and to provide screenings for high-risk individuals; and (4) provide grants to approved medical residency training programs to permit participating students to conduct such screenings.</summary>
