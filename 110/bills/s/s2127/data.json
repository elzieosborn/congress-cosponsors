    "text": "Mine Disaster Family Assistance Act of 2007 - Amends the MINER Act to require the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, as soon as practicable after being notified of a mining accident involving a mine operator and resulting in a mine emergency response by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), to: (1) designate and publicize the name and phone number of a director of a family support service as a point of contact within the federal government for the families of miners involved and as a liaison between the operator and the families; and (2) designate an independent nonprofit organization with primary responsibility for coordinating the emotional care and support of the miners' families.\n\nSets forth responsibilities of the MSHA and the designated organization in such an accident.\n\nProhibits: (1) impeding the ability of MSHA or the designated organization to carry out their responsibilities or the ability of families to have contact with one another; (2) unsolicited communications by attorneys or parties to litigation to injured individuals or their families concerning a potential action for personal injury or wrongful death before the 45th day following the accident date; and (3) preventing a designated organization from providing mental health and counseling services.\n\nDirects operators that are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to submit to the Secretary of Labor a plan for addressing the needs of the families of miners involved in such accidents. Shields an operator from liability for damages (except for gross negligence or intentional misconduct) in any action brought in a federal or state court arising out of the operator's performance in preparing or providing a miner list pursuant to such plan.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish a task force to develop guidelines and recommendations about responding to mining accidents."
