    "text": "Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act of 2008 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to states to enable them to award competitive subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) or partnerships between LEAs and other public or nonprofit entities to plan and implement expanded learning time initiatives at high-need schools that they serve.\n\nRequires such initiatives to: (1) increase the total number of school hours each year at participant schools by at least 30%, compared to the school hours per year that are standard for comparable schools in their school district; and (2) expand learning time for all students in all grade levels in such schools, except in high schools where expanded learning time must apply to at least one entire grade level.\n\nDirects states to give subgrant priority to LEAs that serve a high percentage of students from low-income families and partnerships that include a community-based organization, institution of higher education, community learning center, or entity carrying out an after-school program.\n\nPermits the Secretary to: (1) award planning and implementation grants directly to a partnership that serves more than one area in more than one state; and (2) provide technical assistance to grantees and subgrantees in developing and implementing expanded learning time initiatives.\n\nRequires: (1) grantees to establish measures for assessing the success of their expanded learning time initiatives; and (2) the Secretary to contract with an independent organization with expertise in school improvement, program evaluation, and measurement to evaluate this Act's program and provide technical assistance to grantees and subgrantees in collecting data and evaluating their programs."
