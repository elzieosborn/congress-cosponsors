  <summary date="2008-06-02T18:55:02Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit funds from being dispersed to a country that denies or unreasonably delays the acceptance of its citizens, nationals, or residents who have been ordered removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) from the United States.

Amends INA to prohibit visa issuance to citizens, nationals, or residents of such country unless: (1) the country is in full compliance with travel document requirements under this Act; or (2) Congress waives such prohibition.

Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to Congress every three months listing countries that deny or delay such repatriation. Imposes assistance and visa prohibitions on a listed country that does not issue appropriate travel documents for such aliens.

Authorizes presidential waiver of such assistance and visa prohibitions.</summary>
