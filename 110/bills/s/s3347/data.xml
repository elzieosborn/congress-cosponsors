  <summary date="2008-08-05T21:07:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Put School Counselors Where They're Needed Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to implement a demonstration project providing competitive, four-year grants to at least 10 secondary schools that have a four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate of 60% or lower, for the provision of additional school counselors and counselor resources.

Expresses the sense of Congress that grantees should provide one additional counselor for every 250 students at risk.

Requires the additional school counselors to serve primarily students identified as being at risk of not graduating in four years.

Makes grantees that demonstrate progress in improving their graduation rates eligible for subsequent grants.</summary>
