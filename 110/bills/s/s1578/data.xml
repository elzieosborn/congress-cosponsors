  <summary date="2008-05-13T18:52:23Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ballast Water Management Act of 2007 - Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to replace provisions relating to preventing the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes through the exchange of ballast water with provisions relating to the introduction and spread of such species from ballast water and other ship-borne vectors. (Currently, the provisions focus only on the Great Lakes.)

 Requires vessel operators to conduct all ballast water management operations in accordance with an approved ballast water management plan that meets requirements prescribed by regulation. Requires maintenance of a ballast water record book.

Prohibits the discharge of ballast water in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction except after conducting ballast water exchange in accordance with regulations, using a treatment technology meeting certain requirements, or using environmentally-sound alternative ballast water treatment technology. Allows exceptions, including for safety or stability. Allows waiver for a substantial business hardship. Sets forth exchange and treatment requirements.

Requires notice to vessel owners and operators of any area in waters subject to the U.S. jurisdiction in which vessels may not uptake ballast water due to known conditions.

Regulates the removal or disposition of sediment from spaces designed to carry ballast water.

Requires a report to specified congressional committees on vessel-borne vectors of aquatic nuisance species and pathogens other than ballast water and sediment, including vessel hulls, anchors, and equipment.</summary>
