Requires Yellowstone National Park, since it was established on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park, to be depicted on the first quarter dollar issued and to be designated to the state of Wyoming. Requires: (1) 5 coin designs in each of the first 10 years of either the original period of issuance or the second period of issuance; and (2) 6 coin designs in the 11th year of either the original period of issuance or the second period of issuance.\n\nInstructs the Secretary to strike and make available for sale silver bullion coins that are exact duplicates of such quarter dollars.\n\nAuthorizes the Director of the National Park Service to purchase for resale or distribution numismatic items issued under this Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary to take such actions as are necessary to ensure that minting and issuing coins under this Act will not result in any net cost to the federal government."
