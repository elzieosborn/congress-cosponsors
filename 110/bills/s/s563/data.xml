  <summary date="2007-04-26T18:01:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the REAL ID Act of 2005 to extend the deadline by which: (1) state drivers' licenses and identification cards must meet certain minimum federal standards to be accepted by a federal agency; and (2) a state must meet certain minimum verification standards before issuing such licenses or cards due to the nonavailability of state electronic systems to verify such documents.

Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to reconvene the negotiated rulemaking committee established pursuant to the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004, with the addition of any new interested parties, to: (1) review proposed regulations to implement the minimum document requirements, and the provisions, of the REAL ID Act of 2005; and (2) submit recommendations to the Secretary regarding appropriate modifications to such regulations and such Act.</summary>
