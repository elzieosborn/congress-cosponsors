Requires the Director to report to specified congressional committees on agency efforts to improve diversity in such boards based on information collected by the SES Resource Office.</p> <p>(Sec. 6) Directs each agency to submit to OPM a plan to enhance and maximize opportunities for the advancement and appointment of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities to the SES.
