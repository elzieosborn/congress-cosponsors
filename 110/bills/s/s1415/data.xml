Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), acting through the Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), to expand research programs to identify and improve cancer screening and testing protocols and tools, with particular emphasis on those cancers with the highest incidence of mortality and disability.

Directs the Secretary to award grants for activities to raise public awareness to ensure widespread use of cancer screening programs and access to the best available screening and testing services.

Requires the Director of NIH to: (1) expand cancer survivorship research activities at NCI-designated cancer centers; and (2) provide assistance to such centers for research to evaluate models of survivorship care.</summary>
