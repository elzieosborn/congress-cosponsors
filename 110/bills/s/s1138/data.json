The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nNuclear Safeguards and Supply Act of 2007 - Title I: Nuclear Safeguards and Nuclear Fuel Supply - (Sec. 102) States that it shall be U.S. policy to discourage the development of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities in additional countries, encourage the creation of bilateral and multilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply, and ensure that all supply mechanisms operate in strict accordance with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and do not result in any additional unmet verification burdens for the system.\n\n(Sec. 103) Authorizes additional FY2008 appropriations for the refurbishment or possible replacement of the IAEA Safeguards Analytical Laboratory.\n\nDirects the Secretary of State to report to the appropriate congressional committees respecting such refurbishment or replacement.\n\n(Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary to pursue a program to: (1) strengthen technical safeguards research and development; (2) increase resources, identify near-term technology goals, formulate a technology roadmap, and improve interagency coordination on safeguards technology; and (3) examine proliferation resistance in design and development of all future nuclear energy systems.\n\nTitle II: Nuclear Fuel Supply - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the President to create bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to provide a reliable supply of nuclear fuel to those countries and groups of countries that adhere to policies to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation and that decide to forgo a national uranium enrichment program and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities.\n\n(Sec. 202) Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees respecting the feasibility of establishing an International Nuclear Fuel Authority.\n\n(Sec. 203) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States should support, either in annual voluntary and off-budget contributions to the IAEA, or in the provision of nuclear fuel to the IAEA, a nuclear fuel bank within the IAEA; and (2) a combination of public and private efforts will be necessary to manage the growth of civilian nuclear power in a manner that does not result in undue burdens on the IAEA safeguards system."
