Requires the Secretary to convene a task force to identify vital documents for translation to improve the access of such individuals to federally conducted and federally assisted programs and activities.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) produce such translations and make them available on the HUD website; (2) develop and carry out a plan for providing HUD resources to assist federal funds recipients to improve the access of such individuals to programs and activities; and (3) develop a housing information resource center, with a 24-hour toll-free interpretation service telephone line, which may provide vital documents from competent translation services for housing services providers.

Requires the center to: (1) operate a document clearinghouse; (2) evaluate best-practices models; and (3) provide information relating to culturally and linguistically competent housing services for populations with limited English proficiency.</summary>
