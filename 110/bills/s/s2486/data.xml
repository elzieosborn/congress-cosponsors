  <summary date="2008-03-13T17:10:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act of 2007 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) bar to U.S. admission.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) convene a panel of public health experts to review immigration policies regarding HIV as a communicable disease of public health significance (and thus a health-related ground for inadmissibility); and (2) make a determination and report to Congress regarding the continued listing of HIV as a health-related ground for inadmissibility.</summary>
