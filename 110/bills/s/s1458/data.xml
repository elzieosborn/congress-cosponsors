  <summary date="2007-07-06T21:51:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Agricultural Air Quality Incentives Act of 2007 - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) promote air quality by providing cost-share payments and incentive payments to individual producers to address agricultural air quality concerns; and (2) provide cost-share payments to producers for mobile or stationary equipment (including engines) used in an agricultural operation that would reduce emissions of air pollutants and air pollutant precursors.

Requires a project to be in a county: (1) that is in nonattainment under the Clean Air Act with respect to ambient air quality standards for ozone, particulate matter, or both; (2) in which there is air quality degradation to which agricultural emissions significantly contribute; or (3) in which pesticide drift is a priority concern.

Sets forth project priority criteria.</summary>
