Requires attorney fees to be paid only from appropriations of an agency against which a claim or judgment has been rendered.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to notify the Special Counsel of and report on civil actions taken for arbitrary and capricious rejections of requests for agency records.\n\nSets forth provisions concerning: (1) the tolling of the time limit within which agencies determine whether to comply with a request for records; and (2) refunding search fees if an agency fails to comply with time limits.\n\nRequires each agency to make available its FOIA Public Liaison to assist in resolving requester disputes.\n\nRequires agencies to establish: (1) a system to assign an individual tracking number for each FOIA request that will take longer than ten days to process; and (2) a telephone line or Internet service to provide information on the status of requests.\n\nRevises certain reporting requirements relating to FOIA requests and agency responses.\n\nEstablishes the Office of Government Information Services within the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to: (1) review agency compliance with FOIA policies; (2) recommend policy changes; and (3) offer mediation services between FOIA requesters and administrative agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.\n\nRequires each agency to designate a Chief FOIA Officer and at least one FOIA Public Liaison.\n\nRequires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to report on personnel policies related to FOIA."
