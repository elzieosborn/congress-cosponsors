(Thus requires each loan to be insured individually instead of as part of a bundle of such loans.)\n\nIncreases manufactured home loan limits, requiring annual indexing.\n\nSets forth borrower premium charges, including an up-front premium of up to 2.25% and an annual premium of up to 1%.\n\nRevises requirements for the handling and disposal of any real or personal property conveyed to or acquired by the Secretary.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish underwriting criteria that will ensure the manufactured housing program's financial soundness.\n\nAmends the National Housing Act to apply the prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) to each sale of a manufactured home financed with an FHA-insured loan or extension of credit and related services.\n\nPrescribes certain lease requirements as prerequisites for HUD insurance of a financial institution with respect to a mortgage loan to finance a manufactured home intended to be leased in a manufactured home community."
