  <summary date="2007-12-14T22:23:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">American Home Ownership Preservation Act of 2007 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require certain mortgage originators or lenders with primary responsibility for underwriting an assessment on a home mortgage loan to include a borrower's ability to repay certain associated costs.

Requires a mortgage broker to clearly disclose its relationship to the borrower.

Directs the federal banking agencies to establish a nationwide registry and database system in which all mortgage brokers in the United States must register.



Eliminates prepayment penalties for home mortgages.

Instructs the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make grants to state governments and tribal organizations to assist: (1) programs established for foreclosure mitigation; and (2) housing trust funds supporting low- and moderate-income housing.

Amends the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 to direct the HUD Secretary to establish an annual goal for each government-sponsored enterprise to identify and assist homeowners at risk of default or foreclosure on their mortgage, but who would be able to stabilize the situation with fixed rate 30- or 40-year mortgages.

Authorizes appropriations for mortgage fraud enforcement and prosecution.</summary>
