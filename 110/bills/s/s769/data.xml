  <summary date="2007-03-20T20:02:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Troops to Teachers Improvement Act of 2007 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 with respect to the Troops-to-Teachers program (which provides armed forces veterans with teacher certification stipends in exchange for three years of service in a high-need local educational agency (LEA) or public charter school).

Allows a program participant, if a high-need LEA or public charter school is not located within 50 miles of his or her residence, to teach within an LEA or at a public charter school: (1) experiencing a shortage of highly qualified teachers, especially in science, mathematics, special education, or vocational or technical education; or (2) receiving grant funds because of concentrations of children from low-income families.</summary>
