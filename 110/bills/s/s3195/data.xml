Requires the Secretary to designate a federal entity, or establish a Committee of Federal Partners, to coordinate programs providing such services. Directs such entity or committee to: (1) review how federal programs and efforts that address issues related to the transition of adolescents and young adults with serious mental health disorders may be coordinated to ensure the maximum benefit for the individuals being served; and (2) provide technical assistance to the states who are planning or implementing programs under this Act.</summary>
