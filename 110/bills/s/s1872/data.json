(Under current law, payments are provided if a commodity's effective price is less than its target price.)\n\nProvides recourse loans for covered commodities through crop year 2012.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Risk Management Agency, to identify necessary actions to ensure that federal crop insurance programs are properly rated to account for a rebalancing of risk resulting from enactment of this Act."
