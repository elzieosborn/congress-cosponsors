Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to report to Congress on the status of the Department's investigations of violations alleged to have been committed by contract personnel and findings and recommendations about the Department's capacity and effectiveness in prosecuting misconduct by contract personnel.

Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to ensure, through the creation of Theater Investigative Units, that there are adequate personnel to investigate allegations of criminal violations by contract personnel.</summary>
