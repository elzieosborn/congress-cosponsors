  <summary date="2007-05-14T17:14:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Community Pharmacy Fairness Act of 2007 - Entitles independent pharmacies negotiating contract terms with a health plan for the provision of health care items or services to the same treatment under the antitrust laws as the treatment to which bargaining units recognized under the National Labor Relations Act are entitled. Treats such a pharmacy as an employee engaged in concerted activities in connection with such negotiations.

Exempts actions taken in good faith reliance on this Act from being subject under the antitrust laws to criminal sanctions or civil penalties beyond actual damages incurred.

Confers no new right to participate in any collective cessation of service to patients not already permitted by existing law.

Prohibits: (1) exempting from the antitrust laws any agreement or otherwise unlawful conspiracy that excludes, limits the participation or reimbursement of, or otherwise limits the scope of services to be provided by any independent pharmacy or group of independent pharmacies with respect to the performance of services that are within their scope of practice as defined or permitted by relevant law or regulation; and (2) applying this Act to negotiations between independent pharmacies and health plans pertaining to federal health benefits.</summary>
