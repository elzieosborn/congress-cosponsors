Sets restrictions upon interest rate increases.\n\nLimits penalty rate increases to: (1) seven percentage points above the current interest rate; and (2) future credit extensions only.\n\nProhibits interest charges on fees. Specifies restrictions upon over-the-limit fees.\n\nRequires the primary federal regulator of a card issuer to conduct annual audits of the credit card operations and procedures used by the issuer.\n\nRequires the card issuer to: (1) apply payment first to the card balance bearing the highest rate of interest, and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest, until the payment is exhausted; and (2) apply the payment in the most effective way to minimize the imposition of any finance charge.\n\nRequires a card issuer to define and display the term \"prime rate\" or similar rate or index as the bank prime loan rate posted by a majority of the top 25 U.S. chartered commercial banks, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board).\n\nRevises requirements governing credit card information collected by the Board.\n\nDirects the Board to report annually to Congress its assessment of the profitability of credit card operations of depository institutions."
