  <summary date="2008-11-18T20:41:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">International Space Station Payments Act of 2008 - Amends the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act to exempt from the prohibition on "extraordinary payments'' U.S. government payments made between January 1, 2012, and reentry into Earth's atmosphere of the International Space Station (ISS) at its end of life for work or services necessary to meet U.S. obligations under the Agreement Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station. (Extraordinary payments are, generally, those made for work on the ISS which the Russian government pledged to provide at its expense and those for work on the ISS, or for the purchase of goods or services relating to human space flight, that are not required to be made under the terms of a contract or other agreement that was in effect on January 1, 1999, as the terms were in effect on that date.)

Specifies that such exemption shall not permit payments for: (1) cargo services provided by a Progress vehicle; or (2) crew transportation or rescue services provided by a Soyuz vehicle after the U.S. Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle reaches full operational capability, or a U.S. commercial provider of crew transportation and rescue services demonstrates the capability to meet ISS mission requirements.</summary>
