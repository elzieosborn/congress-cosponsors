  <summary date="2007-07-09T18:07:35Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Directs the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to initiate, under the Trade Act of 1974, an investigation into Canada's personal exemption allowance scheme (no personal exemption from duty for Canadian residents returning from foreign travel lasting less than 24 hours, but an exemption of $50 Canadian for foreign travel lasting between 24 and 48 hours) to: (1) determine whether U.S. rights under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada are being denied by such scheme, or that such act, policy, or practice of Canada violates or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under such agreement or is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce; and (2) report the results of such investigation to Congress, including action the USTR is taking to remedy such scheme. Waives provisions requiring the USTR to consult with private and non-federal sectors prior to initiating an investigation by means other than petition.</summary>
