  <summary date="2007-06-01T20:23:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Violence Against Children Act of 2007 - Amends the federal criminal code to provide for enhanced penalties for violent crimes against children (i.e., persons under 18 years of age).

Requires the Attorney General to: (1) provide assistance to state, local, and Indian tribal governments in the criminal investigation or prosecution of any felony crime of violence against children; and (2) award grants to develop and strengthen effective law enforcement and prosecution of crimes against children and to provide education, prevention, intervention, and victims' assistance services for such crimes.

Requires states receiving grants under this Act or other federal assistance to: (1) use the National Incident-Based Reporting System; (2) enact a statute to allow a parent to leave a newborn baby at a hospital anonymously without penalties; and (3) report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the well-being of children under their care.

Requires the Secretary to develop model training and caseload standards for child guardians in child abuse and neglect cases.

Mynisha's Law - Authorizes any local or tribal government to apply to the Attorney General for designation as a high intensity interstate gang area. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish criteria for reviewing such applications; and (2) establish an Interagency Gang Prevention Task Force to coordinate federal assistance to such high intensity interstate gang areas.

Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow the use of school security grants for: (1) the placement of surveillance equipment in schools; (2) the establishment of hotlines or tiplines for reporting potentially dangerous students and situations; and (3) capital improvements to make school facilities more secure.</summary>
