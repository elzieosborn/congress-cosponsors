  <summary date="2007-10-16T20:47:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Stop Senior Suicide Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Interagency Geriatric Mental Health Planning Council to coordinate and collaborate on the planning for the delivery of mental health services, to include suicide prevention, to older adults.

Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to remove provisions that limit payment for the treatment of mental, psychoneurotic, and personality disorders of an individual who is not an inpatient of a hospital at the time such expenses are incurred.

Requires the Secretary to award grants or cooperative agreements to eligible entities to develop strategies for addressing suicide among the elderly.

Revises provisions requiring centers to provide appropriate information, training, and technical assistance on youth suicide to require such information, training, and assistance on suicide among all ages, particularly for groups that are at a high risk for suicide. Authorizes additional appropriations to carry out such changes.</summary>
