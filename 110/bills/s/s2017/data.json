    "text": "Energy Efficient Lighting for a Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2007 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to establish new efficiency standards for incandescent lighting.\n\nRedefines the term \"general service incandescent lamp.\" Requires general service incandescent lamps, intermediate base incandescent lamps, and candelabra base incandescent lamps to meet specified lamp efficacy, maximum wattage, and Color Rendering Index (CRI) standards. Requires a specified maximum wattage and CRI for certain frosted, clear, and soft white lamps and modified spectrum lamps.\n\nAuthorizes any person to petition to the Secretary of Energy to: (1) exempt types of general service lamps from efficiency requirements; and (2) establish standards for lamp types that are excluded from the definition of general service lamps.\n\nRequires the Secretary, by specified dates, to initiate rulemakings concerning energy efficiency standards for general service incandescent lamps, rough service lamps, vibration service lamps, three-way incandescent lamps, 150-watt general service incandescent lamps, and shatter-resistant lamps. Sets forth specific efficiency standards that become effective if the Secretary fails to complete such rulemakings on specified dates.\n\nRequires the Secretary to initiate rulemakings concerning lamp labeling.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) conduct an annual assessment of the market for general service lamps and compact fluorescent lamps; and (2) carry out an awareness, information, and education program to help consumers understand lamp labels and make energy-efficient lighting choices.\n\nProvides for a state preemption rule for energy conservation standards for general service incandescent lamps, intermediate base incandescent lamps, and candelabra base lamps.\n\nMakes it unlawful for any manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler to distribute adapters that: (1) allow incandescent lamps that do not have medium screw bases to be installed into fixtures or lampholders with such base sockets; and (2) have a voltage range that includes 110 and 130 volts.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to carry out a lighting technology research and development program.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit to Congress a report describing recommendations relating to the means by which the federal government may reduce or prevent the release of mercury during the manufacture, transportation, storage, or disposal of light bulbs.\n\nSets forth requirements concerning metal halide lamp fixtures and ballasts. Provides for a preemption rule for regulations concerning such fixtures adopted by the California Energy Commission on or before January 1, 2011."
