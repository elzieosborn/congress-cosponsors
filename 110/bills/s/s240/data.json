Directs that mapping priorities be based in part on the needs of the Department of the Interior land management agencies.\n\nModifies the composition of the advisory committee and increases the number of members on such committee. Requires the advisory committee to provide a scientific overview of geologic maps (including maps of geologic-based hazards) used or disseminated by federal agencies for regulation or land-use planning. Directs that the national geologic map database include all maps developed with funding provided by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, including under the federal, state, and education components.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for each of FY2007 through FY2016. Increases the percentages allocated for the state and education components."
