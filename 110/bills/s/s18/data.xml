Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) take action to address deficiencies identified by the SIG or another auditor engaged by the TARP; or (2) certify to appropriate congressional committees that no action is necessary or appropriate.

Revises the duties of the SIG to conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations to: (1) eliminate the limitation of the object of investigations to the purchase, management, and sale of troubled assets by the Secretary and the Secretary's management of the program to guarantee such assets; and (2) extend the objects of investigation to any activities of the Secretary in the expenditure or obligation of funds under such Act.

Requires the SIG to report to specified congressional committees by July 1, 2009, on the use of any funds received by an financial institution under TARP.
