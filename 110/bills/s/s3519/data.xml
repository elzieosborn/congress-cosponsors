Exempts from requirements to obtain a license as an animal dealer or exhibitor under such Act any retail pet store or other person who: (1) does not breed or raise more than 50 dogs for use as pets during any one-year period; and (2) derives less than a substantial portion of their income from the breeding and raising of dogs or cats on their own premises and sells such dogs or cats to a dealer or research facility.

Requires: (1) a dealer to provide each dog it holds that is 12 weeks or older with a minimum of two exercise periods during each day for a total of no less than one hour of exercise; (2) such exercise to include removing the dog from the dog's primary enclosure and allowing the dog to walk for the entire exercise period; and (3) such exercise to not include use of a treadmill, catmill, jenny mill, slat mill, or similar device, unless prescribed by a doctor of veterinary medicine.</summary>
