Defines &quot;core requirements&quot; as certain requirements relating to the protection of juveniles against placement in adult prison facilities and the treatment of juveniles equitably on the basis of gender, race, family income, and disability. Defines &quot;evidence based&quot; as a program or practice that is demonstrated to be effective and that: (1) is based on a clearly articulated and empirically supported theory; (2) has measurable outcomes; and (3) has been scientifically tested.</p><p><b>Title II: Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention</b> - (Sec. 201) Revises the date on which the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention must issue the annual plan for coordinating federal juvenile justice efforts. </p><p>(Sec. 202) Revises and increases the membership of the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to include mental health professionals.
