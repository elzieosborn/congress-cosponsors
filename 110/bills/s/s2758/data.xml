  <summary date="2008-05-13T21:15:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">American Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008 - Authorizes the exploration, leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain in Alaska.

Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a competitive oil and gas leasing program for oil and gas exploration, development, and production in the Coastal Plain.

Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to repeal the prohibition against production of oil and gas from Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

States that, in connection with specified environmental protection laws, the Secretary shall not be required to: (1) identify nonleasing alternative courses of action; or (2) analyze the environmental effects of those actions.

Authorizes the Secretary to designate not more than 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as a special area (including the Sadlerochit Spring area).

Prohibits surface occupancy of land comprising the special area if the Secretary leases all or a portion of such special area for oil and gas exploration and development.

Authorizes the Secretary to lease all or a portion of a special area under terms that permit the use of horizontal drilling technology from sites on leases located outside the special area (directional drilling).

Sets forth procedures for lease sales and lease grants.

Prohibits the Secretary from closing land within the Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing, exploration, or development, except in accordance with this Act.

Sets forth procedures for: (1) Coastal Plain environmental protection; (2) expedited judicial review; (3) rights-of-way and easements; and (4) local government impact aid and community service assistance.

Prohibits exportation of oil or gas produced under the leases granted under this Act.</summary>
