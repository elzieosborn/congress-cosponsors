Prohibits the use of funds for any infrastructure, commercial and economic development, and housing operating costs.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, during 2011, to conduct, and report to Congress no later than December 31, 2011, on a review of such program's results to determine: (1) the housing constructed, acquired, or rehabilitated under the program and the effects of such housing on costs to low-income families of affordable housing; (2) the effectiveness of each recipient in achieving the results intended to be achieved, as set forth in the Indian housing plan for the Indian tribe; and (3) the need for, and effectiveness of, extending the duration of the program and increasing the amount of grants that may be used under the program.\n\n(Sec. 4) Declares that NAHASDA does not prohibit or prevent any insular area or participating jurisdiction from providing amounts to Indian tribes or tribally designated housing entities for use in accordance with the HOME Investment Partnership Act.\n\n(Sec. 5) Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the effectiveness of NAHASDA in meeting the needs for affordable housing for low-income Indian families\n\n(Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to carry out training and information activities that include conducting educational seminars with tribes and tribally designated housing entities on how to utilize the loan guarantee program.\n\nExtends through FY2012 the aggregate fiscal year limitation with regard to federal guarantees for financing tribal housing activities. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012 for: (1) the costs of making such guarantees; (2) training and technical assistance to Indian housing authorities and tribally designated housing entities; and (3) block grants for affordable housing activities for Native Hawaiian families who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands.\n\n(Sec. 9) Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee notes and obligations issued by Indian tribes or tribally designated housing entities with tribal approval to finance activities carried out on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas that are eligible for financing under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Requires no less than 70% of the aggregate funds received by an Indian tribe from a guaranteed loan to be used for the support of activities that benefit low-income Indian families.\n\n Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish underwriting criteria and other requirements to ensure the financial soundness of the loan guarantee program and the repayment of loans; and (2) carry out training and information activities with respect to the guarantee program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-2012. Imposes limitations on the amount of loan guarantees, including: (1) an annual fiscal year limitation of $200 million for FY2008-FY2012; and (2) an aggregate limitation on outstanding guarantees of $1 billion.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report to Congress on the loan guarantee program within four years after the enactment of this Act.\n\nTerminates the Secretary's authority to make new loan guarantees on October 1, 2012.\n\n(Sec. 10) Prohibits the use of funds under this Act to employ unauthorized aliens."
