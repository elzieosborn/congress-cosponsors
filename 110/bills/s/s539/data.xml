Authorizes the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make economic injury disaster loans to small businesses located within disaster areas declared as a result of such hurricanes that suffered economic injury from the slowdown in travel and tourism in such areas after such hurricanes.

Establishes in the Treasury the Federal Gulf Coast Travel and Meetings Fund to pay for lodging, meals, travel, and other expenses associated with conventions, conferences, meetings, etc. attended by no fewer than 100 federal employees and occurring within such disaster areas.</summary>
