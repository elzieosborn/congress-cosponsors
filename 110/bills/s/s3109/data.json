Sets forth investment, auditing, and reporting requirements for the Fund.\n\nRequires the Administrator to establish the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Governing Board to assess the effectiveness of, and make recommendations for improving, the electronic manifest system.\n\nRequires a facility that receives hazardous waste in states that require tracking through a hazardous waste manifest to: (1) complete the facility portion of the applicable manifest; (2) sign and date the facility certification; and (3) submit to the system a final copy of the manifest."
