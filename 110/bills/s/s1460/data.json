Sets forth transition options for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers.\n\nMakes socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers eligible for cost sharing under the conservation security program and the environmental quality incentives program.\n\nAmends the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act to include among \"high priority research\" areas of concern to beginning farmers or ranchers.\n\nAmends the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 to include farm transfer options for beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers among priority grant areas.\n\nAmends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to provide emphasis on risk management education for beginning, immigrant, retiring, or socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers."
