  <summary date="2007-12-18T22:48:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Imported Food Security Act of 2007 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) assess and collect fees on food imported into the United States; (2) provide for research on the development of tests of imported food and sampling methodologies; (3) give priority to tests that are suitable for inspections of food at U.S. ports of entry; (4) establish goals of developing certain tests for specified pathogens or substances; and (5) establish a certification system for a foreign government or foreign food establishment seeking to import food to the United States.

Authorizes the Secretary to withdraw such certification of any food if: (1) such food is linked to an outbreak of human illness; (2) the food safety programs or procedures are no longer equivalent to U.S. programs and procedures; or (3) there is a refusal to allow U.S. officials to conduct audits and investigations as may be necessary.

Directs the Secretary to routinely inspect food and food animals before entry into the United States.

Authorizes the Secretary to deny importation of food from: (1) any foreign government that does not permit U.S. audits and inspections; and (2) any foreign government or foreign firm that does not consent to an investigation by the Secretary when food from that country or firm is linked to a food-borne illness outbreak or is otherwise found to be adulterated or mislabeled.

Provides that any food imported for consumption in the United States may be detained, seized, or condemned.

Directs the Secretary to establish a transitional food safety import review program.</summary>
