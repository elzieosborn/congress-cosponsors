Declares that such payment and refund authority does not affect the Secretary's authority to establish, change, and abolish reasonable filing and service fees, charges, and commissions, require deposits of payments, and provide refunds under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.\n\nAuthorizes the Federal Coordinator to use amounts collected under such authority without further appropriation.\n\nGrants the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any determination, permit, approval, authorization, review, or other related action taken under federal law relating to an Alaska natural gas transportation project."
