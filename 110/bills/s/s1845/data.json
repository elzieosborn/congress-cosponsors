Defines \"covered White House officer\" as the President, the Vice-President, the Counsel to the President, and the Counselor to the President.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to submit semi-annual reports to the Judiciary Committees of Congress listing the name and title of each DOJ officer or employee who made a covered communication with any officer or employee of the Executive Office of the President in the previous six-month period. Requires the Counsel to the President to make the same semi-annual reports listing the name and title of each officer or employee of the Executive Office of the President who made a covered communication with any DOJ officer or employee. Allows the exclusion of covered DOJ and White House officers from such reports."
