Increases the annual national limitation for such bonds to $5 billion between 2009 and 2014.\n\nExtends through 2016 the tax credit for residential energy efficient property expenditures. Eliminates the 30% limitation on solar electric property expenditures. Allows such credit for energy storage air conditioner property used in a principal residence. Calculates the maximum allowable amounts of such credit for solar property based upon kilowatt capacity.\n\nExtends through 2016 the energy investment tax credit.\n\nExtends through 2012 the tax credits for: (1) nonbusiness energy property expenditures; and (2) new energy efficient homes.\n\nExtends through 2014 the tax deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings. Increases the rate of such deduction to $2.25 per square foot.\n\nAssigns a five-year recovery period for the depreciation of any qualified energy management device (\"smart meter\") that is placed in service before 2012 and that measures and records electricity usage data on a time-differentiated basis of at least 10 minutes."
