  <summary date="2008-10-14T18:31:55Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) restore the unified credit against the estate and gift tax after 2009; (2) establish the amount of such credit at $3.5 million adjusted for inflation in calendar years after 2010; and (3) reduce the maximum estate and gift tax rate to 45%.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that any reduction in federal revenues resulting from this Act should be fully offset.</summary>
