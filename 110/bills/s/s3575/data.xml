Declares a person to have knowingly or willfully violated the requirements of this Act if the person: (1) purposefully fails to make a disclosure required by this Act; or (2) makes a disclosure with the intent to deceive.

Provides that a reasonable basis determination of nutrition information shall be required only once per standard food item if certain requirements are met.
