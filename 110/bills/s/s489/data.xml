  <summary date="2007-04-11T19:49:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Green Buildings Act of 2007 - Directs the Administrator of General Services to establish a position of, and appoint, a Director who shall: (1) establish an Office of Green Buildings (2) establish a Green Building Advisory Committee; (2) carry out public outreach; (3) develop and recommend a green building research plan; (4) analyze current budget and contracting practices that affect achievement of green buildings; and (5) develop and implement a comprehensive indoor air quality program for federal facilities.

Defines a "green building" as one that, during its life-cycle: (1) reduces energy, water, and material resource use and the generation of waste; (2) improves indoor environmental quality; (3) improves impacts of the building on human health and the environment; (4) increases the use of environmentally preferable products; (5) increases reuse and recycling opportunities; and (6) integrates systems in the building.

Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide grants to state educational agencies for use in: (1) providing technical assistance for EPA's programs (including the Tools for Schools Program and the Healthy School Environmental Assessment Tool) to schools for use in addressing environmental issues; and (2) developing state school environmental quality plans. Authorizes the EPA to provide grants to nonprofit organizations to assist in community and public education on healthy school environments.

Requires the EPA to develop voluntary school site acquisition guidelines that account for: (1) efficient use of energy; (2) the special vulnerability of children to hazardous substances or pollution exposure where the potential for site contamination exists; (3) available modes of transportation; and (4) potential use of the school as an emergency shelter.

Requires the Director to: (1) identify incentives to encourage the use of green buildings and related technology in federal government operations; and (2) consult with the Committee to assist in the implementation of the Environmental Stewardship Scorecard.

Requires the Office to carry out specified demonstration projects at federal buildings and universities to contribute to its research goals.</summary>
