Requires the United States to initiate such activities on a government-to-government basis.\n\nDefines a Destination of Diversion Concern as any country whose government is directly involved in the transshipment, reexportation, or diversion of U.S.-originating controlled items to unverifiable end users or to Iran, or that has failed to adequately strengthen its export control systems.\n\nRequires a license to export to a country designated a Destination of Diversion Concern controlled items that could contribute to Iran's obtaining nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, or its support for acts of international terrorism.\n\nRequires the Director to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) any country that may be transshipping, reexporting, or diverting controlled items to a country other than Iran if such other country is seeking to obtain nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, defense technologies, components for improvised explosive devices (IEDs), or other defense items, or provides support for acts of international terrorism; and (2) the feasibility and advisability of including such countries in the system for designating countries as Destinations of Possible Diversion Concern and Destinations of Diversion Concern."
