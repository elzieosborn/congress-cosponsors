Includes repair or replacement of prosthetic devices and components within such coverage.\n\nProhibits a group health plan from imposing any annual or lifetime dollar limitation on benefits for prosthetic devices and components required to be covered under this Act that is not applied in the aggregate to all medical and surgical benefits provided under the plan.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Labor to: (1) assist enrollees with any questions or problems regarding compliance with the requirements of this Act; and (2) conduct random audits of group health plans to ensure compliance.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to evaluate the effects of this Act, including on the cost of and access to heath insurance coverage."
