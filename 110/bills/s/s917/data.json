Instructs the Secretary to consult with the Colorado Division of Wildlife regarding potential participation by it in carrying out such Plan.\n\nProhibits anything in this Act from applying to a taking of wildlife (within the meaning of \"take\" under the Endangered Species Act of 1973) within Rocky Mountain National Park for any purpose other than the implementation of the Elk and Vegetation Management Plan."
