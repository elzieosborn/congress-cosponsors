  <summary date="2008-01-23T22:58:38Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Citizenship Processing Backlog Reduction Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive the application of provisions relating to annuities and pay on reemployment or any similar legal provision under a government retirement system on a case-by-case basis for an annuitant reemployed on a temporary basis if: (1) such waiver is necessary due to an emergency involving a direct threat to life or property or other unusual circumstances; or (2) the annuitant is employed in a position that provides assistance to the Secretary with a substantial backlog of naturalization petitions or assistance for processing petitions filed from January 31-July 30, 2007.

Provides that an annuitant as to whom such a waiver is in effect shall not be considered an employee for purposes of any government retirement system.

Terminates the Secretary's authority under this Act regarding naturalization petitions on January 1, 2009. Prohibits an annuitant to whom such a waiver applies from being so employed after January 1, 2010.</summary>
