Directs the Secretary of Defense to report to the congressional defense and appropriations committees on the status of planning for the redeployment of Armed Forces from Iraq. Requires the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to brief such committees on matters contained in the reports.</summary>
