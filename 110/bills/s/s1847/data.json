Allows disclosure without advance notice to a manufacturer or private labeler if the CPSC makes an affirmative determination that: (1) disclosure is necessary to prevent an unreasonable risk to health and safety; and (2) the manufacturer or private labeler is not cooperating with the Commission.\n\nSets a minimum for the penalty imposed on manufacturer, distributor, or retailer which knowingly fails to comply with a recall order.\n\nIncreases from $1.25 million to $20 million the maximum civil penalty that may be imposed under the Act for any related series of prohibited acts."
