  <summary date="2008-11-04T20:36:05Z" status="Reported to Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2008 - Authorizes the President to transfer on a grant basis to: (1) Pakistan, the OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class guided missile frigate MCINERNEY; (2) Greece, the OSPREY class minehunter coastal ships OSPREY and ROBIN; (3) Chile, the KAISER class oiler ANDREW J. HIGGINS; and (4) Peru, the NEWPORT class amphibious tank landing ships FRESNO and RACINE.

States that: (1) the value of such vessels transferred on a grant basis shall not be counted against the aggregate value of excess defense articles transferred to countries in any fiscal year under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; (2) transfer costs shall be charged to the recipient; and (3) to the maximum extent practicable, the country to which a vessel is transferred shall have necessary vessel repair and refurbishment carried out at U.S. shipyards (including U.S. Navy shipyards).

Terminates transfer authority two years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
