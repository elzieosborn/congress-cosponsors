(Sec. 4) Allows the Secretary to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities to carry out demonstration projects to improve emergency medical services in rural areas by increasing communication and coordination with state trauma systems. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to make grants to states, political subdivisions, or consortia thereof to improve access to and enhance the development of trauma care systems. Requires grant funds be used to: (1) integrate and broaden the reach of such a system; (2) strengthen, develop, and improve an existing system; (3) expand communications between the system and emergency medical services through improved equipment or a telemedicine system; (4) improve data collection and retention; or (5) increase education, training, and technical assistance opportunities. Requires the Secretary to give preference in awarding grants to applicants that: (1) have developed a process, using national standards, for designating trauma centers; (2) recognize protocols for the delivery of seriously injured patients to trauma centers; (3) implement a process for evaluating the performance of the trauma system; and (4) agree to participate in specified information systems by collecting, providing, and sharing information. Requires the Secretary to give priority to applicants that will use the grants to focus on improving access to trauma care systems. Requires the Secretary to give special consideration to projects that demonstrate strong state or local support. (Sec. 6) Revises the matching requirements for states to be eligible for grants to improve emergency medical services by decreasing the amount of matching funds required after the fourth and subsequent years of grant payments to the state. (Sec. 7) Prohibits the Secretary from making trauma care grants to a state unless the state's emergency medical services plan coordinates planning for trauma systems with state disaster emergency planning and bioterrorism hospital preparedness planning. Requires the Secretary to update the model plan for the designation of trauma centers and for triage, transfer, and transportation policies. (Sec. 8) Prohibits the Secretary from making trauma grants to a state unless the state submits to the Secretary any changes to, and any plans to address deficiencies in, the trauma care component. (Sec. 9) Removes the requirement that states, in order to receive trauma grant funds, must agree not to expend such payments to purchase any major medical or communication equipment, ambulances, or aircraft. (Sec. 10) Removes provisions related to annual reporting requirements for states. (Sec. 11) Sets forth reporting requirements. (Sec. 12) Authorizes appropriation for FY2008-FY2012. (Sec. 13) Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2012 for residency training programs in emergency medicine."
