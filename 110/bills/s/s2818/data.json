    "text": "Small Business Health Plans Act of 2008 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide for the establishment and governance of small business health plans, which are group health plans sponsored by trade, industry, professional, chamber of commerce, or similar business associations that meet ERISA certification requirements. Requires the Secretary of Labor to: (1) apply the rules and standards of this Act to Alternative Market Pooling Organizations, such as unions, churches, and other groups; and (2) consult with the domicile state regarding the Secretary's exercise of authority over such plans. Allows other existing plans to be treated as small business health plans under certain circumstances. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to promulgate Minimum Standards for premium variations and Model Small Group Rating Rules for plans under this Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary to issue the List of Required Benefits of covered benefits, services, or categories of providers that are required to be provided by health insurance issuers in at least 26 states as a result of state mandate laws. Applies covered benefit, service, or category of provider mandates from the List to states with laws requiring such mandates, but does not apply such mandates from the List to states with no such laws. Supersedes any and all state laws relating to such mandates in the health insurance market.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish the Health Insurance Consensus Standards Board to develop recommendations that harmonize inconsistent state health insurance laws. Provides that any harmonized standards adopted by the Secretary will supersede state laws related to the areas covered by the harmonized standards."
