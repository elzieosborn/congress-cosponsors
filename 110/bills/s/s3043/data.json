Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cost-sharing agreements with states to include any non-federal lands in a state in such cadastre. Limits the federal share of any such agreement to 50% of the total cost to a state for the development of the cadastre of the non-federal lands in the state.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit a report on: (1) existing real property inventories or any components of any cadastre; (2) consolidation of inventories and components; (3) the use of existing inventories and components of any cadastre; (4) the cost savings that will be achieved; and (5) recommendations for legislation."
