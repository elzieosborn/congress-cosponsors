Requires the Commission to submit to Congress, not later than 18 months after this Act's enactment and at least once every 10 years thereafter, a legislative proposal (referred to as the Commission Schedule and Review bill) that includes a schedule of review and abolishment of agencies and programs. Requires such schedule to provide a time line for the Commission's review and proposed abolishment of: (1) at least 25% (as measured in dollars) of unauthorized agencies or programs; and (2) if applicable, at least 25% of the programs identified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through its Program Assessment Rating Tool program (or similar review program) as ineffective or results not demonstrated. Requires agencies performing similar or related functions to be reviewed concurrently.

Sets forth review criteria. Requires the Commission to submit to the Congress and the President every two years a report that analyzes and includes (as appropriate) proposals and legislative provisions to reauthorize, reorganize, consolidate, expand, or transfer each agency and program scheduled for review. Provides for expedited congressional consideration of a resulting bill.</summary>
