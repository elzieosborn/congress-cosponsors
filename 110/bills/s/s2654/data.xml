  <summary date="2008-05-22T19:44:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Citizen Soldier and Military Veteran Travel Reimbursement Act of 2008 - Repeals the requirement that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs adjust the amount (similar to a copay or deductible) charged to a member who is reimbursed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for travel expenses connected with the receipt of vocational rehabilitation, counseling, or required medical care. Requires the Secretary, in determining the amount of the allowance or reimbursement, to use the reimbursement rate for the use of privately-owned vehicles by government employees on official business.

Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to reimburse a member of the reserves for expenses incurred in connection with round-trip travel in excess of 100 miles to an inactive duty training location, requiring the same reimbursement rate as above.</summary>
