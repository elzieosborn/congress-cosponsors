Requires: (1) any assistance or grants provided to New Mexico under this Act to be made on a non-reimbursable basis; and (2) the Secretary, at that state's request, to directly transfer to one or more federal agencies any amounts made available to New Mexico to carry out this Act.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations.
