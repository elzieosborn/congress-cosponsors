    "text": "Energy Research Act of 2007 - Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Administration - Energy (ARPA-E) to reduce foreign energy imports and to improve the competitiveness of the U.S. economy by: (1) promoting revolutionary changes in the critical technologies that would promote energy competitiveness; (2) turning cutting-edge science and engineering into technologies for energy and environmental application; and (3) accelerating innovation in energy and the environment for both traditional and alternative energy sources and in energy efficiency mechanisms to reduce energy use.\n\nRequires the ARPA-E Director to award competitive grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts to institutions of higher education, companies, or consortia of such entities (which may include federally funded research and development centers).\n\nRequires the Director to implement such programs in a manner similar to the Small Business Innovation Research Program in order to ensure that small-business concerns are fully able to participate in the programs.\n\nAuthorizes the Director to carry out a program to award cash prizes in recognition of outstanding achievements with potential application to the mission of ARPA-E."
