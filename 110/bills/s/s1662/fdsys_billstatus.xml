Requires the head of such Office to: (1) administer the NMVC program; (2) advise the Administrator on recommended changes; (3) work to expand the number of small businesses participating in the program; and (4) encourage investment in small manufacturing.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) Modifies the definition of low-income geographic area to reflect the new markets tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) Requires the Administrator, within one year after the enactment of this Act, to prescribe standard documents for an application for final approval of a company under the NMVC program.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) Allows NMVC companies to receive operational assistance grants of the lesser of 10% of the private capital raised by the company or $1 million. Requires the Administrator to grant each conditionally-approved NMVC company up to two years to raise the $5 million in private capital required for participation.</p> <p>(Sec. 206) Reauthorizes the NMVC program for FY2007-FY2010. Reduces from $30 million to $20 million the authorization for operational assistance grants.</p>]]></text>
