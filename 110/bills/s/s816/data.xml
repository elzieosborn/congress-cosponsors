  <summary date="2007-04-02T13:44:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Parents' Tax Relief Act of 2007 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) provide for a minimum tax credit for household and dependent care services for dependents under the age of seven and to phase out such credit based on the amount by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds a threshold amount; (2) increase to $5,000 the amount of the personal tax exemption; (3) eliminate the marriage penalty in all income tax brackets and in the tax deduction for student loan interest; (4) establish a standard tax deduction for expenses related to business usage of a home; (5) make permanent increases in the child tax credit and adjust the amount of such credit for inflation on an annual basis after 2007; (6) allow employers a tax credit for employees who telecommute; and (7) allow an exclusion from employee gross income for employer-provided computer equipment used to work at home.

Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to award social security credits to parents who stay at home, instead of working outside the home, to care for children who are either under age seven. Authorizes transfers from the general fund to specified Social Security trust funds to cover the cost of such credits.</summary>
