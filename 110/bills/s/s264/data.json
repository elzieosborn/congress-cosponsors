Prohibits crediting against the federal share: (1) any expenditure by the Bonneville Power Administration in the Wallowa River watershed; or (2) expenditures made by individual agricultural producers in any federal commodity or conservation program. Requires the Secretary, in carrying out this Act, to comply with applicable Oregon state water law. Prohibits the federal government from holding title to, or being responsible for the operation and maintenance of, any facility rehabilitated or constructed under this Act.\n\nDeclares that activities funded under this Act shall not be considered a supplemental or additional benefit under federal reclamation law.\n\n Authorizes appropriations.\n\nTerminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this Act 10 years after its enactment."
