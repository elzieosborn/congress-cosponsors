Requires the Secretary to take into consideration whether the manufacturer is making efforts toward correcting the violation in determining the amount of the civil penalty.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to order notification of health personnel and other relevant persons if a violation of postmarket surveillance requirements of a device presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health, such notification is necessary to eliminate such risk, and no more practicable means is available to eliminate such risk."
