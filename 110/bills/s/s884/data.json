Sets forth criteria that must be met if such a grant is used for a family drug treatment program that is an alternative to incarceration.\n\nGives priority in awarding grants under this Act to any entity that agrees to use the award for programs serving an area that: (1) is a rural area, an area with a shortage of mental health professionals, or an area with a shortage of family-based substance abuse treatment options; and (2) has high rates of addiction to methamphetamine or other drugs."
