Requires the Secretary to grant such waivers for a period that is not less than one year but not more than two years. Allows the Secretary to extend a waiver, upon request of a state, for one additional period if the Secretary reviews performance under the waiver and determines that the waiver requirements have been and will continue to be met.\n\nRequires the Secretary to include as part of the evaluations of the activities carried out pursuant to breast and cervical cancer grants: (1) the total amount of dollars leveraged annually from non-federal entities in states receiving a waiver and how these amounts were used; (2) for states receiving a waiver, the percentages of the grant expended on screening and referral services and on other services or activities; (3) the number of states receiving waivers annually; (4) the number of women receiving screening and referral services in programs before and after the granting of a waiver; (5) the average annual level of state fiscal expenditures for such services for the year preceding the grant of the waiver; and (6) the amount of non-federal contributions by the state according to source and the proportion of non-federal funds to federal funds. Prohibits the use of amounts to which a waiver applies to increase the number of salaried employees.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from granting a waiver or extension under this Act after September 30, 2012.\n\nSets forth reporting requirements.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for breast and cervical cancer grants from FY2008-FY2012."
