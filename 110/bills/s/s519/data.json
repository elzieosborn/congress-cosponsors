Requires the Center to forward each report which it receives from a service provider to a designated law enforcement agency.\n\nRequires service providers to preserve images of child pornography for evidentiary purposes.\n\nGrants service providers and the Center immunity from civil claims or criminal charges for complying the requirements of this Act, except for certain intentional or reckless misconduct.\n\nRequires the U.S. Trade Representative, the Attorney General, and other relevant federal officials to encourage foreign governments to combat child sexual exploitation and pornography.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for grants to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.\n\nAuthorizes courts to order monitoring of Internet use by a convicted sex offender as a condition for such offender's supervised release.\n\nImposes enhanced criminal penalties for use of the Internet to violate child pornography or sexual exploitation laws.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to make publicly available reports on investigations and prosecutions of child sexual exploitation crimes."
