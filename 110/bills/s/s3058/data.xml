Prohibits the importation of products from the DRC that contain or are derived from columbite-tantalite or cassiterite, including such products that are mined or produced and benefit such groups, until the President certifies to Congress that such violations and crimes have ceased.

Makes it unlawful for a person to violate such prohibition. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for such violations, including seizure and forfeiture for any violations of other U.S. customs laws.</summary>
