    "text": "Makes permanent the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for any illness to a veteran who participated in a test conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD) Deseret Test Center as part of a program for chemical and biological warfare testing from 1962 through 1973 (including Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense [SHAD] and related land-based tests), notwithstanding that there is insufficient medical evidence to conclude that the illness is attributable to such testing. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to conduct an expanded study on the health impact of Project SHAD. Requires the study to include, as practicable, all veterans who participated in Project SHAD."
