        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Aviation Investment and Modernization Act of 2007 - <b>Title I: Authorizations and Financing - </b>(Sec. 101) Amends federal transportation law to authorize appropriations for FY2008-FY2011 for: (1) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations; (2) FAA air navigation facilities and equipment; (3) civil aviation research and development (R&amp;D); (4) airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning programs; (5) certain other aviation programs; and (6) administrative expenses for certain airport programs.<br> </p> <p>(Sec. 106) Directs the FAA to impose, with specified exceptions, a surcharge of $25 per flight on owners or operators of passenger aircraft and to deposit such amounts in an Air Modernization Fund to modernize the air traffic control system and implement Next Generation Air Transportation System projects. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to borrow up to $5 billion to finance capital investments in the FAA's air traffic control system.</p> <p><b>Title II: Airport Improvements - </b>(Sec. 201) Revises passenger facility charge (PFC) provisions granting an eligible agency (a public agency that controls a commercial service airport) the authority to impose a PFC on passengers boarding an aircraft, including requiring such agency to: (1) submit annually to air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at the airport, and make available to the public, a status report on the agency's PFC program; and (2) obtain approval from the Secretary before imposing a PFC to finance an intermodal ground access project or increasing a PFC.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary to establish and conduct an alternative PFC collection pilot program under which an eligible agency may impose a PFC without regard to dollar amount limitations, provided such agency collects the PFC from a passenger at the airport via the Internet, or in any other reasonable manner.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) Revises certain assurances required to be made before being eligible for an airport improvement program grant. </p> <p>(Sec. 204) Sets, for a specified period, the government's share of project costs at no more than 95% for an airport improvement project at a small hub airport that has subsequently been reclassified as a medium hub airport.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) Makes the cost of relocating or replacing an airport due to a change in design standards that is beyond the control of an airport owner or operator an allowable project cost under the airport improvement program.</p> <p>(Sec. 206) Provides that certain restrictions on the use of proceeds from the sale of a private airport to a public entity shall not apply.</p> <p>(Sec. 207) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to carry out a pilot program at not more than 10 airports to take over operational responsibility for airport terminal area air navigation equipment. </p> <p>(Sec. 208) Sets the government's share of project costs at 95% (under current law, 90%) for certain airport improvement projects at certain airports.</p> <p>(Sec. 209) Sets forth provisions: (1) making Afghanistan-Iraq war veterans eligible for the veteran's hiring preference on airport improvement projects; (2) increasing the apportionment of airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning and program funds to certain cargo airports to 4.0% each fiscal year; (3) making the construction of parking pads for mobile refuelers used while refueling aircraft at non-primary airports eligible for airport improvement program funding; (4) requiring a minimum discretionary funding level of $520 million for airport improvement programs in a fiscal year; and (5) revising criteria used in calculating the apportionment of airport improvement program funds to certain airports.</p> <p>(Sec. 210) Requires states participating in the state block grant program to comply with certain grant requirements in administering non-primary airport projects, including federal environmental requirements or an agreed upon equivalent.</p> <p>(Sec. 211) Provides for airport improvement program funding of special environmental studies for federally-funded airport projects or special studies or reviews to support approved noise mitigation programs or environmental mitigation in a FAA Record of Decision or Finding of No Significant Impact.</p> <p>(Sec. 212) Authorizes the Secretary to make airport improvement program grants to airport operators to assist in completing environmental review and assessment activities for implementation of proposed flight procedures under the airport noise compatibility planning program.</p> <p>(Sec. 213) Makes current or former military airports that are found to be critical to the safety of trans-oceanic air traffic eligible for certain discretionary grant funding used to develop current or former airports and improve the capacity of the national air transportation system.</p> <p>(Sec. 214) Allows a PFC imposed at a large hub airport (that is subject to an amended judgment and final order in condemnation filed on January 7, 1980, by the Superior Court of the State of California for the county of Los Angeles) to be used as an eligible project cost to carry out noise mitigation for certain school buildings in the noise impacted area surrounding the airport if: (1) the buildings are adversely affected by airport noise;
