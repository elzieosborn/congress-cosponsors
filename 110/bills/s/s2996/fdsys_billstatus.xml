        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p><p>Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 - <b>Title I: Budget and Personnel Authorizations</b> - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY2009 for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI); (2) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (3) Department of Defense (DOD); (4) Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (5) National Security Agency (NSA); (6) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (7) Coast Guard; (8) Departments of State, the Treasury, Energy, and Justice; (9) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (10) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); (11) National Reconnaissance Office (NRO); (12) National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGIA); and (13) Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>(Sec. 102) Specifies that the amounts authorized and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 2009, for such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees and the President.</p><p>(Sec. 103) Allows the DNI, with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2009 (by not more than 5%) when necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Authorizes the DNI to convert to performance by intelligence community (IC) personnel activities currently performed by contractor employees. Requires notification of the congressional intelligence committees in either case.</p><p>(Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account of the DNI for FY2009, as well as for full-time personnel for elements within such Account.</p><p><b>Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System</b> - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2009 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.</p><p><b>Title III: General Intelligence Community Matters - Subtitle A: Personnel Matters </b>- (Sec. 301) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law.</p><p>(Sec. 302) Allows a federal officer or employee or member of the Armed Forces, after FY2008, to be detailed to the staff of an element of the IC funded through the Community Management Account from another element of the federal government on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, as jointly agreed upon by the DNI and the head of the detailing element, for a period of up to three years.</p><p>(Sec. 303) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to authorize the DNI to: (1) convert competitive service positions within an IC element to excepted service positions as necessary to carry out intelligence functions; and (2) establish the classification and rates of pay for the converted positions.
