Requires the Secretary to establish the National Neurotechnology Coordination Office and the National Neurotechnology Advisory Council.

Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop the Blueprint for Neuroscience Research to: (1) identify pervasive challenges in neuroscience and any technological barriers to solving such challenges; and (2) support the development of new tools, training opportunities, and other resources to assist neuroscientists in basic and clinical research.

Directs the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to require the Directors of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to improve the timelines of the review process for neurology and psychiatry.
