        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Safe Truck Operations and Preservation Act - Prohibits a state from prescribing or enforcing any regulation that allows a restricted property-carrying unit (including a trailer or semi-trailer, except one used exclusively for fire-fighting) to operate on the National Highway System (NHS) (including the Interstate System), unless its operation is authorized by the state on June 1, 2003, and in actual and lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including seasonal operations) on or before that date. </p> <p>Prohibits a state from allowing the operation of a commercial motor vehicle combination on the NHS (except a vehicle or load with a special state permit that cannot be dismantled or divided easily) with more than one property-carrying unit (excluding truck tractor) whose property-carrying units are more than: (1) the maximum combination trailer, semi-trailer, or other type of length limitation allowed by state law on June 1, 2003; or (2) the length of the property-carrying units of those commercial motor vehicle combinations, by specific configuration, in actual and lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis (including continual seasonal operation) in such state on or before June 1, 2003. <p> Prohibits a state from allowing the operation of a vehicle or combination (other than a longer combination vehicle) exceeding Interstate weight limits on the Interstate System more than one year after enactment of this Act, unless its operation was lawful: (1) on July 1, 1956; (2) in the case of the overall gross weight of any group of two or more consecutive axles, on the date of enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Amendments of 1974; or (3) under a special permit pursuant to state (grandfather) law. <p>Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to waive or limit vehicle weight limits during periods of national emergency. <p>Declares that Interstate weight limitations on vehicles and combinations (other than longer combination vehicles) that operate on the Interstate System shall also apply to those operating on non-Interstate segments of the NHS, unless: (1) such segments are subject to lower state weight limits; or (2) a state allows the operation of any vehicle or combination on an existing non-Interstate segment of the NHS that could be so operated lawfully on June 1, 2003.]]></text>
