Requires them to purchase or securitize mortgage investments and to improve the distribution of investment capital available for mortgage financing for underserved markets such as: (1) manufactured housing; (2) affordable housing preservation; (3) subprime borrowers; (4) community development financial institutions; (5) assisting depository institutions in meeting their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act; and (6) rural and other underserved markets.</p> <p>Revises requirements for monitoring and enforcing compliance with such housing goals.</p> <p>Requires the enterprises to set aside and allocate certain of their funds for the affordable housing program of block grants to states to assist low- and moderate-income borrowers facing foreclosure or to make foreclosed property available to low- and moderate-income homebuyers.</p> <p>Establishes in the Treasury within the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund a Capital Magnet Fund to carry out a competitive grant program to attract private capital for and increase investment in: (1) the development, preservation, rehabilitation, and purchase of affordable housing for primarily extremely low-, very low-, and low-income families; and (2) certain economic development activities or community service facilities.</p> <p>Revises requirements for: (1) the issuance of cease-and-desist orders; and (2) the imposition of civil money penalties on the enterprises for failure to meeting housing goals.</p> <p></p>]]></text>
