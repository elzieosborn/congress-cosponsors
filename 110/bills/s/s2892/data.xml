Wartime Enforcement of Fraud Act of 2008 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions that suspend the statute of limitations for wartime frauds against the United States by: (1) making such provisions applicable to an authorization for the use of Armed Forces (currently, applicable only if a war has been declared); (2) extending such limitation period from three to five years after the termination of hostilities; and (3) requiring a presidential proclamation, with notice to Congress, to signal the end of hostilities and thus end the suspension of the statute of limitations.</summary>
