Requires tribal ordinances to provide the Commission will conduct background investigations on tribal gaming commissioners, key tribal gaming employees, primary management officials, and key employees of the gaming enterprise.\n\nRevises the cap on the total fees to be paid to the Commission during any fiscal year by gaming operations conducting regulated class II and III gaming activities.\n\nRequires Indian tribes, before using lands for class II or III gaming, to: (1) submit to the Secretary an environmental impact statement; and (2) obtain the Secretary's consent with respect to the change in use of the lands."
