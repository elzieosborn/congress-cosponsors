 Sets forth requirements for cooperatives, including that they: (1) are nonprofit, wholly owned, and democratically governed by its member-employers; (2) exist solely to serve the membership base; (3) assist members in pooling their health care insurance purchasing power; (4) provide data to improve the ability of the members to make data-based decisions regarding their health plans; and (5) conduct activities to enhance quality improvement in the health care community. Requires the Secretary to carry out an identical grant program for eligible groups of two or more employers that have 99 employees or less and purchase health insurance for their employees.</summary>
