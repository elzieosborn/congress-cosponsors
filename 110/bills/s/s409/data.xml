Directs the Secretary to enter into local cooperation agreements with non-federal interests for project design and construction. Sets the federal share of project costs under local cooperation agreements at 75%.

Requires a reduction in the non-federal share of the cost of constructing projects under this Act, using a federal formula for water rate affordability, where the rate for affordability relating to the project area exceeds the average state-wide rate by a specified percentage.
