Sets the federal share of project costs under local cooperation agreements at 75%.\n\nRequires a reduction in the non-federal share of the cost of constructing projects under this Act, using a federal formula for water rate affordability, where the rate for affordability relating to the project area exceeds the average state-wide rate by a specified percentage.\n\nSets the non-federal share of operation and maintenance costs for projects constructed with assistance under this Act at 100%."
