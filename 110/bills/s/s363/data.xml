  <summary date="2007-03-16T19:43:23Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Hope Offered through Principled, Ethically-Sound Stem Cell Research Act or the HOPE Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct and support research to develop techniques for the isolation, derivation, production, or testing of pluripotent stem cells that have the flexibility of embryonic stem cells and that may result in improved understanding of, or treatments for, diseases and other adverse health conditions, provided that such techniques do not involve: (1) the creation of a viable human embryo for research purposes; (2) the destruction or discarding of a human embryo; or (3) knowingly subjecting a human embryo to risk of injury or death greater than that allowed on fetuses in utero.

Establishes the National Stem Cell Research Review Board to: (1) monitor research to ensure that it is in compliance with this Act; (2) prioritize research with the greatest potential for near term benefits; and (3) ensure fair consideration of both embryonic and adult stem cell research for funding.

Sets forth consent requirements for the donation of materials for research.

Applies federal provisions protecting individually identifiable health information to donors.

Amends the National Organ Transplant Act to prohibit the transfer of any human ovum, human blastocyst, human embryo, or stem cell derived from a human embryo for valuable consideration.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit any person from knowingly receiving any valuable consideration for any therapy that: (1) affects interstate commerce or is funded by federal assistance; and (2) utilizes cells from a human embryo if the process of deriving such cells destroyed the embryo.</summary>
