  <summary date="2007-12-20T23:05:52Z" status="Introduced in House">Condemns the Saudi judiciary for convicting the "Qatif Girl" on the charge of being alone in a car with a man she is not related to, as well as for the inhumane punishment to which she was sentenced.

Calls on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to: (1) overturn the conviction and to drop all charges against the Saudi rape victim known as the "Qatif Girl" and (2) abolish such law as well as other laws that compromise women's freedom, dignity, and equality.

Expresses sympathy for the "Qatif Girl."</summary>
