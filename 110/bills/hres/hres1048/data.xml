  <summary date="2008-05-09T13:20:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Calls for the release of Dr. Nguyen Quoc Quan and other political detainees by the government of Vietnam.

Condemns the ongoing human rights abuses in Vietnam.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) re-designate Vietnam as a Country of Particular Concern; (2) demand the government of Vietnam comply with internationally-recognized standards for basic freedoms and human rights; and (3) remove Vietnam's permanent normal trade relations status unless all political and religious prisoners are released and significant and immediate human rights reforms are made by the government of Vietnam.</summary>
