Declares that such action should: (1) enforce rules to eliminate unfair and deceptive practices in sub-prime mortgage lending; (2) encourage lenders to evaluate a borrower's ability to reasonably repay any mortgage loan; (3) establish clear minimum standards for mortgage originators; (4) require that disclosures clearly and effectively communicate necessary information about any mortgage loan to the potential borrower; (5) reduce or eliminate abuses in prepayment penalties; (6) address appraisal and other mortgage fraud; (7) raise public awareness regarding mortgage originators whose loans have high foreclosure rates; and (8) increase opportunities for loan counseling.</summary>
