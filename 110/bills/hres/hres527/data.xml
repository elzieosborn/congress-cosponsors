  <summary date="2007-07-18T19:50:02Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Supports helping vulnerable youth through current programs authorized under title IV (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) (TANF) of the Social Security Act.

Encourages the promotion through such programs of assistance for especially foster youth in staying off the streets, staying in school, and obtaining their high school diplomas and further education and training.

Applauds the initiative of public and private organizations and individuals dedicated to helping these programs prevent homelessness among youth, and provide aid when prevention fails.

Declares that the House of Representatives should recognize National Homeless Youth Awareness Month (November) to support and further encourage such efforts.</summary>
