The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nExpresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) as Congress considers the President's request for over $150 billion more for the war in Iraq it is essential that Congress and the people of the United States know the extent of corruption in the Iraqi government and whether corruption is fueling the insurgency; (2) it was wrong to retroactively classify portions of the report titled \"Stabilizing and Rebuilding Iraq: U.S. Ministry Capacity Development Efforts Need an Overall Integrated Strategy to Guide Efforts and Manage Risk\" which was released October 4, 2007, and other statements that do not meet the criteria for classification; (3) it is an abuse of the classification process to withhold from Congress and the people of the United States broad assessments of the extent of corruption in the Iraqi government; and (4) a directive that prohibits federal officials from providing Congress and the people of the United States with broad assessments which characterize the quality of Iraqi governance should be rescinded."
