  <summary date="2008-01-15T20:43:39Z" status="Passed House amended">Recognizes: (1) that the United States and Brazil have arrived at the point of a strategic confluence of interests and urges President George W. Bush to continue to deepen the bilateral relationship between the two countries; and (2) Brazil's role as a leader in the Western Hemisphere and commends its leadership of the United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) in Haiti.

Commends: (1) Brazil for successfully diversifying its energy resources and reducing its dependence on oil; and (2) joint efforts by the United States and Brazil to use expertise to provide technical assistance for biofuels industries in third countries, currently including the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, and St. Kitts and Nevis.

Expresses support for the March 9, 2007, United States-Brazil Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on biofuels as a major step forward in bilateral relations, hemispheric integration, and energy diversification.

 Encourages U.S. and Brazilian officials to quickly identify additional countries in the Western Hemisphere to receive technical assistance related to biofuels.</summary>
