  <summary date="2008-07-23T19:23:39Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to declare that during consideration in the Committee of the Whole of a bill making appropriations for the Department of the Treasury for any fiscal year, before consideration of any other amendment, it shall be in order to consider an amendment only proposing to bar the automatic annual cost-of-living pay adjustment of Members of Congress that would otherwise take effect in such fiscal year.

Declares that, during consideration of legislation between the two chambers making or continuing appropriations to the end of a fiscal year that includes appropriations for such Department for that fiscal year, it shall not be in order to consider such measure unless: (1) it includes a provision to bar such pay adjustment; or (2) the rule providing for its consideration allows a vote proposing such bar.</summary>
