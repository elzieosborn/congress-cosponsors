Lawson of Denver, Colorado, an African American woman who valiantly served her country in the Army Air Corps during World War II and serving as a hospital neuropsychiatric team member, was unfairly passed over for promotion and should have held the grade of technical sergeant, rather than private first class, upon her discharge from the service on January 2, 1946.</title>
