Expresses the sense of Congress that all Americans should work together to strengthen families and reduce the need of foster care placement for children.

Urges Congress to continue its commitment to providing critical assistance to children and families involved in the foster care system through part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act and other programs designed to help children reunite with their parents or find a loving and permanent home when they cannot return to their biological parents.</summary>
