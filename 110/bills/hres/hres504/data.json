Requires such classified information to be made available to Members in a timely manner as appropriate under existing laws and rules.\n\nExpresses the sense of the House that, with the objective of preventing circumvention of this resolution, that the Committee on Rules should develop standardized policies and procedures to require that proposed amendments (except those offered under an open rule) that are major in size, scope, or cost be posted on the Internet for an appropriate number of hours."
