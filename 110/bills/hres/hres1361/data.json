Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to urge the Human Rights Council to adhere to its mandate and asks him to refocus the 2009 Durban Review Conference efforts on the review of what U.N. member states have done to fulfill their commitments to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and on concrete action to fight racism, anti-Semitism, and all forms of hatred and violence.\n\nCalls on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to urge U.N. member states to adhere to the agreed framework of the 2009 Durban Review Conference."
