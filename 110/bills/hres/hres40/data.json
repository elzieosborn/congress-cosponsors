Requires rules governing floor debate to be reported before 10 p.m. for any legislation to be considered the following day.\n\nRequires floor votes to be completed within 15 minutes, with the customary two-minute extension to accommodate Members' ability to get to the House chamber to cast their votes. Prohibits votes from being held open in order to manipulate the outcome.\n\nRequires: (1) conference committees to hold regular meetings (at least weekly) of all conference committee Members; and (2) all managers appointed to such committee to be informed of its schedule of activities in a timely manner and given ample opportunity for input and debate as decisions are made toward final language for the conference report.\n\nRestricts the Suspension Calendar to non-controversial legislation. Makes the ratio of legislation sponsored by members of the minority party on such Calendar the same as their ratio to the membership of the whole House."
