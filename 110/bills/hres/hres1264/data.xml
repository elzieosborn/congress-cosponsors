  <summary date="2008-08-12T19:59:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that state and local governments: (1) should only execute the power of eminent domain for the public good; (2) must always justly compensate affected individuals in accordance with the Fifth Amendment; (3) should never use eminent domain to advantage one private party over another; and (4) should not construe Kelo v. City of New London (Kelo) as justification to abuse the power of eminent domain.

Reserves to Congress the right to address through legislation any abuses of eminent domain by state and local government in light of Kelo.</summary>
