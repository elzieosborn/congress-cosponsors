  <summary date="2007-06-25T21:04:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) of the Rules of the House of Representatives with respect to a point of order against consideration of legislation reported by a committee (or a related amendment) which does not list congressional earmarks or limited tax or tariff benefits (and the name of the requesting Member), or a statement that the proposition contains none.

Declares that, as disposition of such a point of order, the Chair shall put the question of consideration with respect to the measure, and it shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent. Declares further, however, that the question shall otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one that the House adjourn.</summary>
