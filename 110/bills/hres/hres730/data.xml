  <summary date="2007-12-20T22:44:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the planned acquisition of a minority interest in 3Com by affiliates of Huawei Technologies in China triggers a number of statutory national security factors to be considered by the President and members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to block a foreign acquisition; and (2) the preponderance of publicly available evidence suggests that such proposed acquisition threatens U.S. national security and should not be approved by CFIUS.</summary>
