  <summary date="2008-06-11T20:55:17Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Commends the millions of fathers who serve as wonderful, caring parents for their children.

Calls on fathers across the United States to use Father's Day to: (1) reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's lives; (2) spend Father's Day with their children; and (3) express their love and support for their children.

Urges men to understand the level of responsibility fathering a child requires, especially in the encouragement of children's moral, academic, and spiritual development.

Encourages active involvement of fathers in the rearing and development of their children, including the devotion of time, energy, and resources.</summary>
