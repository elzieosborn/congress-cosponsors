  <summary date="2008-10-29T19:39:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes that: (1) support for free speech is a hallmark of our nation's political discourse; and (2) achieving national security and international priorities will require restraint and wisdom on the part of our nation's leaders and diplomats, particularly the use of provocative language which may undermine legitimate diplomatic and national security efforts.

Expresses concern about the potential adverse effects of growing negative perceptions of the United States on efforts to address global threats facing our nation.

Calls on all parties, including the Administration and the international community, to engage in activities that are conducive to dialogue and diplomacy.</summary>
