  <summary date="2007-05-31T15:06:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) support a mutually-agreed solution for Kosovo's future status for both Serbia and Kosovo; (2) insist on fulfillment of all agreed-upon democratic standards set forth by the United Nations before supporting final status for Kosovo; (3) restrain from any unilateral action toward Kosovo's independence, especially actions outside the United Nations; (4) work together with the European Union (EU) in supporting the political and economic development of the province of Kosovo and Serbia; (5) support the full integration of the province of Kosovo and Serbia into international and Euro-Atlantic institutions; and (6) reaffirm its commitment to southeastern Europe.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the provincial government of Kosovo should ensure the full political and economic rights of Serbs and other minority communities in Kosovo; (2) the international community should recognize that additional negotiations and diplomacy does not represent a delay of the Kosovo process, and that the government of Serbia currently has legal sovereignty over Kosovo; and (3) the government of Serbia should continue toward a peaceful future through integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions and toward the establishment of constructive relations with the provincial government of Kosovo.</summary>
