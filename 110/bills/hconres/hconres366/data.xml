  <summary date="2008-07-15T16:40:08Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Declares that it is the sense of Congress that: (1) this nation should dedicate its resources to the development of a broad pool of citizens who are functionally literate in science, mathematics, and technology; (2) a national science education policy in the coming decade should address specified crucial need areas; and (3) this national challenge can be met through strong leadership from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, other federal, state, and local governments, and with long-term commitments from the civic, business, and engineering communities.</summary>
