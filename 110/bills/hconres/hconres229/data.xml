Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that the United States, through the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, should: (1) pursue a review and assessment of compliance with conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission for the 2006 Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery and other fisheries subject to Commission jurisdiction; (2) address noncompliance by nations through appropriate actions including, as appropriate, deducting a proportion of a future quota for a country to compensate for such country exceeding its quota in prior years; (3) pursue a meaningful discussion of the implementation and effectiveness of the Commission recommendation entitled "Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean"; and (4) seek to strengthen conservation and management of Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna by making recommendations to halt the decline of the stock and begin to rebuild it.</summary>
