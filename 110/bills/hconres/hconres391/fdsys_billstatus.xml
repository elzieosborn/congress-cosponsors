        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Declares that Congress recognizes that: (1) for most types of subprime mortgages, borrowers of color are more likely to receive higher rate loans; (2) there are many factors that have played roles in making these mortgages more costly to these borrowers; and (3) policymakers should review whether lower cost lenders need additional incentives to help meet the credit needs of communities of color.</p> <p>Encourages: (1) fair pricing of home mortgages based only on legitimate risk factors and facilitates economic progress for all borrowers; and (2) lenders to eliminate discretionary pricing in the subprime mortgage market, and to adopt transparent, market-driven prices for mortgages representing similar risks.</p> <p>Encourages more transparency by: (1) addressing yield-spread premiums in laws designed to protect homeowners from abusive lending practices; (2) prohibiting yield-spread premiums subprime and nontraditional home loans; (3) improving transparency of yield-spread premiums by requiring brokers to explain to applicants what the rate, payment, and fees on the loan could be with and without such premium; (4) following the trends of the securities industry, holding lenders and brokers responsible for providing loans that are suitable for a given borrower; and (5) prohibiting prepayment penalties in subprime loans.</p> <p>Encourages preventing pricing discrimination by requiring subprime lenders to disclose more detailed pricing and underwriting information in their Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data.</p> <p>Encourages: (1) regulators to report annually on the number of fair lending examinations performed and for each examination provide certain publicly available information; and (2) public and private partnerships to ensure that responsible investments are made in underserved communities.</p> <p>Upholds the laws and regulations that prohibit predatory, irresponsible subprime lending and have proven effective in reducing the number of abusive loans while maintaining a vibrant market for subprime home loans.</p> <p>Urges policymakers to: (1) endorse legislation that builds on the proven methods for protecting families from abusive lending while retaining access to subprime credit; and (2) oppose preemption of state and local laws designed to protect homeowners.</p>]]></text>
