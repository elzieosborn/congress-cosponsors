  <summary date="2007-12-10T22:17:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Declares that Congress strongly condemns the continued violations of human rights by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), including regarding birth limitations and related forced abortions and sterilization.

 Urges the PRC government to cease these policies and urges the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to cease all its activities in the PRC and withdraw from that country.

 Affirms certain internationally recognized human rights, including the right of women to bear children unconstrained by government policies limiting the number of children they bear and the right of children not to be discriminated against by a government because they were born contrary to a government plan.

Asks that the President and the Secretary of State raise these concerns with the PRC government, call upon the PRC government to cease immediately these policies, and continue to withhold funds from UNFPA due to UNFPA's continued involvement in supporting coercive abortion and sterilization, which violates the "Kemp-Kasten" provision of U.S. law.</summary>
