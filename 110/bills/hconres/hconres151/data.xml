  <summary date="2007-08-07T19:08:11Z" status="Passed House amended">Recalls the essential role that transparency and the free flow of information play in creating democratic institutions and civil society.

Recognizes the vital contribution made by independent journalists in Russia in bringing transparency and a free flow of information to readers after decades of Communist censorship and repression.

Notes the disturbing trend of murders of independent journalists in Russia over the last decade.

Encourages the President of the United States to offer Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials of the Russian government law enforcement investigative assistance to help identify and bring to justice those responsible for the many unsolved murders of journalists in Russia.

Urges President Putin to seek out competent, outside law enforcement assistance in the investigation of such murders.</summary>
