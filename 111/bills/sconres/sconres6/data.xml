  <summary date="2009-03-31T19:22:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Declares that Congress commits to passing, within 18 months, legislation that guarantees health care for women and all individuals and that establishes coverage that enables women to attain good health that they can maintain during their reproductive years and throughout their lives.

Requires such legislation to : (1) recognize the role of women as health care consumers, caregivers, and providers; (2) guarantee a level of benefits and care necessary to achieve and maintain good health throughout a woman's lifetime and lessen the burdens caused by poor health; (3) promote primary and preventive care; (4) provide a choice of public and private insurance plans and direct access to a choice of health care providers to ensure continuity of coverage and a delivery system that meets the needs of women; (5) eliminate disparities in health coverage, treatment, and outcomes on the basis of gender, culture, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health status, or sexual orientation; (6) share financing responsibility among employers, individuals, and the government while taking into account small business needs; (7) ensure affordable access to health care; (8) enhance health care quality and patient safety; (9) ensure a sufficient supply of qualified providers through expanded medical and public health education and adequate reimbursement; (10) ensure every woman access to a women's medical home, including direct access to women's health care providers and care coordination, throughout each woman's lifetime; (11) recognize and promote the role of women as providers of health care; and (12) promote administrative efficiency and ease of use.

Urges the President sign such legislation.</summary>
