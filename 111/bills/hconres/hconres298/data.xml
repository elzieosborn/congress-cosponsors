  <summary date="2010-07-21T14:50:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) citizen recording fills in gaps in existing checks against law enforcement abuses, when balanced with the needs of law enforcement, police privacy, and citizen privacy; (2) national security alone is insufficient justification for harassment, charges, or an arrest for otherwise innocent behavior, such as videotaping; and (3) members of the public have a right to observe, and if they choose, to make video or sound recordings of the police during the discharge of their public duties, as long as they do not physically or otherwise interfere with the officers' discharge of their duties, or violate any other state or federal law, intended to protect the safety of police officers, in the process of the recording.</summary>
