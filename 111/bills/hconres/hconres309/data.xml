  <summary date="2010-09-15T15:34:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) BP should fund a $500 million dollar recovery fund focusing exclusively on travel and tourism; (2) the fund should be administered by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility through a transparent process with defined criteria for award; and (3) county or parish and state tourism boards and visitors bureaus in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida should all be eligible for funding based upon a demonstrated decline in travelers since the beginning of the BP oil spill.</summary>
