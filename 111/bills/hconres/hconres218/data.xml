  <summary date="2010-01-11T16:55:35Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Regrets the killing of unarmed civilians and expresses deepest condolences to the families of the 57 victims who were slain in Maguindanao in the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history.

Calls for: (1) an independent investigation and prosecution of those responsible; (2) an end to extrajudicial killings and election-related violence; and (3) freedom of press and safety for the investigating reporters.

Urges the Department of State, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other U.S. government agencies to review their assistance programs to the government of the Philippines and to offer any technical assistance that Philippine authorities may request.

Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to work with Philippine authorities to combat corruption, terrorism, and security threats.</summary>
