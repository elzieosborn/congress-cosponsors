  <summary date="2009-10-21T21:19:52Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that Congress should: (1) enact into law a meaningful national standard to protect commercial and government data, including a robust definition of encryption tied to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); and (2) adopt legislation that requires that sensitive data be protected through meaningful encryption technology and require government subcontractors having access to sensitive and personally identifiable information to comply with the same standards as federal agencies and departments; and (3) encourage leaders of government agencies and private enterprises to actively manage and rigorously protect the data collected and stored within their institution by making data security a priority within the institution.</summary>
