Recognizes the significance of the 100th anniversary of the "Weeks Law" (the Act of March 1, 1911) to the history of conservation.

Encourages efforts to celebrate the centennial in the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire and Maine, with a focus on the future as well as in commemoration of the past.

Encourages continued collaboration and cooperation among federal, state, and local governments, as well as business, tourism, and conservation interests, to ensure that the many values and benefits that flow from the White Mountain National Forest today to the citizens of New Hampshire and the rest of the United States are recognized and supported in perpetuity.</summary>
