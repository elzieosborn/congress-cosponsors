  <summary date="2009-03-13T15:50:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Declares that: (1) time on a budget resolution may only be yielded back by consent; (2) no first degree amendment may be proposed after the 10th hour of debate on such legislation unless it has been submitted to the Journal Clerk before the expiration of such hour; (3) no second degree amendment may be proposed after the 20th hour of debate on a budget resolution unless it has been submitted to such Clerk before the expiration of the 20th hour; (4) the budget resolution shall be set aside for one calendar day, after up to 40 hours of debate, so that all filed amendments are printed and made available in the Congressional Record before debate continues; and (5) provisions contained in such measure or its amendments shall exclude programmatic detail not within the Senate Committee on the Budget's jurisdiction.

Permits waiver or suspension of such requirements, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate.</summary>
