Commends U.S. Jesuit colleges and universities for their solidarity with the UCA and annual remembrances of the Jesuit martyrs.

Acknowledges the role played by the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador, Representative John Joseph Moakley, the Jesuit leadership of the UCA, and the Salvadoran judicial investigation and convictions in advancing negotiations to end the war, such that the deaths of the Jesuit martyrs and laywomen contributed directly to achieving the peace to which they had dedicated their lives.
