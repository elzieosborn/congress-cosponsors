  <summary date="2011-02-02T12:59:22Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Supports the development of a democratic political system and free market economy in Moldova and a November 2010 parliamentary election process that comports with international standards.

 Recognizes that the government of Moldova's commitment to economic and political reforms since 2009 has resulted in progress towards integration into European institutions.

 Acknowledges that continued reform and commitment to a free election process will remain necessary for Moldova's full integration into the Western community of nations.

 Notes that continued reforms in Moldova could provide for an additional basis for the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions.

 Encourages ongoing negotiations between the European Union (EU) and the Republic of Moldova concerning visa liberalization and an Association Agreement.</summary>
