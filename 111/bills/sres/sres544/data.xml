  <summary date="2010-06-30T15:09:00Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) sanitary measures affecting trade in beef and beef products between the United States and China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam should be based on science; (2) since banning U.S. beef in December 2003, such countries have failed to comply with internationally-recognized World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) scientific guidelines with respect to U.S. beef and beef products; (3) these countries should fully comply with such guidelines, and open their markets to U.S. beef product exporters; and (4) the President should continue to insist on full access for U.S. beef product exporters to the markets of such countries.</summary>
