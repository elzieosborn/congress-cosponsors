Designates June 2009 as National Aphasia Awareness Month.

Expresses support for efforts to: (1) increase awareness of aphasia (a communication impairment caused by brain damage that typically results from a stroke); and (2) make the voices of people with aphasia heard.

Recognizes that strokes are the third-largest cause of death and disability in the United States.

Acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and study in order to find new solutions.</summary>
