  <summary date="2009-12-09T22:17:59Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States Trade Representative (USTR) should establish a strategy for initiating negotiations for a free trade agreement between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); and (2) any pending bilateral issues between the United States and Burma should not deter the United States from negotiating free trade agreements with other ASEAN nations, nor should the United States encourage trade with Burma, absent significant reforms within that country.</summary>
