Congratulates the people of China for hosting Expo 2010.

 Expresses the sense of the Senate that Expo 2010 constitutes an important step along the path of reform and opening up in China.

 Calls on the sponsors and operators of the USA Pavilion to make maximum use of this opportunity to showcase the very best attributes that the United States has to offer and to strengthen the cultural, scientific, educational, people-to-people, trade, and investment links between the people of the United States and the people of China.

Acknowledges the more than 60 private-sector and other sponsor partners of the USA Pavilion for their contributions to the project and for providing a positive example of public-private partnerships.</summary>
