  <summary date="2009-05-27T21:54:12Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Recognizes that June 6, 2009, marks the 70th anniversary of the date when the MS St. Louis returned to Europe after its passengers were refused admittance to the United States and other Western Hemisphere countries.

 Honors the memory of the 937 refugees aboard the M.S. St. Louis, most of whom were Jews fleeing Nazi oppression, and 254 of whom subsequently died during the Holocaust.

 Recognizes such anniversary as an opportunity to raise awareness about an important historical event whose lessons are relevant to current and future generations.</summary>
