  <summary date="2010-07-13T21:44:19Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Requires the Secretary of the Senate to make the Senate amendment database (ats.senate.gov or a similar amendment database) available on a public website in a manner that will allow the public to view amendments as soon as they are made widely available to Members of Congress and staff.

Requires the Secretary to improve the Senate amendment website and any other amendment website made available to the public by ensuring that: (1) all amendments are scanned and posted on the website in their entirety; (2) all submitted amendments have their purpose inputted when they are entered into the website; (3) all amendments are identified on the website as first degree or second degree and by what bill or amendment they are offered, if available; (4) all amendments on the website have the dates they were submitted, proposed, and disposed of; and (5) all amendments and any associated metadata are permanently available on the website or the Legislative Information System (LIS)/THOMAS sites.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that appropriations should be made available through the appropriations process to carry out this resolution.</summary>
