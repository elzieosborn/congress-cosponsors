  <summary date="2010-10-21T16:33:19Z" status="Passed Senate amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on September 24, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Acknowledges the urgency of addressing the threats to U.S. national security in Somalia and the conditions that foster those threats.

Reaffirms the Senate's commitment to stand with the people of Somalia who aspire to a future free of terrorism and violence through political reconciliation.

Recognizes the important work being done by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).

Calls on: (1) the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia to cease any use of child soldiers and renew its commitment to political reconciliation; and (2) regional governments and parties, particularly the government of Eritrea, to play a productive role in helping to bring peace to Somalia.

Welcomes the President's efforts to bring greater focus and resources toward the situation in Somalia.

Urges the President to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure that all U.S. humanitarian, diplomatic, political, and counterterrorism programs in Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa are coordinated toward the long-term goal of establishing stability, respect for human rights, and functional, inclusive governance in Somalia.</summary>
