Supports the designation of Poverty in America Awareness Month.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) eradicating poverty in the United States should be the goal for all people in the United States; (2) the severe economic downturn has highlighted the need to ensure that the nation's most vulnerable individuals and families are able to meet their most fundamental needs during a time of financial crisis; and (3) Congress should recommit itself to helping individuals and families facing economic hardship receive the assistance they need and deserve in moving towards greater economic security through programs under title IV (Grants to States for Aid and Services to Needy Families with Children and for Child-welfare Services) of the Social Security Act and other related programs.</summary>
