 Opposes their prosecution when rooted in an excess of political correctness and over-sensitivity.

 Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that any member of the Armed Forces accused of a crime related to the treatment of a suspected terrorist should have any legal fees related to their defense paid for by the U.S. government, if the member is acquitted or the charges are dropped.</summary>
