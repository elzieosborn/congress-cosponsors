Supports the designation of National Physical Education and Sport Week. Recognizes the central role of physical education and sports in creating healthy lifestyles for all children and youth.

Encourages: (1) school districts to implement local wellness policies, as described in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004, that include ambitious goals for physical education, physical activity, and other activities addressing the childhood obesity epidemic and promoting child wellness; and (2) schools to offer physical education classes to students and work with community partners to provide opportunities and safe spaces for physical activities before and after school and during the summer months for all children and youth.</summary>
