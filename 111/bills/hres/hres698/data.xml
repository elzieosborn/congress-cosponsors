  <summary date="2009-09-10T15:59:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the fatal crash of an MV-22 aircraft on April 8, 2000, in Marana, Arizona, was not the result of pilot error that can be attributed to the late Lieutenant Colonel John A. Brow or the late Major Brooks S. Gruber; (2) the fatal factor in such crash was the aircraft's lack of a Vortex Ring State (VRS) warning system; and (3) had adequate High Rate of Descent (HROD) and Vortex Ring State (VRS) developmental testing been conducted before the Operational Evaluation of April 8, 2000, and a VRS warning system had been installed, such pilots would have been able to avoid or recover from VRS.</summary>
