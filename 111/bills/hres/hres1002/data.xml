Encourages all individuals in the United States to pay tribute to the life and works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. through participation in community service projects on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

 Recognizes: (1) the value of community service and volunteerism in the creation of civil society and as a means of nonviolent community progress consistent with Dr. King's works; and (2) the benefits of the collaborative work by the many organizations that promote, facilitate, and carry out service projects.

Encourages the Members of the House of Representatives and colleagues to urge their constituents to participate in community service projects.

Acknowledges that by serving one's country, one's community, and one's neighbor our nation makes progress in civility, equality, and unity consistent with the values and life's work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</summary>
