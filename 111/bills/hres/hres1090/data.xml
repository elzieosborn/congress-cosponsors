  <summary date="2010-04-13T17:45:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes the hearing of the Senate Committee on Armed Services on the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy (concerning sexual orientation in the military), and the testimony of Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael G. Mullen, as an important first step in bringing about the repeal of such policy and in permitting gay and lesbian Americans to serve openly in the Armed Forces.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the policy, as codified under federal law, should be repealed in 2010 and that repeal legislation should be promptly brought to a vote.

Expresses the hope that President Obama will continue his leadership on this issue.

Urges the Pentagon working group to deliver a repeal implementation plan to Congress as soon as possible while ensuring that the needs and concerns of members of the Armed Forces (members) are taken into consideration.

Pledges that the House will do its part to move the repeal planning and implementation process forward in a timeline that is best for all members.

Recommends that the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Subcommittee on Personnel Management of the House Armed Services Committee include members, regardless of their sexual orientation, in the upcoming hearings regarding the policy.</summary>
