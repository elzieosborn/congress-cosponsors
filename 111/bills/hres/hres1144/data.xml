Recognizes that Chile is a close ally and friend of the United States, and that its embrace of democratic ideals and the Chilean government's ability to implement strict building standards greatly mitigated the impact of this disaster.

Commends the rescue, relief, and recovery actions, still underway, taken by the government of Chile.

Commends the U.S. government, the entire international community, and nongovernmental organizations for their prompt deployment of assistance to Chile.
