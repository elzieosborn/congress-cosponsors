  <summary date="2010-11-17T22:55:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Encourages individuals to be proactive about their health and to become knowledgeable of their blood pressure and their risk for hypertension.

Expresses support for: (1) community-based programs that use culturally competent and evidence-based strategies to address hypertension; and (2) research that provides a better understanding of how hypertension affects communities that have been historically underrepresented in demographic studies and clinical trials for antihypertensive drugs.

Recognizes the importance of linking hypertension awareness programs to other existing programs that address health concerns such as diabetes and obesity at the community health and development levels.

Calls for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to set mandatory national standards, including improved nutrition labeling, for the sodium content in foods.</summary>
