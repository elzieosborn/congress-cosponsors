  <summary date="2010-03-24T21:26:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Makes it out of order in the House to consider legislation reported or not reported by any committee, or any amendment or conference report, that includes a congressional earmark or limited tax or tariff benefit.

 Applies such prohibition only to legislation providing or authorizing discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority, providing a federal tax deduction, credit, or exclusion, or modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in FY2011.

 Excludes from such prohibition any authorization of appropriations to a federal entity which is not specifically targeted to a state, locality, or congressional district.

 Prohibits the House Committee on Rules from reporting a rule or order that would waive such point of order.</summary>
