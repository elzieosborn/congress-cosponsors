  <summary date="2010-04-02T15:17:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) strongly believes that the decision to abandon the 23-year bipartisan project establishing Yucca Mountain (Nevada) as the nation's primary permanent nuclear waste storage site breaks a promise made to certain states and violates the letter of the law by extending the length of time states will be forced to store nuclear waste; and (2) calls upon the President to honor the bipartisan commitment made to taxpayers to establish Yucca Mountain as the nation's primary permanent nuclear waste storage site.</summary>
