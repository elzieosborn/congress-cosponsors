Makes it out of order to consider legislation that contains a congressional earmark for any entity named after an incumbent Member of Congress.

Amends Rule XXIII (Code of Official Conduct) to require any Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner requesting a congressional earmark in any legislation (or accompanying report) to: (1) submit certain information to the Clerk of the House for posting within 24 hours on the Clerk's website, including the amount requested, the project name, and a project description of the subject of the earmark; (2) include, in the case of an earmark for a non-federal entity, an accompanying letter of support from that entity certifying that it will provide matching funds equal to at least 10% of the earmark; and (3) provide a written statement to the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction certifying that no family member of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner has any financial interest in the earmark.

Amends Rule II (Other Officers and Officials) to require the Clerk to post on the Clerk's website, under the heading "Member Spending Requests," an up-to-date list of all such information.</summary>
