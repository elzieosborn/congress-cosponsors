  <summary date="2010-04-07T15:34:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Supports President Obama's agenda to strengthen U.S. trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea, Panama, and Colombia.

Declares that the House of Representatives remains concerned that the United States risks losing markets in Colombia, Panama, and South Korea to its competitors due to its inaction as these and other countries move forward with their respective free trade agreements.

Calls on President Obama to: (1) submit to Congress the trade agreements the United States has signed with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea; and (2) work to ensure their passage as soon as possible.</summary>
