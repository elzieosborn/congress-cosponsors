Impeaches G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, for high crimes and misdemeanors.

Sets forth articles of impeachment.

Declares that, while a U.S. district court judge, G. Thomas Porteous, engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a judge.

Declares that Judge Porteous denied a motion to recuse himself from a case where one of the parties was represented by a corrupt law firm with which he had a financial relationship.

Declares that Judge Porteous made intentionally misleading statements at the recusal hearing and engaged in corrupt conduct after the trial, and while he had the case under advisement.

Declares that Judge Porteous: (1) engaged in a longstanding pattern of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge; and (2) engaged in a pattern of conduct inconsistent with the trust and confidence placed in him as a federal judge by knowingly and intentionally making material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury related to his personal bankruptcy filing, and by repeatedly violating a court order in his bankruptcy case.

Declares that Judge Porteous knowingly made material false statements about his past to both the U.S. Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in order to obtain the office of U.S. District Court Judge.

Declares that Judge Porteous is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.</summary>
