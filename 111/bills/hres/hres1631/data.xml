  <summary date="2010-10-06T12:56:40Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses the appreciation of the House of Representatives for the efforts of those countries that have restored religious property wrongly confiscated during the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.

Welcomes the initiatives and commitment of the Republic of Cyprus to work to restore and maintain religious heritage sites.

Urges the government of Turkey to: (1) implement immediately the United Nations Security Council Resolutions relevant to Cyprus as well as the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights; (2) work to retrieve and restore all lost artifacts and immediately halt destruction on religious sites, illegal archaeological excavations, and traffic in icons and antiquities; and (3) allow for the proper preservation and reconstruction of destroyed or altered religious sites and immediately cease all restrictions on freedom of religion for the enclaved Cypriots.

Calls on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, the President, the Secretary of State, and the State Department Office of International Religious Freedom to take specified steps to address the concerns and actions called for in this resolution.

Urges the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to: (1) ensure that member states do not receive stolen Cypriot art and antiquities; and (2) press the government of Turkey to abide by its international commitments in this matter.</summary>
