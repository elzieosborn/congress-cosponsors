  <summary date="2010-06-03T12:47:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Observes the 15th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide.

Supports the designation of Srebrenica Remembrance Day in the United States.

Commends the official bodies that have recognized the Srebrenica genocide, including the European Parliament which declared a Srebrenica Remembrance Day in the European Union (EU).

Honors the memory of the thousands of innocent people who died at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995, along with all individuals who were killed during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Extends condolences to the families and friends of those who died at Srebrenica and during the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Reaffirms support for: (1) the independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina; (2) peace in southeastern Europe; and (3) the right of all people living in the region to return to their homes and enjoy the benefits of democratic institutions.

Thanks the International Commission on Missing Persons for outstanding achievement in identifying persons missing from Srebrenica and from the conflict in the western Balkans in the 1990s.

Expresses satisfaction at the apprehension and transfer of Radovan Karadzic to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and urges all countries to cooperate fully with the ICTY and apprehend all persons indicted by the ICTY, including Ratko Mladic.</summary>
