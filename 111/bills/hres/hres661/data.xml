Instructs the managers on the part of the House of Representatives in the impeachment proceedings against Samuel B. Kent, formally judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, to appear before and advise the Senate that, because Samuel B. Kent is no longer a civil officer of the United States, the House of Representatives does not desire further to urge the articles of impeachment hitherto filed in the Senate against him.</summary>
