  <summary date="2010-12-06T21:56:58Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Commends the Marshall Center for its efforts to promote peace and security throughout North America, Europe, and Eurasia.

Expresses appreciation: (1) for the partnership between the United States and German governments in advancing mutual national security interests through the Center's programs; and (2) to Marshall Center Director Dr. John P. Rose and his outstanding faculty and staff.

 Notes that U.S. security remains inseparably linked to peace and stability on the European continent.

Reaffirms the commitment of the House of Representatives to promoting transatlantic cooperation through international collaborative educational programs such as those offered by the Marshall Center.</summary>
