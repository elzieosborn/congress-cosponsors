  <summary date="2009-12-16T22:58:14Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Supports the designation of the week of December 7 as National Computer Science Education Week.

Encourages: (1) identification by schools, teachers, researchers, universities, and policymakers of mechanisms for teachers to receive cutting edge professional development so that they can provide sustainable learning experiences in computer science; (2) exposure of students to computer science concepts; and (3) opportunities for females and underrepresented minorities in computer science.

Supports research in computer science to address what would motivate increased participation in such field.</summary>
