  <summary date="2010-08-05T13:18:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Condemns: (1) the violence and harassment faced by the villagers of Con Dau, Da Nang, Vietnam, for seeking to protect their land, the historic cemetery, and other parish properties; and (2) the arrests of parishioners and calls for the release of Nguyen Huu Liem, Phan Thi Nhan, Nguyen Thi The, Doan Cang, Le Thanh Lam, Tran Thanh Viet, Nguyen Thi Lieu, and Nguyen Huu Minh.

Urges the government of Vietnam to consider the implications of its actions in Con Dau, as well as of other serious human rights violations, issues of police impunity, and corruption for the broader U.S.-Vietnam relationship.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the President should call on the United Nations Human Rights Council to appoint a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Vietnam to investigate human rights violations in that country; (2) the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam should visit those detained, including, Nguyen Huu Liem, Phan Thi Nhan, Nguyen Thi The, Doan Cang, Le Thanh Lam, Tran Thanh Viet, Nguyen Thi Lieu, and Nguyen Huu Minh, as well as the family of Nguyen Nam, and other parishioners, and report its findings to Congress; (3) the Department of State should examine instances of property disputes in Vietnam which involve religious communities; and (4) the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom should visit the Con Dau parishioners and report to Congress on the violence and harassment faced by the Catholic villagers.</summary>
