  <summary date="2009-05-02T16:10:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the House of Representatives' commitment to: (1) integrating long-term care, particularly as it relates to home care and community services, into a comprehensive health care reform agenda; and (2) aiding relevant parties in composing, executing, and enforcing a well-informed national strategy for long-term care that will address geographic and economic disparities that limit access to care, expand long-term health services, and streamline quality measures.

 Recognizes that: (1) preventative health and the management of chronic disease are essential components in decreasing the future dependence on long-term care; and (2) Medicaid and out-of-pocket financing of long-term care excludes countless persons from receiving health care service, which can lead to more costly and invasive medical interventions, and alternative payment options should be widely available and more accessible.

Recognizes the need to: (1) collaborate with local, state, and federal health care entities to improve working conditions and training for home health aides; and (2) adequately fund and support existing technologies, entities, and initiatives that assist informal caregivers and help maintain and improve long-term health services for the disabled and elderly.</summary>
