  <summary date="2009-03-20T15:40:26Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) National Stalking Awareness Month provides an opportunity to educate Americans about stalking; (2) all Americans should applaud efforts to promote awareness about stalking; and (3) policymakers, criminal justice officials, victim service and human service agencies, college campuses and universities, nonprofits, and others should recognize the need to increase awareness of stalking and the availability of services for stalking victims.

Urges national and community organizations, private businesses, and the media to promote, through National Stalking Awareness Month, awareness of the crime of stalking.</summary>
