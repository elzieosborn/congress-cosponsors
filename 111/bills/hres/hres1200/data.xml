Encourages: (1) medical professionals and medical facilities in the United States to keep MH training current in order to rapidly recognize and diagnose the disorder and to maintain an appropriate supply of the drugs and equipment needed to successfully treat a MH emergency; and (2) families in the United States to document their health history.</summary>
