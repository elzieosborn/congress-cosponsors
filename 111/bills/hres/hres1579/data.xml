 Applies such prohibition only to legislation providing or authorizing discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority, or providing a federal tax deduction, credit, or exclusion in FY2011.

 Excludes from such prohibition any authorization of appropriations to a federal entity which is not specifically targeted to a state, locality, or congressional district.

 Prohibits the House Committee on Rules from reporting a rule or order that would waive such point of order.</summary>
