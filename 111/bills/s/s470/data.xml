  <summary date="2009-04-15T19:55:56Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Combating Organized Retail Crime Act of 2009- Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) expand the definitions of the crimes of transporting and selling or receiving stolen goods to include thefts having an aggregate value of $5,000 or more during any 12-month period; (2) modify the crime of fraud involving access devices to include the Universal Product Code label or similar product code label as an access device; and (3) set forth provisions to prevent sales of illegally obtained goods in a physical (e.g., flea market, open air market) or online retail marketplace and to grant enforcement powers to states to obtain injunctive and other relief against persons engaged in organized retail crime.

Requires the Attorney General to establish a suspected illegal sales activity form and a suspicious activity report form for the reporting of suspected sales of illegally-obtained items in a physical or online retail marketplace.

Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and, if appropriate, amend federal sentencing guidelines for persons convicted of offenses involving organized retail crime.</summary>
