  <summary date="2010-08-11T15:26:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Rural Community Flood Protection Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of the Army, upon receipt of a request from a non-federal interest, to conduct a levee system evaluation and certification of a federally authorized levee or a non-federally authorized levee for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program.

Limits the non-federal share of the cost of carrying out a levee system evaluation and certification to 35% of the total cost, but requires the Secretary to adjust the non-federal share to zero if: (1) the non-federal interest is located in an area with a population of 10,000 or fewer individuals; or (2) the division of the non-federal interest with responsibility for the applicable levee is staffed by individuals operating on a volunteer basis.</summary>
