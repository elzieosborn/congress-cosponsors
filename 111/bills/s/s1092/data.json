Limits the amount of a loan provided by a state to $5 million and the term of a loan to four years.\n\nAuthorizes states that receive allocations to: (1) impose on loan recipients a fee to cover the costs incurred by the state in administering the loan; and (2) retain the return of principal from loans for the purpose of making additional loans."
