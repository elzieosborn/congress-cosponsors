Prohibits such assistance from being used for on-farm improvements. Requires the Secretary, in providing assistance, to coordinate the activity with any work being conducted under the irrigation operations and maintenance program of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).\n\nCaps the federal share of the total cost at 75%, subject to a waiver or limitation on the nonfederal share, at the Tribe's request."
