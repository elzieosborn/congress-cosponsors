Requires annual defense budget documents to specify separate amounts for training and equipment and military construction for the National Guard for military assistance to civil authorities and other domestic operations.\n\n Reestablishes the position of Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau.\n\nDirects the Secretary to assure that tactical control of the Armed Forces on duty within a state or possession is vested in the governor thereof when such forces are engaged in a domestic operation, including emergency response.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) for FY2010 for National Guard: (1) continuity of operations, continuity of government, and consequence management in connection with response to terrorist and other attacks and catastrophes; (2) emergency preparedness and response activities; and (3) staffing of joint operations coordination centers in response to terrorist and other attacks and catastrophes.\n\nStates that the United States Northern Command and the United States Pacific Command shall be the combatant commands principally responsible for the military support of civil authorities in the United States. Requires the Commander of each Command and the Chief to enter into a memorandum of understanding setting forth the operational relationships, and individual roles and responsibilities, during responses to domestic emergencies among such Commands and the National Guard Bureau.\n\nRequires the officers serving as Commander of Army North Command and Commander of Air Force North Command to be officers in the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, respectively. Expresses the sense of Congress that, in assigning officers to such positions, the President should afford a preference to officers who have served as a state adjutant general."
