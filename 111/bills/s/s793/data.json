Sets maximum assistance amounts of $15,000 per academic year and $45,000 total. Requires prorated repayment for failure to satisfy education or service requirements, while allowing the Secretary to waive or suspend such repayment whenever noncompliance is due to circumstances beyond the control of the participant, or when waiver or suspension is in the best interests of the United States."
