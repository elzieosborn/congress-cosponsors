  <summary date="2009-12-11T21:23:12Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish a permanent estate tax exclusion of $3.5 million ($7 million for married couples filing joint tax returns) and a maximum 45% tax rate for decedents dying, generation-skipping transfers, and gifts made, after December 31, 2009; (2) allow an annual inflation adjustment to the exclusion amount after 2010; and (3) allow a surviving spouse an increase in the estate tax exclusion by the unused exclusion amount of a deceased spouse.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that any reduction in federal revenues resulting from this Act should be fully offset.</summary>
