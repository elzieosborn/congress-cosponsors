Limits the total amount of such fees to be paid to 2% of the amounts distributed to the Tribes, allottees, and the non-Indian landowners.\n\n(Sec. 12) Authorizes appropriations, of which, after the payment of attorneys fees: (1) 28% is for deposit into the tribal trust fund account; (2) 25% is for deposit into the allottee trust account; and (3) 47% is to be provided to Blackfoot River Flood Control District No. 7 for distribution to non-Indian landowners and for associated administrative expenses.\n\nProhibits funds received by the Tribes under this Act from being distributed to tribal members on a per capita basis."
