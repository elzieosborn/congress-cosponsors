(2) the integration of those engines into light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty natural gas vehicles for onroad and offroad applications; (3) the expansion of product availability by assisting manufacturers with the certification of such engines or vehicles to comply with federal or California certification requirements and in-use emission standards; (4) the demonstration and proper operation and use of such vehicles under all operating conditions; (5) the development and improvement of nationally recognized codes and standards for the continued safe operation of such vehicles and the components of the vehicles; (6) the improvement in the reliability and efficiency of natural gas fueling station infrastructure; (7) the certification of natural gas fueling station infrastructure to nationally recognized and industry safety standards; (8) the improvement in the reliability and efficiency of onboard natural gas fuel storage systems; (9) the development of new natural gas fuel storage materials; (10) the certification of onboard natural gas fuel storage systems to nationally recognized and industry safety standards; and (11) the use of natural gas engines in hybrid vehicles.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on such program within two years. Authorizes appropriations.</p> <p>(Sec. 402) Requires the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to study and report to Congress on the means by which the federal fleet could increase the number of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas vehicles in the fleet.<br> </p> <p><b>Title V: Authorization of Appropriations - </b>(Sec. 501) Authorizes such sums as are necessary to carry out this Act.</p> <p>(Sec. 502) Subjects the activities carried out under this Act to the cost-sharing requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.</p>]]></text>
