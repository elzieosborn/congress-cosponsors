Bars entities that receive a grant under this Act from being eligible for a loan guarantee during the period of their grant.\n\nSets forth provisions concerning: (1) loan guarantee terms and conditions; and (2) a borrower's default.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to review the subsidy estimates for the loan guarantees and to report to Congress.\n\nProhibits guaranteeing a loan after September 30, 2015.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for guaranteeing loans and for administrative expenses.\n\nDirects the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) under which the Board shall evaluate activities under this Act, recommend best practices for the development of science parks, and report on such evaluation and recommendations.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit specified tri-annual reports to Congress."
