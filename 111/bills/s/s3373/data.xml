Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zone Designation Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate areas nominated by local air pollution control districts as air and health quality empowerment zones, which shall be eligible for grants for replacing or retrofitting polluting vehicles and/or engines in order to improve the health of the population living in the zones.

Sets forth as area eligibility requirements: (1) being in extreme nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard and in nonattainment of the national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter that does not exceed 2.5 micrometers) promulgated by the Administrator under the Clean Air Act; (2) having specified emission levels of oxides of nitrogen from farm equipment, or of volatile organic compounds from farming operations, in 2010; (3) meeting or exceeding the national average per capita incidence of asthma; (4) having unemployment rates higher than the national average; and (5) being located in a state and local area that will match at least half of the federal funds provided. Prohibits an area from being designated unless the relevant district provides satisfactory assurances that the strategic plan required to be contained in its application will be implemented.

Requires a designation to remain in effect for ten years or until the Administrator revokes it. Authorizes the Administrator to revoke a designation if the relevant district: (1) has been designated as being in attainment with the national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 and ozone promulgated under the Clean Air Act; or (2) is failing to comply with, or make progress in achieving the goals of, its strategic plan.</summary>
