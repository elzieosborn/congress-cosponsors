(Current law contains the same prohibition, but without referring to serving under the authority of such license, certificate, or document.)\n\nRemoves a provision prohibiting an individual engaged on a towing vessel that pushes, pulls, or hauls alongside a tank vessel from entering a secured area without having (or without being accompanied by an individual who has) such a card."
