Allows the President to disapprove or change the guidelines and standards. Allows the Office and the head of an agency to use more stringent standards.\n\nRequires each agency to coordinate with the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Allows US-CERT's director, notwithstanding any law or policy, to direct the sponsorship of the security clearances for federal officers and employees whose responsibilities involve critical national security infrastructure.\n\nRequires the components of each executive branch department or agency (except the Department of Defense or any such component performing any national security function) to establish an automated reporting mechanism allowing its chief information security officer and security operations center at the agency level to implement and monitor the component's security policies, procedures, and controls."
