    "text": "Motor Carrier Protection Act of 2010 - Requires each freight forwarder or freight broker registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to: (1) pay an annual registration renewal fee in an amount determined by the Secretary of Transportation (DOT); (2) provide updated registration information; and (3) submit proof of compliance with applicable surety and insurance requirements.\n\nRequires noncompliant brokers, freight forwarders, or motor carriers to be listed as inactive on all relevant DOT websites.\n\nRequires the FMCSA Administrator to issue a distinctive registration number for each activity or service of a person (including motor carrier, freight forwarder, or broker) registered to provide one or more such activities or services. Requires a registrant to specify, in writing, the authority under which it is providing required services for each shipment for which it seeks compensation.\n\nRevises federal motor carrier registration requirements to prohibit a motor carrier from brokering transportation services unless registered as a broker. Requires registered motor carriers to maintain insurance for property damage when transporting property.\n\nRevises and consolidates federal registration and security requirements for freight forwarders and brokers. Prohibits a person from acting as a freight forwarder or broker unless that person: (1) holds a freight forwarder's permit or broker's license issued by the FMCSA; and (2) furnishes a bond or other surety from a provider determined by the FMCSA Administrator to be adequate to insure financial responsibility of at least $100,000.\n\nProhibits a person acting as a broker (other than a non-vessel-operating common carrier), or an ocean freight forwarder providing brokerage as part of an international through movement involving ocean transportation between the United States and a foreign port, from providing interstate brokerage services unless that person: (1) is registered under and in compliance with this Act; and (2) has satisfied financial security requirements. Prescribes civil penalties for violators of such requirements."
