        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine the number of full-time employees in each executive agency with the cooperation of each agency head. Excludes the Department of Defense (DOD) from the definition of &quot;agency&quot; for purpose of this Act.</p> <p>Requires each agency head to take such actions as necessary to reduce the number of full-time employees as determined by OMB by 20% within one year of this Act's enactment. Provides for two 180-day extensions if an agency submits a justification and a plan for completing the reductions. </p> <p>Requires each agency head, in making such reductions, to: (1) minimize the duplication of functions by employees within the agency; (2) restructure employee responsibilities to carry out all essential agency tasks; and (3) report to Congress on actions taken, the restructuring, and resulting savings to the government.</p> <p>Prohibits any adjustment in rates of basic pay or in comparability payments with respect to any employee during FY2011-FY2013. Limits bonuses and cash awards paid by an agency during each such fiscal year to the amount paid during FY2010.</p> <p>Limits the total amount of funds appropriated for FY2011: (1) to the White House and Congress to 85% of the total amount of funds appropriated to them during FY2010; and (2) for acquisition and maintenance of all motor vehicles owned or operated by all agencies to 80% of the total appropriated for that purpose during FY2010.</p>]]></text>
