        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Fairness for Homeowners Act of 2009 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit a creditor or mortgage broker from arranging a consumer credit transaction secured by the principal dwelling of a consumer without first verifying the consumer's reasonable ability to to make the scheduled payments of principal, interest (including variable interest), real estate taxes, homeowner's insurance, assessments, and mortgage insurance premiums. </p> <p>Prescribes criteria to: (1) determine such consumer's reasonable ability to pay a variable interest rate; and (2) verify the consumer's income and financial resources. Declares a consumer's statement of income or financial resources insufficient evidence of the consumer's financial status.</p> <p>Prohibits consumer equity in the principal dwelling that secures the consumer credit transaction from being used to establish ability to make payments.</p> <p>Prohibits a mortgage broker or creditor from: (1) steering, counseling, or directing a consumer to rates, charges, principal amount, or prepayment terms that are more expensive than those for which the consumer qualifies; (2) arranging for any consumer credit transaction secured by the principal dwelling of a consumer that is more expensive than that for which the consumer qualifies; (3) engaging in certain mischaracterizations.</p> <p>Prohibits prepayment penalties. Limits finance points, charges, and fees. Cites duties owed to a consumer by a mortgage broker.</p> <p>Requires creditors and mortgage brokers to obtain independent verification that a borrower seeking to refinance a special mortgage has received counseling on the transaction's advisability. Defines &quot;special mortgage&quot; as one that: (1) was originated, subsidized, funded, or guaranteed by or through a state, tribal, or local government, or nonprofit organization; and (2) bears one or more specified nonstandard payment terms which substantially benefit the consumer.</p> <p>Prescribes minimum financial requirements for mortgage brokers.</p> <p>Excludes reverse mortgages from coverage by this Act.</p>]]></text>
