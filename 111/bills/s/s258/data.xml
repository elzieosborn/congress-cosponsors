  <summary date="2010-08-23T15:41:45Z" status="Passed Senate amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on July 22, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act of 2010 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to make it unlawful for any adult (at least 18 years of age) to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or create, with intent to manufacture, create, distribute, or dispense, a Schedule I or II controlled substance that is: (1) combined with a candy product; (2) marketed or packaged to appear similar to a candy product; or (3) modified by flavoring or coloring with the intent to distribute, dispense, or sell it to a person under 18 years of age. Imposes enhanced criminal penalties for violations. Exempts any controlled substance that has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the drug approval process or that has been altered at the direction of a medical practitioner for a legitimate medical purpose.

Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review and amend its sentencing guidelines and policy statements to reflect the enhanced penalties provided by this Act.</summary>
