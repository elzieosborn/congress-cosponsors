  <summary date="2010-06-22T17:42:02Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Veteran Employment Transition Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise the definition of "qualified veteran" for purposes of the work opportunity tax credit to mean recently discharged veterans and disadvantaged veterans.

Defines "recently discharged veteran" to mean: (1) any individual who has served on active duty (other than active duty for training) in the Armed Forces for more than 180 total days (whether consecutive or not); (2) any individual who has been discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability; and (3) any member of the National Guard who has served for more than 180 total days (whether consecutive or not) in active duty, full-time National Guard duty, or duty in state status.

Defines "disadvantaged veteran" as any veteran who is certified as being a member of a family receiving assistance under a supplemental nutrition assistance program and is entitled to compensation for a service-connected disability.

Requires the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Guard to inform military personnel who are discharged or released from active duty of the work opportunity tax credit and provide them with documentation relating to eligibility for and use of such credit.</summary>
