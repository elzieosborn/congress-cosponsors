    "text": "Part-Time Reemployment of Annuitants Act of 2009 - Allows a federal agency head (other than for the Government Accountability Office [GAO]) to waive the application of civil service retirement system and federal employee retirement system provisions restricting annuities and pay upon reemployment with respect to an annuitant employed as a limited time appointee (an annuitant appointed under a temporary appointment limited to one year or less) if the annuitant's employment is necessary to: (1) fulfill functions critical to the mission of the agency or any component thereof; (2) assist in the implementation or oversight of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 or the Troubled Asset Relief Program; (3) assist in the development, management, or oversight of agency procurement actions; (4) assist the Inspector General for that agency in the performance of that Inspector General's mission; (5) promote appropriate training or mentoring programs of employees; (6) assist in the recruitment or retention of employees; or (7) respond to an emergency involving a direct threat to life or property or other unusual circumstances.\n\nProhibits waiving such provisions with respect to an annuitant for more than: (1) 520 hours of service performed during the six months following the individual's annuity commencing date; (2) 1040 hours of service performed during any 12-month period; or (3) a total of 3120 hours of service performed by that annuitant. Limits the total number of annuitants to whom such a waiver may apply to not more than 2.5% of the total number of full-time agency employees. Requires an agency head to submit a justification if the number of annuitants to whom a waiver applies exceeds 1% of the number of employees.\n\nTerminates such waiver authority five years after this Act's enactment.\n\nSets forth reporting requirements by agency heads and by the Comptroller General."
