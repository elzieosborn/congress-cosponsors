Allows any PHA that owns or operates fewer than 500 public housing units under the United States Housing Act of 1937 to elect to be exempt from asset management requirements imposed by the Secretary.

Prohibits the Secretary from imposing any requirement relating to asset management restricting the use by PHAs of amounts for Capital Fund assistance for costs of any PHA central office.

Requires the Secretary to ensure that PHAs encourage the reasonable efforts of residents to organize.</summary>
