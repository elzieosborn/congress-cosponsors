    "text": "Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny to taxpayers with gross revenues in excess of $100 million in a taxable year (applicable large taxpayers): (1) the tax deduction for intangible drilling and development costs; (2) the tax deduction for qualified tertiary injectant expenses; (3) the exemption from restrictions on the deductibility of passive losses; (4) the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells; and (5) the tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production of oil, natural gas, or primary products thereof.\n\nRequires applicable large taxpayers to amortize their geological and geophysical expenditures over a seven-year period.\n\nImposes on producers of taxable crude oil or natural gas a 13% excise tax on the removal price of such oil and natural gas produced from lands on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Allows a nonrefundable credit against such tax for royalties paid under federal law with respect to the production of such crude oil and natural gas.\n\nDenies a foreign tax credit to any large integrated oil company that is subject to a levy of a foreign country or possession of the United States and receives an economic benefit from such country or possession (dual capacity taxpayer) if such country or possession does not impose a generally applicable income tax."
