    "text": "Equity in Excellence Act of 2010 - Amends title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish an Equity in Excellence Grant program authorizing the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to eligible entities for efforts to ensure that the academic achievement rates of high-achieving students in grades one through four, who are from impoverished families and served by high-need local educational agencies (LEAs), do not fall behind the achievement rates of their more advantaged, high-achieving peers.\n\nLists as eligible grantees: (1) high-need LEAs; (2) consortia of LEAs that include high-need LEAs; and (3) partnerships composed of high-need LEAs and institutions of higher education or nonprofits that have expertise in educating gifted students.\n\nRequires the use of grant funds to: (1) ensure that assessments provide diagnostic information that informs the instruction of high-achieving students; (2) implement evidence-based, innovative educational strategies, such as enrichment programs and academic acceleration strategies; (3) procure or use high-quality instructional materials; (4) train school personnel involved in teaching high-achieving students from impoverished families; and (5) conduct education and training for such students' parents that supports their children's excellence.\n\nAllows the Secretary to extend such grants based on recipient performance.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) collect data annually comparing the longitudinal achievement levels of the students served by this Act's grants with their more advantaged peers; and (2) release such data for analysis to independent research institutions."
