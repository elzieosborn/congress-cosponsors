  <summary date="2010-06-03T20:28:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Support Renewable Energy Act of 2010 - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as it would be amended by the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 as reported to the Senate as an original measure on July 16, 2009 (S.1462), to revise the Federal Renewable Electricity Standard by expanding the definition of "renewable energy" to include energy produced through the use of customer-sited renewable energy equipment, including solar water heating, solar water and space heating or cooling, solar daylight and light-pipe technology, biogas, and ground source geothermal heat pump energy applications. Revises the Federal Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Credit Trading Programs by requiring the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: (1) issue renewable energy credits equal to 100% of the electricity (or thermal energy expressed in an electricity-equivalent) displaced by qualifying renewable energy equipment; and (2) allocate such credits and credits for generators of electric energy produced through distributed generations facilities issued to the utility, project owner, and end user that paid for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of such equipment, on the basis of the cost incurred.</summary>
