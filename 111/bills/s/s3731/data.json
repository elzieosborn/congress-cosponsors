Allows the award of a grant in a stage only to an eligible entity that: (1) submits a bid meeting the specifications developed for that stage; and (2) provides an assurance that the grant funds will be used to develop an RoIP device in accordance with the specifications included in that bid. Sets forth additional factors for the Assistant Secretary to consider when making a grant.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to conduct an audit of such competition.\n\nDirects the FCC to establish a voluntary labeling program for the identification of nonstationary RoIP devices that meet such criteria as considered appropriate to support mission-critical broadband voice and data communications of public safety personnel."
