Excludes the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Executive Office of the President, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Secret Service.

Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) determine the current number of full-time employees of DOD and DHS; and (2) maintain that number by offsetting each new appointment by a reduction.

Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) publicly disclose the total number of federal employees, the number of federal employees in each agency, and the annual rate of pay by title of each federal employee at each agency; and (2) update such information at least once a year.
