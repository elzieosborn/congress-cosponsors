  <summary date="2010-02-03T20:30:16Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Blind Persons Return to Work Act of 2010 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to: (1) apply a specified earnings test in the determination of the amount of monthly insurance benefits for blind beneficiaries; (2) limit to once a year any review of a determination of disability based on blindness; and (3) reduce any excess earnings of blind beneficiaries by the amount of impairment related work expenses.

Directs the Commissioner of Social Security, with respect to the mandatory annual report of earnings by an individual entitled to a monthly insurance benefit, to develop procedures to avoid paying less than the correct amount of benefits to any such individual as a result, during the year, of a termination of employment or a significant reduction in hours of work.</summary>
