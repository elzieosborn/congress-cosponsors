  <summary date="2010-11-19T21:11:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to study and report to specified congressional committees on the potential impact on consumers of increasing the amount of ethanol blended with gasoline or other petroleum products for use as fuel for internal combustion engines.

Directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to study and report to specified congressional committees on whether the use of ethanol-gasoline blends of more than 10% by volume ethanol in motor vehicles will have an adverse impact on tailpipe emissions, exhaust temperatures, catalytic converters, and motor vehicle engine performance and durability.

Declares the sense of Congress that federal departments and agencies should withhold from approving any increase in the use of ethanol or ethanol-gasoline blends as fuel for internal combustion engines until 30 days after both such reports have been submitted.</summary>
