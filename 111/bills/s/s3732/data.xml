  <summary date="2010-09-01T15:18:05Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to: (1) promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in secondary schools; (2) support the participation of secondary school students in nonprofit robotics or STEM competitions; and (3) broaden secondary school students' access to STEM careers.

Allows secondary schools to apply for such grants if their LEA does not.

Gives priority to grant applications that address the needs of: (1) rural or urban schools; (2) low-performing schools or school districts; or (3) LEAs or schools that serve at least 10,000 poor children or a student population at least 20% of which is poor.

Authorizes the Secretary to waive all or part of the matching requirement for financially-strapped LEAs or schools.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) publicize the grant program and nontraditional STEM teaching methods; and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the grant program.</summary>
