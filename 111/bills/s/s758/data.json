Requires all coins to be minted at West Point, New York.\n\nProhibits numismatic coins from being made available as so-called \"fractional\" coins.\n\nRequires the Secretary to take specified protective and anti-counterfeiting measures.\n\nInstructs the Treasury Inspector General to report to certain congressional committees on the extent of counterfeiting of rare, collectible, or numismatic coins for sale in the United States, regardless of the country where the original of such coin was produced or of the country in which the counterfeiting takes place, or sales overseas if such counterfeit coins are unauthorized copies of coins originally produced by the U.S. Mint."
