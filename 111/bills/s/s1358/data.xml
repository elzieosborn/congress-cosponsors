Authorizes the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to use funds made available under provisions of the Act commonly known as the Trademark Act of 1946 (relating to fees) to support the processing of patents and other activities, services, and materials relating to patents, notwithstanding provisions restricting the use of such fees to activities relating trademark registrations, if: (1) the Director certifies to Congress that the use of such funds is reasonably necessary to avoid USPTO furloughs or a reduction-in-force, or both; and (2) funds so used are repaid to trademark operations not later than September 30, 2011.

Terminates such authority on June 30, 2010.</summary>
