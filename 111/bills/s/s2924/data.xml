Boys &amp; Girls Clubs Centennial Reauthorization Act of 2009 - Amends the Economic Espionage Act of 1966 to reauthorize through FY2015 the mandate for an annual grant to the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America from the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance of the Department of Justice.

Repeals the limitation on the use of such grants to expansion of the organization to 1,500 additional Boys and Girls Clubs for a total number of at least 5,000 Boys and Girls Clubs of America facilities in operation before January 1, 2010.

Replaces the expansion requirement with a goal of improving the quality of youth development and educational programs, health, physical fitness, and prevention services for youth at existing and new Boys &amp; Girls Clubs facilities, with special emphasis on reducing high school dropout rates.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015.</summary>
