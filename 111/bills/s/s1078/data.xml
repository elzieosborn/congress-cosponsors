Requires the Secretary, acting through the USGS data archive, development, maintenance, and product distribution program conducted at the Earth Resources Observation and Science Data Center (AmericaView project), to support the geospatial imagery mapping research and educational programs of each state by cooperating with states to identify new geospatial imagery mapping needs and infrastructure and to define, consolidate, and maintain the data requirements of the AmericaView project.

Directs the Secretary to maintain AmericaView in each state for specified purposes, including: (1) to share and cooperate in the development of geospatial imagery mapping applications, education, and training infrastructure in each state; and (2) to promote cooperation and sharing of expertise regarding geospatial imagery among and within participating states.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide grants, annually, to sustain and develop StateView programs (AmericaView programs of individual states, comprised of educational institutions and state and local governments); and (2) maintain an advisory committee to advise the Director regarding the AmericaView program.
