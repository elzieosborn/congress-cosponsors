  <summary date="2011-01-27T23:20:07Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Earmark Transparency Act - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of the Senate, the Senate Sergeant of Arms, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to begin the development of a single free public searchable website that specifies certain identifying information relating to each request by Members of Congress for congressionally directed spending items or limited tax or tariff benefits (congressional earmarks).

Requires a request for a congressional earmark from a Member of Congress to be made available on the website within five days after its submission to a congressional committee.

Places on the requesting Member the burden of providing the required information in a timely manner and in compliance with this Act to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House. Places on the chair of each committee to which the request is made, however, the burden of providing: (1) the amount approved by the committee; (2) the amount approved in the final legislation (if approved); and (3) the name of the federal department or agency through which the entity will receive the funding. Allows transfer to the office of the Secretary of the Senate, to pay for costs associated with the website, of any unobligated or unspent funds remaining at the end of FY2010 or FY2011 from the Official Personnel and Office Expense Account of any Senator who agrees to the transfer.</summary>
