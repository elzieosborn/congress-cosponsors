  <summary date="2010-09-02T20:20:48Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act Reauthorization of 2009 - Amends the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) to reauthorize, until July 25, 2020, the program for the completion of appraisals and satisfaction of other legal requirements for the sale or exchange of public land identified for disposal under approved land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.

Revises the FLTFA definition of "federally designated area" to include all the lands within specified boundaries. (Current law is limited to lands which, as of July 25, 2000, were within such specified boundaries.)

Makes the FLTFA non-applicable to land eligible for sale under specified public land laws.</summary>
