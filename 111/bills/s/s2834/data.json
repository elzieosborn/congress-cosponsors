    "text": "Security Clearance Modernization and Reporting Act of 2009 - Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to extend national security clearance report requirements to the earlier of two years after the Comptroller General has removed all security clearance-related items from the list known as the High-Risk List, or 2017. (Under current law, such report requirement runs through 2011.) Adds to required report information a description of the full range of time required to complete initial clearance applications.\n\nEstablishes the Security Clearance and Suitability Performance Accountability Council to perform specified duties, and oversee the development of techniques, relating to the enhancement of applicant suitability determinations and security clearances, including holding each U.S. agency accountable for its security procedures.\n\nDirects the Council to develop and submit to Congress a strategic plan that identifies the causes of problems with the issuance of security clearances and a description of corrective actions to address such problems.\n\nRequires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to submit to Congress an information technology strategy for expediting the security clearance process and for providing security clearance and suitability determination reform consistent with the Report of the Joint Security and Suitability Reform Team, dated December 20, 2008."
