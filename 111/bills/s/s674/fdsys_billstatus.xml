        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Federal Supervisor Training Act of 2009 - Revises provisions relating to specific training programs for federal agency supervisors. Requires the head of each federal agency to establish: (1) a program to provide training to supervisors on developing and discussing relevant goals and objectives with the employee, communicating and discussing progress on performance goals and objectives and conducting performance appraisals, mentoring and motivating employees and improving employee performance and productivity, fostering a work environment characterized by fairness, respect, equal opportunity, and attention paid to the merit of the work of employees, effectively managing employees with unacceptable performance, and addressing reports of a hostile work environment, reprisal, or harassment; (2) a program to provide training to supervisors on prohibited personnel practices, employee collective bargaining and union participation rights, and processes to enforce employee rights; and (3) a program under which experienced supervisors mentor new supervisors. Requires supervisors to complete such programs every three years.</p> <p>Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue guidance to federal agencies on competencies supervisors are expected to meet in order to effectively manage, and be accountable for managing, the performance of employees. Requires each agency to: (1) develop competencies to assess the performance of each supervisor; (2) assess the overall capacity of the supervisors in the agency to meet such guidance; (3) develop and implement a supervisor training program to strengthen issues identified during such assessment; and (4) measure the effectiveness of that program in improving supervisor competence. </p>]]></text>
