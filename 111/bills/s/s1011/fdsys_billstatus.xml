Extends federal recognition to the governing entity as the representative governing body of the Native Hawaiian people. </p> <p>Authorizes the United States, upon the reaffirmation of such political and legal relationship, together with the state of Hawaii, to enter into negotiations with the governing entity to lead to an agreement addressing specified matters, including the transfer of lands, natural resources, and other assets, and the protection of existing rights related to such lands or resources.</p>]]></text>
