  <summary date="2010-04-28T21:30:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Medicare Rural Health Care Equity Act of 2010 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), to revise the practice expense portion of the geographic adjustment applied in a fee schedule area for physicians' services furnished in 2010 and subsequent years. Reduces the employee wage and rent portions of the index for 2010 from 3/4 to 1/2 of the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such employee wages and rents. Reduces the same portions of the index for 2011 from 1/2 to 1/4 of such differences.

Amends PPACA to repeal specified floors for frontier states: (1) on the area wage index for hospitals; (2) on the area wage adjustment factor for hospital outpatient department services; and (3) for the practice expense index for services furnished in such states.</summary>
