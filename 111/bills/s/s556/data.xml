  <summary date="2009-04-15T20:00:09Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Firearms Transfer Improvement Act - Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) expand the authority of licensed importers, manufacturers, dealers or collectors (licensees) of firearms to sell or deliver firearms (currently, limited to rifles or shotguns) to residents of a state other than the state in which the licensee's place of business is located (or temporarily located) if the sale or delivery complies with the laws of the state in which the sale or delivery is conducted (currently, must comply with the laws of the state of both the seller and the purchaser); and (2) allow licensees to conduct business temporarily at any gun show or event sponsored by any national, state, or local organization, or any affiliate devoted to the collection, competitive use, or other sporting use of firearms (currently, only at such a location in the state specified on the licensee's license).

Reaffirms the right of licensees to conduct: (1) firearms transfers (currently, "curios or relics" firearms transfers) with another licensee away from their business premises; and (2) firearms transfers and business with nonlicensees at any location at which the licensee is authorized to conduct business.</summary>
