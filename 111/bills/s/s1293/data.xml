  <summary date="2009-07-06T21:24:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Enhancing Child Health with Automatic School Meal Enrollment Act of 2009 - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to make performance awards to states that demonstrate outstanding performance or show substantial improvement in directly certifying children whose families are eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 as eligible for free meals under the school lunch and breakfast programs. (Direct certification eliminates the need for such families to submit applications for participation in the school lunch and breakfast programs.)

Requires each state that directly certifies less than 95% of their children who are eligible for direct certification to implement a direct certification improvement plan that is approved by the Secretary.

Directs the Secretary of Education to report to Congress on how statewide databases used to track compliance with the requirements of the school improvement program under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 can be used for the purposes of direct certification.</summary>
