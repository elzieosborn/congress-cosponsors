  <summary date="2010-05-07T14:56:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Broadband Service Consumer Protection Act - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to start a rulemaking to assist consumers: (1) in making realistic assumptions, before they purchase broadband service, about the actual speeds that may reasonably be expected and how those assumptions may be affected by the consumer's hardware, peak service periods, and other factors; and (2) in determining, after they purchase broadband service, whether they are getting the level of broadband service for which they are paying.

Requires the FCC, in those regulations, to establish, and revise as needed, technical standards for quantifying broadband service measures of performance and other features.</summary>
