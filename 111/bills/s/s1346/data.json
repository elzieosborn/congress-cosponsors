Exempts prosecutions under this Act from any statute of limitations.\n\nProhibits a prosecution for a violation of this Act in the United States unless the Attorney General certifies in writing that: (1) there is no foreign jurisdiction prepared to prosecute a violation of this Act and a prosecution by the United States is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice; and (2) the Secretaries of State and Defense and the Director of National Intelligence do not object to a prosecution.\n\nProvides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) make unlawful conduct pursuant to the laws of war; (2) limit or extinguish any otherwise available defense or immunity; (3) support ratification of, or participation by the United States in, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; or (4) repeal or limit the applicability of the American Servcemembers' Protection Act of 2002."
