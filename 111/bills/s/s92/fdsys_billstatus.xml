        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Imported Seafood Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) issue an order refusing admission into the United States of all imports of seafood or seafood products originating from a country or exporter which the Secretary determines do not meet food safety requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or which are not likely to meet food safety requirements of any other federal law; and (2) notify all U.S. ports of entry of such refusal within five days. Requires shipments denied admission to be clearly marked &quot;Refused Entry by the United States Government.&quot; </p> <p>Requires the importer of such a rejected shipment headed for its country of origin to notify the appropriate authority of such country of the reasons admission was refused before the shipment may be released to the importer. </p><p>Requires the importer of such a rejected shipment bound for a third party country to notify such country's appropriate authority about such refusal, and requires such authority to notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it accepts such shipment, before the shipment may be released to the importer. Requires the shipment to be destroyed if such authority's notification of acceptance is not made within 45 days after it is notified of the rejection.</p>]]></text>
