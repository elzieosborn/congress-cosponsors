Conditions such a designation on whether: (1) the area is nominated by one or more local governments, including municipal and county authorities; and (2) the local government provides written assurances that it convened a SCORE advisory committee to enter into a collaborative community planning process to determine the SCORE project area to be nominated, and meets other related criteria.

Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to local governments to: (1) create strategic plans for SCORE project areas; and (2) fund activities to revitalize such areas.

Exempts any economic development project located within a SCORE project area receiving HCDA funds from HCDA public benefit standards.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) a three-year work opportunity tax credit for the hiring of employees who perform services for a trade or business located in a SCORE project area; and (2) an additional depreciation allowance for business or investment property located in such an area.</summary>
