Prohibits applying these amendments to alleged discrimination relating to pensions or pension benefits.

Applies the above Civil Rights Act of 1964 amendment to discrimination claims brought under: (1) specified provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and (2) provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relating to employment by the federal government.</summary>
