  <summary date="2010-10-22T21:40:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Diverse Teachers Recruitment Act of 2010 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) or nonprofits, educational service agencies, institutions of higher education, or states that enter into partnerships with such LEAs for: (1) recruiting individuals from underrepresented groups as public elementary and secondary school teachers; and (2) providing training and retention incentives to public elementary and secondary school teachers, preferably teachers from underrepresented groups.

Prohibits grants to applicants that do not serve schools that have difficulty recruiting, training, and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups as teachers.

Gives priority to LEAs that serve the most high-need schools and those that serve schools with high concentrations of poor, minority, disabled, or limited English proficient students.

Requires the Secretary to evaluate the success of the grantees and compile a database of best practices for recruiting, training, and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups as public elementary and secondary school teachers.</summary>
