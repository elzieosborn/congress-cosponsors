Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to increase the electromagnetic spectrum allocation for public safety services by 10 megahertz.

Permits the FCC, if consistent with the public interest for a licensee to relinquish voluntarily some or all of its licensed spectrum usage rights in order to permit the assignment of new initial licenses, to disburse to that licensee portions of the auction proceeds related to the new use that are attributable to the licensee's relinquished spectrum usage.
