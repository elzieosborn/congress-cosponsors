  <summary date="2009-05-13T20:17:59Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Medicare Quality and Payment Reform Act of 2009 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to: (1) review annually high volume readmission rates and resource use; (2) establish benchmarks for measuring them; and (3) make payment adjustments for subsection (d) hospitals that fail to meet such benchmarks.

(Generally, a subsection (d) hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program to provide episodic payments to hospitals and other organizing entities for items and services associated with hospitalization episodes of Medicare beneficiaries with respect to one or more conditions that have a high volume, high readmission rate, or high rate of post-acute care under the Medicare program.</summary>
