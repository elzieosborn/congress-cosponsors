Directs the Secretary of Energy to coordinate efforts with the Energy Star program.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) promote practices, recognize companies, and recognize products that comply with the Supply Star program as the preferred practices, companies, and products in the marketplace for maximizing supply chain efficiency; (2) work to enhance industry and public awareness of the program; (3) collect and disseminate data on supply chain energy resource consumption; (4) develop and disseminate metrics, processes, and analytical tools (including software) for evaluating supply chain energy resource use; (5) develop guidance at the sector level for improving supply chain efficiency; (6) work with domestic and international organizations to harmonize approaches to analyzing supply chain efficiency; and (7) work with industry, including small businesses, to improve supply chain efficiency through activities that include developing and sharing best practices and providing opportunities to benchmark supply chain efficiency.\n\nDirects the Secretary, in any evaluation of supply chain efficiency carried out by the Secretary with respect to a specific product, to consider energy consumption and resource use throughout the entire lifecycle of a product, including production, transport, packaging, use, and disposal.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to award grants or other incentives on a competitive basis to eligible entities for purposes of: (1) studying supply chain energy resource efficiency; and (2) demonstrating and achieving reductions in the energy resource consumption of commercial products through changes and improvements to the production supply and distribution chain of the products. Directs the Secretary to use funds to support professional training programs to develop and communicate methods, practices, and tools for improving supply chain efficiency. Provides that: (1) the impact on climate change shall not be a factor in determining supply chain efficiency; and (2) the outsourcing of American jobs in the production of a product shall not count as a positive factor in determining supply chain efficiency."
