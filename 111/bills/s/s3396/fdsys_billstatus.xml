        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Supply Star Act of 2010 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to establish within the Department of Energy (DOE) a Supply Star program to identify and promote practices, companies, and products that use highly efficient supply chains in a manner that conserves energy, water, and other resources. Directs the Secretary of Energy to coordinate efforts with the Energy Star program.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to: (1) promote practices, companies, and products that comply with the Supply Star program as the preferred practices, companies, and products in the marketplace for maximizing supply chain efficiency; (2) work to enhance industry and public awareness of the program; (3) collect and disseminate data on supply chain energy resource consumption; (4) develop and disseminate metrics, processes, and analytical tools (including software) for evaluating supply chain energy resource use; (5) develop guidance at the sector level for improving supply chain efficiency; (6) work with domestic and international organizations to harmonize approaches to analyzing supply chain efficiency; and (7) work with industry, including small businesses, to improve supply chain efficiency through activities that include developing and sharing best practices and providing opportunities to benchmark supply chain efficiency.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to consider energy and resource use throughout the entire lifecycle of a product.</p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or other incentives on a competitive basis to eligible entities for purposes of: (1) studying supply chain energy resource efficiency; and (2) demonstrating and achieving reductions in the energy resource consumption of commercial products through changes and improvements to the production supply and distribution chain of the products.
