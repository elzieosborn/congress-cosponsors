  <summary date="2009-11-23T20:02:25Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Take Back Your Health Act of 2009 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to cover intensive lifestyle treatment, which is a physician-supervised program furnishing to eligible beneficiaries certain exercise, medication, nutritional, and other specified items and services intended to affect beneficially the progression of chronic coronary heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, prostate cancer, or breast cancer.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a Lifestyle Rewards Program for eligible beneficiaries who have successfully completed an intensive lifestyle program and meet certain other requirements.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the services provided under an intensive lifestyle treatment program: (1) would benefit individuals with chronic diseases who are not enrolled in the Medicare program; and (2) should be covered by all public and private payers.</summary>
