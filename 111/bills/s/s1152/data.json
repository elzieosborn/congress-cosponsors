Grants the same authority, for employees under their jurisdiction, to the Librarian of Congress, the Comptroller General, the Board of Directors of the congressional Office of Compliance, and the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n\nAuthorizes civil actions by employees, individuals, or their representatives for damages or equitable relief against employers who violate this Act.\n\nWaives a state's sovereign immunity with respect to a suit brought by an employee of a federally-assisted state program or activity for relief authorized under this Act.\n\nRequires the Commissioner of Labor Statistics annually to compile information annually on paid sick time, and the Comptroller General to study related matters.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to discourage employers from adopting or retaining more generous leave policies."
