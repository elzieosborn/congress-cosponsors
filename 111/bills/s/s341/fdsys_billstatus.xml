        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Main Street Manufacturing Communities Reinvestment Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to revise the economic adjustment assistance grant program.</p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) waive the requirement that a manufacturing area suffering from severe unemployment or severe changes in economic conditions have a comprehensive economic develop strategy prior to a request for a grant for a project to alleviate such special need, provided it has a streamlined economic development strategy plan approved by the Governor; and (2) provide assistance to alleviate economic dislocation in a manufacturing area regardless of whether it was sudden or arose more than 24 months before the filing for a grant.</p> <p>Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to authorize the Secretary of Labor to award national emergency grants to an eligible entity to provide employment and training assistance to manufacturing workers who lost employment due to a plant closure, or mass layoff, or experienced a change in employment status due to a plant shutdown, at a single employment site for 50 or more workers. Allows the use of such a grant to provide a job search allowance and a relocation allowance of up to $1,250 each, as well as needs-related payments to an eligible manufacturing worker. </p> <p>Revises energy efficiency and renewable energy worker training program eligibility requirements. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) award advanced training partnership grants to eligible institutions of higher education for the design, engineering, manufacture, or supply of equipment for new technologically advanced, energy efficient, and renewable fuel powered motor vehicles; and (2) provide other services to upgrade the skills of automobile industry workers (including equipment supply industry workers) to manufacture such vehicles.</p>]]></text>
