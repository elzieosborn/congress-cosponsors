        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Connecting Education and Emerging Professions Act of 2009 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to establish a Connecting Education and Emerging Professions Demonstration Grant program awarding competitive matching grants to states and local educational agencies (LEAs) that partner with businesses, postsecondary institutions, workforce investment boards, labor organizations, or nonprofit community organizations.</p> <p>Requires such grants to be used to: (1) assess emerging industry pathways and the academic skills needed to succeed in them; (2) design school- and work-based curricula or programs to teach such skills; (3) implement the new curricula or programs in schools where at least 30% of the students are impoverished, that have graduation rates below their state's average, and whose community is experiencing significant or increased unemployment; and (4) evaluate best practices from such curricula or programs and disseminate them to other educational entities. </p> <p>Requires such curricula or programs to: (1) meet challenging state academic content standards; and (2) prepare students for both direct entry into careers with emerging industries in their communities and success in postsecondary education.</p>]]></text>
