  <summary date="2010-11-22T16:35:11Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act of 2010 or DREAM Act of 2010 - Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to repeal the provision making unlawful aliens ineligible for higher education benefits based on state residence unless a U.S. citizen or national is eligible for such benefits without regard to state residence.

Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to cancel the removal of, and adjust to conditional permanent resident status, an alien who: (1) entered the United States before his or her 16th birthday and has been present in the United States for at least five years immediately preceding this Act's enactment; (2) is a person of good moral character; (3) is not inadmissible or deportable under specified grounds of the Immigration and Nationality Act; (4) has been admitted to an institution of higher education (IHE) or has earned a high school or equivalent diploma; (5) from the age of 16 and older, has never been under a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal; and (6) was under age 35 on the date of this Act's enactment.

Requires aliens to apply for such adjustment of status within one year of being admitted to an IHE or earning a high school or equivalent diploma.

Sets forth conditions for maintaining such status and having its conditional basis removed.

Authorizes an alien who has satisfied the appropriate requirements before this Act's enactment to petition the Secretary for conditional permanent resident status.

Provides for: (1) exclusive jurisdiction; (2) penalties for false application statements; (3) confidentiality; (4) higher education assistance; and (5) a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report respecting the number of aliens adjusted under this Act.</summary>
