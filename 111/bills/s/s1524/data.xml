Requires: (1) any organization or business that receives more than 50% of its funding from the U.S. government under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to submit a report to USAID that contains the names and all forms of compensation paid to its five most highly compensated employees; and (2) USAID to make such information publicly accessible on its web site.
