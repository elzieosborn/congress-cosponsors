Includes as routine patient costs all items and services provided in the clinical trial that are otherwise generally available to a qualified individual, with certain exceptions.\n\nApplies such prohibitions to coverage offered in the individual market and coverage offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n\nMakes this Act effective January 1, 2009.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study the impact on group health plans of requiring them to cover routine patient care costs for individuals with serious and life threatening diseases other than cancer."
