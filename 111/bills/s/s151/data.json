    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)\n\nIndian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act of 2009 - Amends the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 to expand the authority of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board to bring criminal and civil actions for offenses under such Act involving the sale of misrepresented Indian produced goods or products. Authorizes: (1) any federal law enforcement officer to conduct an investigation of an alleged violation of this Act occurring within the jurisdiction of the United States; and (2) the Indian Arts and Crafts Board to refer an alleged violation to any federal law enforcement officer (currently, only to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)) for investigation. Permits federal law enforcement officers to investigate an alleged violation regardless of whether the Board makes a referral of an alleged violation.\n\nRequires the findings of any investigation of an alleged violation to be submitted to a federal or state prosecuting authority or the Indian Arts and Crafts Board. Authorizes the Board, upon receiving the findings of such an investigation, to: (1) recommend to the Attorney General that criminal proceedings be initiated (current law); (2) provide such support to the Attorney General relating to the criminal proceedings as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate; or (3) recommend, in lieu of, or in addition to, any such criminal proceeding, that the Attorney General initiate a civil action. Allows the Attorney General, an Indian tribe, an Indian, or an Indian arts and crafts organization to initiate a civil action under this Act.\n\nAmends the federal criminal code to revise penalties for the sale of misrepresented Indian produced goods and products."
