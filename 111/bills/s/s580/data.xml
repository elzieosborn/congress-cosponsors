Describes such a foreign statute as one that has the effect of nullifying all or part of a final judgment of a U.S. court under the Antidumping Act of 1916 by enabling a foreign defendant that has paid damages pursuant to such judgment to recover any portion of them from the U.S. plaintiff (or affiliate).

Authorizes a U.S. plaintiff (or affiliate) held liable, or required to forfeit or pay damages, pursuant to a foreign judgment to file a civil action for the amount of such damages (plus interest and costs) against the foreign defendant that obtained damages pursuant to the foreign judgment.</summary>
