Russell National School Lunch Act to increase reimbursement rates for free, reduced price, and paid meals and snacks served under the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) at nonresidential child care centers and family or group day care homes.\n\nAllows such providers to be reimbursed for the service of three meals and a snack. (Currently, reimbursement is provided for two meals and a snack.)\n\nLowers the percentage of children or school children in an area that must be eligible for free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs to make family or group day care homes in the area eligible for higher CACFP reimbursement rates as tier I homes.\n\nIncreases the maximum monthly administrative payment per home provided to sponsors of family or group day care homes.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Agriculture to improve the ability of the CACFP to reach low-income families by streamlining program and paperwork requirements."
