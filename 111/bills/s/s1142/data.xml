Defines "comparative clinical effectiveness" as the clinical outcomes, effectiveness, safety, and clinical appropriateness of a drug or device in comparison to one or more drugs or devices approved to prevent, diagnose, or treat the same health condition in the same patient demographic subpopulation.
