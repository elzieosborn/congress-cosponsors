        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Aviation Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 - Establishes in the Department of Transportation (DOT) an Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office to receive and assess complaints and information relating to possible violations of aviation safety laws and regulations.</p> <p>Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify the FAA customer service initiative, mission and vision, and other policy statements to: (1) remove any reference to air carriers and other entities regulated by the FAA as &quot;customers&quot;; (2) state that in regulating safety the only FAA customers are individuals traveling on aircraft; and (3) state that air carriers and other entities regulated by the FAA do not have the right to select the FAA employees who will inspect their operations.</p> <p>Prohibits any person holding an air carrier operating certificate from knowingly employing, or engaging in employment negotiations or making a contractual employment arrangement with an FAA employee if, in the preceding two-year period, the employee: (1) served as, or was responsible for oversight of, an FAA flight standards inspector; and (2) had responsibility to inspect, or oversee inspection of, the operations of the certificate holder.</p> <p>Prohibits any individual serving as a principal supervisory inspector of the FAA from being responsible for overseeing the operations of the same air carrier for a continuous period of more than five years.</p> <p>Directs the FAA Administrator to: (1) modify the Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program to require inspectors to verify that air carriers implement solutions to correct violations they have voluntarily disclosed and evaluate, before accepting a new report of a previously disclosed violation, whether such air carriers took such corrective actions; (2) establish a process for the review and approval of voluntary self-disclosures about practices received from air carriers; (3) establish a National Review Team to conduct periodic, unannounced audits throughout the United States of air carrier operations and maintenance practices and procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of FAA air carrier oversight; and (4) establish a process for the monthly review of the FAA air transportation oversight system database by FAA employees.</p>]]></text>
