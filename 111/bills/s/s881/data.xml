  <summary date="2009-05-26T21:27:30Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Southeast Alaska Native Land Entitlement Finalization Act - Authorizes Sealaska Corporation, the Regional Corporation for southeast Alaska, notwithstanding specified provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and subject to conditions and restrictions, to select and receive conveyance of its remaining land entitlement under the ANCSA from federal land in southeast Alaska from each of the following categories: (1) specified economic development land; (2) sites with sacred, cultural, traditional, or historical significance; and (3) Alaska Native futures sites with traditional and recreational use value.

Authorizes the Director of the National Park Service to enter into a cooperative management agreement with Sealaska, other village corporations and urban corporations, and federally recognized Indian tribes with cultural and historical ties to Glacier Bay National Park to recognize and perpetuate National Park Service values, including those associated with the Tlingit homeland and culture, wilderness, and ecological preservation.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to complete the conveyance of lands to Sealaska within one year of selection.

Prohibits Sealaska from selecting or receiving any conveyance of lands under this Act from within any conservation system unit, federally designated wilderness area, or certain land use designation areas.

Amends the National Historic Preservation Act to add to the definition of "tribal lands" land held under the ANCSA by an incorporated Alaska Native group, a Regional Corporation, or a Village Corporation.</summary>
