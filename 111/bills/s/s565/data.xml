  <summary date="2009-04-16T20:03:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Kidney Transplant Patients Act of 2009 - Amends SSA title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) to: (1) continue entitlement to prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy furnished to an individual who receives a kidney transplant for which payment is made under Medicare; and (2) extend Medicare secondary payer requirements for end stage renal disease (ESRD) beneficiaries.

Amends title XVIII (Medicare ) of SSA to apply special rules to kidney transplant recipients receiving additional coverage for immunosuppressive drugs. Deems such individual to be enrolled under Medicare part B and makes the individual responsible for the full amount of the applicable premiums. Applies deductible and coinsurance requirements to the provision of such drugs.

Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to set forth requirements for group health plans to provide coverage of immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant patients.</summary>
