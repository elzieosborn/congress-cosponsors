Allows each cost incurred by the District after January 1, 2003, relating to any capital, planning, design, permitting, construction, or land acquisition (including the value of reallocated water rights) for the project to be credited towards the non-federal share of the project's costs.\n\nProhibits funds provided by the Secretary from being used for the project's operation or maintenance.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations."
