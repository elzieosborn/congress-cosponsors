  <summary date="2010-12-10T16:30:22Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Magna Water District Water Reuse and Groundwater Recharge Act of 2009 - Amends the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Magna Water District, Utah, to participate in the design, planning, and construction of permanent facilities needed to establish recycled water distribution and wastewater treatment and reclamation facilities that will be used to provide recycled water in that District.

Limits the federal share of the capital cost of the project to 25% of the total cost of the project. Allows each cost incurred by the District after January 1, 2003, relating to any capital, planning, design, permitting, construction, or land acquisition (including the value of reallocated water rights) for the project to be credited towards the non-federal share of the project's costs.

Prohibits funds provided by the Secretary from being used for the project's operation or maintenance.

Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
