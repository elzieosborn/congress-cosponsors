  <summary date="2011-01-05T20:40:36Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Puget Sound Recovery Act of 2010 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to delegate to the Regional Administrator for Region 10 of EPA such authority, and provide such additional staff, as are necessary to carry out this Act.

Requires the Administrator, acting through the Regional Administrator, to: (1) carry out the duties assigned to the Administrator under the National Estuary program as a member of the management conference; (2) assist in the development and evaluation of the priority list compiled by the Puget Sound Partnership; (3) promote methodologies and technologies that are cost-effective and able to meet the goals and objectives of the Puget Sound comprehensive conservation and management plan approved by EPA (comprehensive plan) and the EPA permitting processes; (4) coordinate the major functions of the federal government relating to the implementation of the comprehensive plan; (5) coordinate the scientific research and planning projects authorized under this Act with activities of federal and state agencies, tribes, institutions of higher learning, and the Puget Sound Partnership's Science Panel; (6) assist the Partnership in tracking progress toward meeting the identified goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan; and (7) coordinate activities, projects, programs, and studies for the protection of Puget Sound, the Strait of Georgia, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca with Canadian authorities.

Requires: (1) the identification and determination of the priority of activities, projects, programs, and studies to be made by the Partnership annually, subject to approval by the Administrator; and (2) the Administrator to compile the priority list if the Partnership fails to compile it.

Allows the Administrator, acting through the Regional Administrator, to make grants for activities, projects, programs, and studies to implement the comprehensive plan, including a comprehensive grant to the Partnership to track the implementation of the plan, monitor environmental outcomes, update the plan, and develop the annual priority list. Specifies the conditions for grant eligibility.

 Requires the President, as part of the annual budget, to submit information regarding expenditures and roles of each federal agency involved in Puget Sound protection and restoration.

Requires the Administrator and the Executive Director of the Puget Sound Partnership to a report biennially to Congress on the implementation of the comprehensive plan, any modifications to the plan during the period covered by the report, and the roles and progress of each federal agency that has jurisdiction in the Puget Sound watershed toward meeting the plan's goals and objectives.
