Authorizes the President to notify Congress within 5 days after an amendment comes into effect if the President certifies to Congress that such immediate entry into effect is important to maintain a Treaty's viability. \n\n (Sec. 6) Authorizes the President to issue regulations to implement and enforce the Treaties.\n\n(Sec. 7) States that nothing in this Act, the Treaties, or in any regulation issued to implement either Treaty shall be construed to modify or supersede any provision of law or regulation other than the AECA, as amended by this Act, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations."
