Includes as objectives of the program: (1) informing and educating the public about the risks posed by avalanches; (2) providing avalanche forecasts for avalanche-prone areas of the National Forest System that are frequented by recreational or other users; (3) providing oversight of activities relating to the prevention and control of avalanches by ski area and other special use permit holders on National Forest System land, including the procurement, control, and use of artillery; and (4) facilitating research on the program's objectives, including research on the development of alternatives to military artillery.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) use the resources of the Forest Service's National Avalanche Center and other partners; and (2) work with the Avalanche Artillery Users of North America Committee and other partners to improve coordination among the users of artillery used to prevent and control avalanches.
