Revokes the requirement that the rate of an electric loan for renewable energy be equal to the average tax-exempt municipal bond rate of similar maturities.\n\nAmends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to: (1) authorize the Secretary to make and insure loans to improve the economic and environmental climate by encouraging the development and construction of infrastructure to provide access to natural gas in rural communities; and (2) define \"natural gas\" as unmixed natural gas or any mixture of natural and artificial gas."
