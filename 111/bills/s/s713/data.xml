  <summary date="2009-11-06T22:27:48Z" status="Passed Senate amended">FEMA Accountability Act of 2009 - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to: (1) complete an assessment to determine the number of temporary housing units purchased by FEMA that it needs to maintain in stock to respond appropriately to emergencies or major disasters; and (2) establish criteria for determining whether individual temporary housing units stored by FEMA are in usable condition, including appropriate criteria for formaldehyde testing and exposure of such units.

Requires the Administrator to establish and implement a plan for: (1) storing the number of temporary housing units that the Administrator has determined that FEMA needs to maintain in stock; (2) transferring, selling, or otherwise disposing of such units in FEMA's inventory that are in excess of that number and in usable condition; and (3) disposing of such units that are determined not to be in usable condition.

Makes the plan subject to Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act disposal requirements and other applicable law.

Directs the Administrator to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of the distribution, sale, transfer, or other disposal of temporary housing units under this Act.</summary>
