Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) develop a minimum benefit standard for the provision of comprehensive maternity coverage under an individual health plan, which shall require coverage for the full scope of maternity services from preconception through postpartum; and (2) require health insurance issuers to provide data to the Secretary to monitor compliance.
