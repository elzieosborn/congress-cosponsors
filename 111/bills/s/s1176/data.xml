  <summary date="2009-08-18T21:58:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Allied Health Reinvestment Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop public service announcements to promote the allied health professions.

Requires the Secretary to award grants to promote such professions by: (1) supporting relevant state and local advertising campaigns; (2) increasing education opportunities; (3) carrying out programs that form education pipelines to facilitate the entry of students into relevant careers; (4) expanding enrollment in such programs; (5) providing education through new technologies and methods; (6) enhancing the workforce through retention programs; (7) developing retention strategies; (8) expanding area health education centers to develop models of excellence for such professionals; and (9) developing clinical education, internship, and resident programs that encourage mentoring and the development of specialties.

Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to enter into agreements to establish faculty loan funds to increase the number of qualified allied health faculty.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide scholarships to individuals seeking allied health education who agree to provide service in rural and other medically underserved areas with personnel shortages; (2) develop a system for collecting and analyzing workforce data to determine education pipeline and practitioner shortages and to project future needs for such a workforce; and (3) include allied health schools among the schools eligible to receive grants to support Centers of Excellence in health professions education for individuals from diverse communities and backgrounds.

Requires the Comptroller General to conduct an evaluation of whether this Act has demonstrably increased the number of allied health education program applicants.</summary>
