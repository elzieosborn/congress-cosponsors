Denies continued funding to a grant recipient who has an unresolved audit.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to: (1) report to the Judiciary Committees of Congress on November 1 of each year concerning the development and implementation of grants and strategies developed under this Act; (2) establish an information clearinghouse for data collected and best practices developed by grant recipients; and (3) ensure equitable distribution of grants among geographical regions and between urban and rural populations, including Indian tribes.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015. Limits expenditures for salaries and DOJ administrative expenses to 5% of funds authorized."
