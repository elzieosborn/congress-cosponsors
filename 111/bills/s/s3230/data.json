Provides that compliance with NEPA does not include consideration of: (1) the greenhouse gas emissions, or any climate change effects of those emissions, of a proposed action and alternative actions; or (2) the relationship of climate change effects to a proposed action or alternatives, including the relationship to proposal design, environmental impacts, mitigation, and adaptation measures.\n\nDeclares that this Act does not preempt or interfere with: (1) any authority to consider the climate change effects of proposed legislation or regulations specifically addressing greenhouse gas emissions; or (2) requirements to consider the potential effects of climate change on proposals for agency action during planning or design processes under provisions of law other than NEPA."
