  <summary date="2010-06-03T17:00:43Z" status="Introduced in Senate">NEPA Certainty Act - Declares that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) should not be used to document, predict, or mitigate the climate effects of specific federal actions. Provides that compliance with NEPA does not include consideration of: (1) the greenhouse gas emissions, or any climate change effects of those emissions, of a proposed action and alternative actions; or (2) the relationship of climate change effects to a proposed action or alternatives, including the relationship to proposal design, environmental impacts, mitigation, and adaptation measures.

Declares that this Act does not preempt or interfere with: (1) any authority to consider the climate change effects of proposed legislation or regulations specifically addressing greenhouse gas emissions; or (2) requirements to consider the potential effects of climate change on proposals for agency action during planning or design processes under provisions of law other than NEPA.</summary>
