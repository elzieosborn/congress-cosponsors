Defines "maltreated infant or toddler" as any child three years of age or younger who is the victim of a substantiated case of physical abuse, neglect, medical neglect, sexual abuse, or emotional abuse.

Directs the Administrator to award a grant to establish a National Court Teams for Maltreated Infants and Toddlers Resource Center to provide information, training, and other assistance to local court teams and to establish a uniform data collection system related to the operation and outcomes of projects initiated by such teams.

Sets forth required activities for local court teams, including: (1) conducting monthly reviews of cases handled by such teams; (2) incorporating child-focused services into case plans for maltreated infants and toddlers; (3) organizing training of community members working with court teams; (4) identifying areas for improvement in providing mental health and substance abuse treatment for families; and (5) prioritizing after-care services for families.</summary>
