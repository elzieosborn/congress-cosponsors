(Current law defines such term as a person or entity that has obtained a compulsory license under specified provisions to make eligible nonsubscription transmissions and ephemeral recordings.)\n\nTerminates, 30 days after enactment of this Act, the authority to make commercial or noncommercial webcasting settlements under existing provisions."
