Outlines additional requirements relating to renewals of such contracts.\n\nAuthorizes specified congressional access to contracts and task orders in excess of $5 million entered into by the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State, the Department of the Interior, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) during the period beginning October 1, 2001, and ending on the last day of the month during which this Act is enacted for work to be performed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nRequires certain reports to Congress regarding contracts for the performance of work in Iraq and Afghanistan."
