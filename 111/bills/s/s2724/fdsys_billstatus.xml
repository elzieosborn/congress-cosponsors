Requires the list to be revised every four years or on a finding of compelling need justifying a priority shift.</p> <p>Requires the Director, within 60 days of this Act's enactment, to deploy strategies that meet or exceed specified criteria for preventing the introduction of aquatic invasive species into the Basin and that apply to all watercraft to be launched on water within the Basin. Authorizes the Director to certify state agencies to perform decontamination activities at locations outside the Basin if standards at the sites meet or exceed standards for similar sites in the Basin. Authorizes the strategies and criteria to be modified if the Secretary of the Interior issues a determination that alternative measures will be no less effective at preventing the introduction of aquatic invasive species into Lake Tahoe. Authorizes the Director to collect and spend fees for decontamination only at a level sufficient to cover the costs of operation of inspection and decontamination stations. Sets forth civil penalties for launching watercraft not in compliance with such strategies.</p> <p>Provides that this Act does not restrict, affect, or amend any other law or the authority of any U.S. instrumentality or any state or political subdivisions with respect to the control of invasive species.</p> <p>Authorizes the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to enter into interagency agreements with nonfederal interests in the Basin to use Lake Tahoe Partnership-Miscellaneous General Investigations funds to provide programmatic technical assistance for EIP.</p> <p>Requires the Administrator to implement a Lake Tahoe Basin Program that includes: (1) developing and updating an integrated multiagency programmatic assessment and monitoring plan to evaluate the effectiveness of EIP and the status and trends of indicators related to environmental threshold carrying capacities and to assess the impacts and risks of changing climatic conditions and invasive species; (2) producing and synthesizing scientific information necessary for the identification and refinement of environmental indicators for the Basin and the evaluation of standards and benchmarks; (3) conducting applied research, programmatic technical assessments, scientific data management, analysis, and reporting related to key management questions; (4) developing new tools and information to support objective assessments for land use and resource conditions; (5) providing support to governments in reducing pollutants that contribute to the loss of lake clarity and implementing an integrated stormwater monitoring assessment program; and (6) providing support for the development of management strategies to accommodate changing climatic conditions in the Basin.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary, Administrator, and Director to conduct public education and outreach programs, including encouraging: (1) owners of land and residences in the Basin to implement defensible space and conduct best management practices for water quality; and (2) such owners and visitors to the Basin to help prevent the introduction and proliferation of invasive species as part of the private share investment in EIP.</p> <p>Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on the status of projects authorized by this Act, expenditures to implement EIP and projects authorized under this Act, accomplishments in implementing this Act, and public education and outreach efforts undertaken to implement programs and projects authorized under this Act.</p> <p>Requires the President, as part of the annual budget, to submit information regarding each federal agency involved in EIP.</p> <p>Provides for the establishment of a grant to develop a Basin watershed strategy.</p> <p>Authorizes appropriations for such Act for a period of eight fiscal years beginning the first fiscal year after enactment of this Act.</p>]]></text>
