Permits a major rule to take effect for 90 calendar days without such approval if the President determines such rule is necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, for national security, or to implement an international trade agreement.\n\nSets forth procedures of the House of Representatives and the Senate for joint resolutions: (1) approving major rules; and (2) disapproving nonmajor rules."
