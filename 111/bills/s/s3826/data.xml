  <summary date="2010-09-30T18:24:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2010 - Rewrites provisions regarding congressional review of agency rulemaking to require congressional approval of major rules of the executive branch before they may take effect (currently, major rules take effect unless Congress passes and the President signs a joint resolution disapproving them).

Provides that if a joint resolution of approval of a major rule is not enacted by the end of 90 session days or legislative days after such resolution is introduced, the rule shall be deemed not to be approved and shall not take effect. Permits a major rule to take effect for 90 calendar days without such approval if the President determines such rule is necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, for national security, or to implement an international trade agreement.

Sets forth procedures of the House of Representatives and the Senate for joint resolutions: (1) approving major rules; and (2) disapproving nonmajor rules.</summary>
