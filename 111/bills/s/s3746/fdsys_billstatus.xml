        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPA) to prohibit federal loan guarantees for innovative technologies unless: (1) an appropriation for the cost of the guarantee has been made; (2) the Secretary of Energy (DOE) has received and deposited into the Treasury payment in full from the borrower for the cost of the guarantee; or (3) a combination of appropriations or payments from the borrower has been made that is sufficient to cover the cost of the guarantee. </p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements to provide a third-party credit report if: (1) such report, in the Secretary's opinion, is not relevant to the determination of the credit risk of a project; (2) the project costs are not projected to exceed $100 million; and (3) the applicant agrees to accept the credit rating the Secretary assigns.</p> <p>Authorizes the head of the loan guarantee program, if there is either a severe shortage of candidates or a severe hiring need for particular positions, to recruit and directly appoint into the competitive service highly qualified critical personnel with specialized knowledge important to program functions (direct hire authority).</p> <p>Amends the EPA and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to authorize the Secretary to: (1) retain agents and professional advisors in connection with guarantees and related activities; and (2) require loan guarantee applicants and recipients to pay all fees and expenses of such agents and advisors.</p>  <p>Authorizes the Secretary to make energy efficiency loan guarantees for projects starting construction by September 30, 2011, to retrofit residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, facilities, and equipment.</p>  ]]></text>
