  <summary date="2010-10-01T15:25:55Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Provides that it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any conference report or other legislation that originates in the House of Representatives, or any Senate bill or related conference report to which the House added a provision, that addresses climate change through the inclusion of a cap-and-trade program if the Senate has not considered and approved a bill addressing climate change that included such a program.

Allows such provision to be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members. Requires a two-thirds vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised on such provision.</summary>
