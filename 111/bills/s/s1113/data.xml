  <summary date="2009-07-24T20:37:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Safe Roads Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a national clearinghouse for positive alcohol and controlled substance test results and test refusals of commercial motor vehicle operators. Prohibits the release of clearinghouse information to a commercial motor carrier employer unless there has been compliance with all applicable federal privacy laws and regulations.

Authorizes the Secretary to collect fees from such employers and other authorized users for informational requests.

Prohibits an employer from hiring an individual to operate a commercial motor vehicle unless the employer has determined that the individual, for the preceding three-year period, has: (1) been tested for use of alcohol and controlled substances; (2) not tested positive for their use, or tested positive but has completed the return-to-duty process; and (3) not refused to be tested.

Directs the Secretary to establish a process: (1) to require employers to request and review any clearinghouse records of individuals before their employment as a commercial motor vehicle operator; and (2) for an individual and a state licensing authority to request and receive information from the clearinghouse.

Subjects persons who violate the requirements of this Act to both civil and criminal penalties.



Requires the Secretary to take certain actions to enhance Department of Transportation (DOT) oversight of testing sites.</summary>
