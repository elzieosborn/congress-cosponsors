    "text": "Promoting Electric Vehicles Act of 2010 - Title I: National Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Deployment Program - (Sec. 101) Establishes within the Department of Energy (DOE) a national plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment program.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy to: (1) provide, upon local request, technical assistance to state, local, and tribal governments with the deployment of plug-in electric drive vehicles; (2) make available to the public information regarding the cost, performance, usage data, and technical data regarding plug-in electric drive vehicles and associated infrastructure; (3) carry out a national assessment and develop a national plan for plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment; and (4) award grants to state, local, and tribal governments or government-private partnerships to assist them in preparing a community deployment plan and in preparing and implementing programs that support the such deployment.\n\nDirects the Secretary, in consultation with the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, the International Code Council, and any other organizations determined to be appropriate, to develop and publish guidance for: (1) model building codes for the inclusion of separate circuits for charging infrastructure in new construction and major renovations of private residences, buildings, or other structures; (2) model construction permitting or inspection processes that allow for the expedited installation of charging infrastructure for purchasers of plug-in electric drive vehicles; and (3) model zoning, parking rules, or other local ordinances that facilitate the installation of, and access to, charging infrastructure.\n\n (Sec. 104) Requires the Secretary to award grants to educational institutions to provide training and education for vocational workforce development to ensure skills needed to work on and maintain plug-in electric drive vehicles and the infrastructure required to support them.\n\n(Sec. 105) Directs the Federal Energy Management Program and the General Services Administration (GSA) to assess and report to Congress on federal government fleets with respect to conversion to plug-in electric drive vehicles. Requires each agency of the federal government to include plug-in electric drive vehicle purchases identified pursuant to this Act in the budget of the agency to be included in the budget submitted by the President.\n\nInstructs the Administrator of General Services to acquire plug-in electric drive vehicles and the requisite charging infrastructure to be deployed in a range of locations in federal fleets, which may include the U.S. Postal Service and Department of Defense (DOD), during a five-year period.\n\nAmends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to direct the Secretary to prioritize the acquisition of plug-in electric drive vehicles over nonelectric alternative fueled vehicles.\n\n(Sec. 106) Establishes within the national deployment program a targeted plug-in electric drive vehicle deployment communities program.\n\nTitle II: Research and Development - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a program to fund research and development in advanced batteries, plug-in electric drive vehicle components, plug-in electric drive infrastructure, and related technologies; (2) implement a study on recycling of materials from plug-in electric drive vehicles and their batteries; and (3) establish the Advanced Batteries for Tomorrow Prize for development of a 500-mile vehicle battery. Establishes in the Treasury the 500-mile Battery Fund.\n\n(Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to Congress on the raw materials needed for the manufacture of components for plug-in electric drive vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support such vehicles.\n\n(Sec. 204) Directs the Secretary of Energy to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for a study of the data that may be collected from plug-in electric drive vehicles.\n\nTitle III: Miscellaneous - (Sec. 301) Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to require each electric utility to develop a plan to support the use of plug-in electric drive vehicles in its service area.\n\nRequires the Secretary, in consultation with the the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Technical Advisory Committee established by this Act, to convene a group of utility stakeholders, charging infrastructure providers, third party aggregators, and others to discuss and determine the potential models for the challenging issues involved in using electricity as a fuel for vehicles.\n\n(Sec. 302) Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to direct the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans to eligible entities for the aggregate purchase of not fewer than 200 qualified automotive batteries (designed for use in qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles but purchased for nonautomotive applications) in a calendar year with a total minimum power rating of one megawatt and advanced battery technology.\n\nAmends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to authorize the Secretary to make guarantees for charging infrastructure and networks of charging infrastructure for plug-in drive electric vehicles, if the infrastructure will be operational prior to December 31, 2016.\n\n(Sec. 303) Requires disposal of an advanced battery from a plug-in electric drive vehicle in accordance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n\n(Sec. 305) Directs the President to establish the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Interagency Task Force."
