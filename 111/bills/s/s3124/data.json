    "text": "Healthy Living Starts Early Act of 2010 - Amends the child and adult care food program of the the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to: (1) require subsidized food served to children in child care centers and day care homes to meet the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans and certain authoritative scientific recommendations; (2) prohibit such food from being used as a punishment or reward; (3) allow nondairy substitutes to be served to children who cannot consume milk, provided the substitutes are nutritionally equivalent to milk and meet certain nutritional standards; (4) require the use of foods, to the extent practicable, that are in abundance nationally or in the food service area, or are donated by the Secretary of Agriculture; (5) require the Secretary to encourage participants to provide children with daily opportunities for age-appropriate moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity and limit children's use of electronic media; and (6) require the Secretary to provide technical assistance and guidance to participants in complying with these requirements.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to encourage states to include nutrition and wellness within their licensing standards for such facilities; and (2) conduct recurring, nationally representative assessments of facility nutrition and wellness programs.\n\nRequires the Secretary to reconvene a working group to examine, and report to Congress regarding, the feasibility of reducing the paperwork burden on states and program participants.\n\nRequires institutions participating in the program to enter into a permanent agreement with their state that may be terminated for convenience or cause.\n\nAlters program application and review requirements, eliminating the three-year reapplication process and scheduled annual site visits.\n\nAllows Tier II day care homes (those not located in low-income areas or operated by low-income providers) to assist in the transmission, with parental consent, of household income information to their sponsoring organizations.\n\nSets forth an administrative costs reimbursement formula for day care home sponsoring organizations."
