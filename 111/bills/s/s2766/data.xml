Provides for similar coverage under the TRICARE program (military health care).

Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to provide coverage in group and individual plans of such food and vitamins and amino acids.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to determine the minimum yearly coverage for all health insurance plans based upon the expanded coverage provided by this Act.</summary>
