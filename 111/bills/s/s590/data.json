Authorizes such Secretary to so contract using procedures other than competitive procedures, under certain conditions and after congressional notification.\n\nAmends the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 to extend through FY2020 a pilot program for the purchase of certain municipal services for military installations.\n\nAmends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 to broaden the indemnification provided to transferees of military properties.\n\nReinstates provisions of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 which allow military departments to transfer surplus real and personal property at closed or realigned military installations without consideration to local redevelopment authorities when used for economic development purposes, without the requirement to assess the property's value."
