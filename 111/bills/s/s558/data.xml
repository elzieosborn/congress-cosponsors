Requires the labeling of a standard food item served or offered for sale in a food service establishment that is part of a chain that operates 20 or more establishments under the same trade name to disclose, in a clear and conspicuous manner, prior to the point of purchase: (1) the number of calories on a menu board, on a sign meeting certain requirements, in the menu, or as part of or supplement to the menu; (2) specified nutrient information, in writing and upon request; (3) a statement directing the consumer to the availability of additional nutrient information; and (4) a statement providing suggested daily caloric intake, on a menu or menu board that does not list calories.

Declares a person to have knowingly or willfully violated the requirements of this Act if the person: (1) purposefully fails to make a disclosure required by this Act; or (2) makes a disclosure with the intent to deceive.

Provides that a reasonable basis determination of nutrition information shall be required only once per standard food item if certain requirements are met.

Preempts state laws not identical to this Act.</summary>
