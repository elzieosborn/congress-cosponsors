Requires the Comptroller General to study and report annually to Congress on changes to payment policies under the Medicare program as a result of the amendments made by this Act.

Authorizes MedPAC to advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), on priorities for health services research.

Directs MedPAC to establish: (1) an office of ombudsman to handle complaints on the implementation of certain regulations; and (2) a council of health and economic advisers to advise it on its development, analyses, and implementation of payment policies.

Establishes: (1) a consumer advisory council to advise MedPAC on the impact of Medicare payment policies on consumers; and (2) a federal health advisory council.</summary>
