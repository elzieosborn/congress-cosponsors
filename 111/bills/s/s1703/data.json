(This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that the Secretary of the Interior could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction when the Act was enacted.)\n\nMakes such amendments retroactive as if included in the Indian Reorganization Act as of the date of its enactment on June 18, 1934.\n\nProvides that this Act does not affect any law other than the Indian Reorganization Act or limit the Secretary of the Interior's authority under any federal law or regulation other than the Indian Reorganization Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary to conduct and submit to Congress a study that: (1) describes the Carcieri decision's effect on Indian tribes and tribal land; and (2) includes a list of each affected Indian tribe and parcel of tribal land."
