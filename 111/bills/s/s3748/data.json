Allows such request to be denied only for medical or personal safety reasons.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide each member so retained (and, as practicable, appropriate family members) reintegration counseling and services.\n\nProvides FY2011 funding for costs of such additional active-duty retention."
