  <summary date="2010-01-08T17:58:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Military Voter Compliant States Act of 2009 - Amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act to exempt certain states from the requirement that a state transmit a validly requested absentee ballot to an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter not later than 45 days before a federal election if the voter's request is received at least 45 days before the election.

Requires a waiver of such requirement for any state where, in the regularly scheduled general election for federal office held in November 2008, less than 3% of all absentee ballots received by the state from absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters were not counted as a result of not being received in time to be so counted.</summary>
