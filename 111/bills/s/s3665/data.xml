Pakistani-American Enterprise Fund Act - Authorizes the President to designate a private, nonprofit organization based in Pakistan (the Pakistani-American Enterprise Fund) to receive funds and support to promote and strengthen the private sector in Pakistan.

States that the grant agreement between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Fund shall require the Fund to: (1) liquidate its assets and dissolve not later than December 31, 2020, unless USAID determines after congressional consultation that the Fund should be extended; and (2) prevent funds from being used for money laundering and terrorist financing.

Requires: (1) an annual Fund report to Congress; and (2) a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report to Congress every three years regarding Fund activities.

Urges the Fund's Board of Directors to adopt the best practices and procedures used by Enterprise Funds, including those for which funding has been made available pursuant to the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989.</summary>
