    "text": "Managing Arson Through Criminal History (MATCH) Act of 2010 - Directs the Attorney General to maintain at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) a national database for each criminal arsonist or bomber (an individual convicted of an arson or bombing offense), to be known as the National Criminal Arsonist and Criminal Bomber Registry. Limits the use of such Registry and disclosures therefrom to law enforcement purposes.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to: (1) ensure that updated information about a criminal arsonist or bomber is immediately available to all relevant jurisdictions (i.e., states, the District of Columbia, territories and possessions, and federally recognized Indian tribes); (2) provide notification to a jurisdiction in which the criminal arsonist or bomber is an employee, a student, or a resident; (3) establish and maintain a national arsonist and bomber Internet site which includes relevant information for each criminal arsonist or bomber; (4) establish guidelines for correction of erroneous information in the Registry or Internet site; and (5) develop and support software to enable jurisdictions to participate in the Registry and Internet site. Prohibits access by the public to information in the Registry or on the Internet site.\n\nSets forth the information required to be included in the Registry by the arsonist or bomber and by jurisdictions, including identifying information, physical descriptions, photographs, and fingerprints. Allows expungement of information from the Registry for juveniles after five years. Requires notification to criminal arsonists and bombers of registration requirements and the duty to register.\n\nRequires jurisdictions to participate in the Registry before the later of three years after the enactment of this Act or one year after software provided by the Attorney General is made available to such jurisdictions. Allows federally recognized Indian tribes to elect to participate in the Registry.\n\nGrants the federal government and jurisdictions immunity from liability for good faith conduct under this Act.\n\nAmends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to provide additional grant funding to assist states in implementing this Act."
