Makes participation by a firm that sells to a state or local government through such schedule voluntary. Requires the Administrator, for authorized nonfederal users of federal supply schedules, to: (1) review the existing ordering guidance and, as necessary, prescribe additional guidance to ensure proper usage and to maximize task and delivery order competition; (2) make available the online electronic Request for Quote/Request for Proposal system; and (3) make available, free of charge, training related to proper schedule usage, including online training courses.</p> <p>Requires the OMB Director to issue guidance to ensure accurate and consistent reporting of "jobs created" and "jobs retained" as those terms are used in such Act.</p> <p>Amends the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to require OMB to ensure that the federal awards website established under such Act: (1) clearly differentiates between projects funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and other federal awards; and (2) provides users with the ability to perform searches for information in the website relating only to amounts funded by ARRA. Requires the website Recovery.gov (established under ARRA) to prominently display a link to the federal awards website on its front page.</p>]]></text>
