  <summary date="2010-06-14T15:40:46Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Health Insurance Rate Authority Act of 2010 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a uniform process for the review of potentially unreasonable increases in rates for health insurance coverage, which shall include premiums.

Directs the Secretary to establish a Health Insurance Rate Authority to advise and make recommendations to the Secretary.

Sets forth corrective actions for unreasonable increases in rates.

Requires a report on state authority to review rates and take corrective action, rating requests received by the state and actions taken, justifications by insurance issuers for rate requests, and a recommended definition of unreasonable rate increase. Requires the Secretary to determine: (1) for which states the state insurance commissioner will review rate increases and take corrective action; and (2) for which states the Secretary will undertake such actions based on the Secretary's determination that such states lack the authority and capability.

Directs the Secretary to develop a uniform data collection system for new and increased rate information.

Requires the Authority to produce annually a single, aggregate report on insurance market behavior.

Directs states, as a condition of receiving a grant under this Act, to provide the Secretary with information about trends in rate increases in health insurance coverage in premium rating areas in the state.

Requires the Secretary to carry out a program to award grants to states to carry out this Act.

Authorizes the Secretary to enforce this Act if the state does not substantially enforce the provisions. Establishes civil penalties for violations.</summary>
