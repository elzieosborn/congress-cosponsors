    "text": "POPs, LRTAP POPs, and PIC Implementation Act of 2009 - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to incorporate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) provisions from: (1) the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs Convention); (2) the Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants to the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP POPs Protocol); and (3) the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (PIC Convention). Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to participate in activities supporting implementation of such agreements.\n\nProhibits the sale, distribution, use, production, or disposal of aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dieldrin, endrin, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, hexabromobiphenyl, mirex, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), toxaphene, and other specified chemicals in a manner that is inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the POPs Convention or the LRTAP POPs Protocol.\n\nRequires the Administrator to publish notice and specified reports and provide the public an opportunity to comment on certain POPs Convention and LRTAP POPs Protocol proposals, risk profiles, decisions, and recommendations.\n\nRequires any person distributing certain chemical substances or mixtures included in the PIC Convention to comply with export conditions and notification requirements. Requires pesticides or active ingredients that are subject to certain notice requirements under the PIC Convention to have certain labeling information, safety data sheets, and documentation of customs codes assigned by the World Customs Organization.\n\nDirects the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to notify the public about PIC Convention decisions to list pesticides and any foreign state's conditions or restrictions a applicable to the importation of the pesticide from the United States.\n\nDirects the Administrator to apply the more stringent of conflicting provisions between the POPs Convention and: (1) the LRTAP POPs Protocol; or (2) the PIC Convention."
