Sets forth minimum requirements for such standards concerning: (1) an infectious agent control plan in settings where health care is delivered; (2) personal protective equipment; (3) training and information, including providing job-specific training and education regarding the prevention of transmission of infectious agents and providing instructional materials for patients and visitors; and (4) medical surveillance for exposed workers.</summary>
