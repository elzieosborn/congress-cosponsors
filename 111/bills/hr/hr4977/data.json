    "text": "Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 to eliminate the requirement that Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship recipients perform their teaching obligation in high-need local educational agencies (LEAs). (The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program provides grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to recruit and train mathematics and science teachers for elementary and secondary schools.)\n\nReduces the teaching obligation of scholarship recipients by one year if they perform their obligation in high-need LEAs. Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish and maintain a central information clearinghouse on teaching opportunities in high-need LEAs.\n\nRequires IHEs to provide, from nonfederal sources, an amount equal to 30% of their grant to carry out the program."
