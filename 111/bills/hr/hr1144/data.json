Requires transmission of a copy of such policy to specified congressional committees.\n\nRequires federal science agencies to collect specified standardized annual data for all applications for research and development grants to institutions of higher education and to submit the data collected to the National Science Foundation (NSF). Makes the NSF responsible for storing and publishing all such grant data.\n\nRequires annual publication of a list of the institutions of higher education science and engineering departments represented by individuals who attend the workshops described above."
