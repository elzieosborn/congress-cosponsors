Requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to enforce such disclosure restrictions and to destroy fingerprints and criminal history records after any transaction based upon such fingerprints or records is completed.\n\nAmends the PROTECT Act to provide for an extension of the Child Safety Pilot Program."
