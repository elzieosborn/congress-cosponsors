  <summary date="2009-05-23T16:37:29Z" status="Passed House amended">Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to study and report to the Secretary of Homeland Security and specified congressional committees on the functions and capabilities of the Civil Air Patrol to support the homeland security missions of state, local, and tribal governments and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Requires the Comptroller General to review the process by which the Civil Air Patrol may provide assistance to the Secretary, other federal agencies, and states to support homeland security missions, including by providing: (1) aerial reconnaissance or communications capabilities for border security; (2) capabilities for collective response to an act of terrorism, natural disaster, or other man-made event by assisting in damage assessment and situational awareness, conducting search and rescue operations, assisting in evacuations, or transporting time-sensitive medical or other materials; or (3) assistance in the exercise and training of departmental resources responsible for the intercept of aviation threats to designated restricted areas.

Directs the Comptroller General's report to include assessments of: (1) the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using Civil Air Patrol assets; and (2) whether current mechanisms for requesting support from the Civil Air Patrol are sufficient.

Requires the Secretary to analyze the study and report to the committees any recommendations for action that could affect DHS's organization and administration.</summary>
