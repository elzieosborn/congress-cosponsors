Russell National School Lunch Act to allow local educational agencies (LEAs) to revise previously submitted meal claims to approve children retroactively for up to 90 days for free or reduced price meals under the school lunch program.\n\nRequires children who are eligible for free meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs to be provided the meal that is provided on any given day, regardless of unpaid fees.\n\nRequires children who are eligible for reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs to be provided the meal that is provided on any given day, as long as the child pays the reduced-price meal fee that day, regardless of unpaid fees.\n\nDirects LEAs that wish to implement a substitute meal policy for children with unpaid school meal fees to ensure that it doesn't stigmatize the children.\n\nRequires LEAs to directly certify children who owe at least a week of meal fees as eligible for free meals or provide their households with the materials and encouragement to apply for such meals.\n\nProhibits LEAs attempting to collect unpaid school meal fees from a household from taking any action directed at the household's child or using a debt collector."
