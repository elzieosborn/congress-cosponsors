Requires the Secretary, the Director of the Community Services Administration (with respect to community action agencies), and the Comptroller General of the United States to have access to such records.\n\nRequires the annual report by the Secretary and the Director to the President and Congress on such program to include any findings, determinations, and recommendations of the Secretary regarding such impediments."
