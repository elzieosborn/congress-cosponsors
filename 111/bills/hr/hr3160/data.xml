Conditions the availability of: (1) FY2010 appropriations for a voluntary contribution to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) upon a determination by the Secretary of State that Israel is not being denied IAEA participation; and (2) certain appropriations to support a Palestinian state upon a determination by the Secretary that the Palestinian governing entity has demonstrated a commitment to peaceful co-existence with Israel and is taking appropriate counterterrorism measures.

Expresses the sense of Congress against the Arab League boycott of Israel.

Prohibits the expenditure of specified funds to create in any part of Jerusalem a new government office of any U.S. department or agency for the purpose of conducting official U.S. business with the Palestinian Authority (PA) or successor governing entity over Gaza and Jericho.</summary>
