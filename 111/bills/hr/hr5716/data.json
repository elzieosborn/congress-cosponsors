    "text": "Safer Oil and Natural Gas Drilling Technology Research and Development Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to direct the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to implement a deepwater (in lieu of ultra-deepwater) technologies research and development program, which shall: (1) address technology challenges for well control and accident prevention; and (2) implement research supportive of such activities through DOE and the Office of Fossil Energy. Revises the petroleum resources research and development program to replace ultra-deepwater activities with deepwater architecture, well control and accident prevention, and deepwater technology. Extends the program to drilling in all waters greater than 1,000 feet (currently, limited to only those waters greater than 15,000 feet).\n\nDirects the Secretary to advance safe and environmentally responsible exploration, development, and production of natural gas and petroleum resources.\n\nModifies the focus areas for awards to include: (1) specified aspects of deepwater resources; (2) expanded unconventional onshore resources; (3) consortia of small producers; and (4) safety, accident prevention, and mitigation research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities.\n\nRenames the Ultra-Deepwater Advisory Committee as the Program Advisory Committee.\n\nRenames the Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Research Fund as the Safer Oil and Natural Gas Drilling Technology Research and Development Fund. Revises the formula for Fund allocations."
