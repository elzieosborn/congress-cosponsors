  <summary date="2009-08-05T15:55:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Securing Cabin Baggage Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) (TSA), to issue regulations to limit: (1) the size of baggage and personal items carried on board a passenger aircraft; and (2) a passenger to only one carry-on bag and one personal item.

Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify certain federal regulations regarding carry-on baggage to require air carrier carry-on baggage programs to limit each passenger boarding an aircraft to one piece of carry-on baggage and one personal item. Authorizes air carriers to establish smaller size limitations for such items. Specifies items and persons to be excluded from TSA and FAA carry-on baggage limitations, including cockpit and cabin crew in uniform.

Requires the TSA and FAA to notify passengers via their websites of federal carry-on baggage and personal item limitations.

Requires the TSA to: (1) to install a template with a maximum depth and width to prevent the conveyor belt passage at each checkpoint of carry-on baggage or personal items that exceed federal size limitations; and (2) require passengers with carry-on baggage or personal items that exceed such limitations to check them in.</summary>
