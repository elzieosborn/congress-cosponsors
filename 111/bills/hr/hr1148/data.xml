  <summary date="2009-03-25T21:34:31Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) conduct in the maritime environment a program for the mobile biometric identification of suspected individuals, including terrorists, to enhance border security and for other purposes; (2) ensure such program's coordination with other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) biometric identification programs; and (3) submit to the appropriate congressional committees an analysis of the cost of expanding DHS biometric identification capabilities for use by departmental maritime assets, which may include a deployment plan that gives priority to vessels and units more likely to encounter individuals suspected of making unlawful border crossings through the maritime environment.

Defines "biometric identification" as the use of fingerprint and digital photography images.</summary>
