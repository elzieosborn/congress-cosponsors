Treats as a person qualified to furnish kidney disease education services an RDF meeting specified criteria.\n\nMakes eligible to participate in a shared savings program as an accountable care organization (ACO) a group consisting of RDFs, nephrologists, and other service providers and suppliers that treat patients with kidney disease.\n\nPrescribes Medicare requirements for coordination of care between hospitals and RDFs for the discharge planning process for an ESRD patient.\n\nSpecifies Medicare coverage to specialized occlusive dressings used by a patient receiving dialysis treatment for protection against life threatening catheter-related infections during maintenance of personal hygiene at home.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to evaluate and report to Congress on the transportation barriers facing dialysis patients that result in less than 100% compliance with a Medicare plan of care.\n\nDirects the Secretary, in specified circumstances, to accept the results of a state licensure survey for purposes of determining federal certification of an RDF's compliance with the conditions of Medicare participation.\n\nDirects the Secretary of HHS to report to Congress on the benefits of recognizing dialysis vascular and peritoneal dialysis access care service sites in order to receive Medicare reimbursement.\n\nRevises Medicare requirements for group health plans to: (1) extend the period during which they are primary payers (and Medicare the secondary payer) for ESRD patients; and (2) prohibit denial of a Medigap policy to a ESRD patient.\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to allow a group health plan or health insurance issuer to impose restrictions for kidney failure treatment on a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee only if they are reasonable and assure adequate access to out-of-network providers."
