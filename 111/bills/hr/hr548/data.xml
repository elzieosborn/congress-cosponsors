  <summary date="2009-03-10T15:19:19Z" status="Passed House amended">Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the American Battlefield Protection Program, to assist and work in partnership with citizens, federal, state, local, and tribal governments, other public entities, educational institutions, and private nonprofits in the identification, research, evaluation, interpretation, and protection of historic battlefields and associated sites.

Establishes a battlefield acquisition grant program under which the Secretary may provide grants to eligible entities (states and local governments) to pay the federal share of the cost to acquire interests in eligible sites for the preservation and protection of those sites. Permits an eligible entity to acquire an interest in an eligible site using a grant in partnership with a nonprofit. Requires the non-federal share to be at least 50%.



Limits acquisitions of land and interests under this Act to acquisitions of conservation easements and fee-simple purchases of eligible sites from willing sellers only.

Authorizes appropriations.

Repeals this Act on September 30, 2019.</summary>
