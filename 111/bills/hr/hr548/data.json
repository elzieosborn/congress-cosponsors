Permits an eligible entity to acquire an interest in an eligible site using a grant in partnership with a nonprofit. Requires the non-federal share to be at least 50%.\n\n\n\nLimits acquisitions of land and interests under this Act to acquisitions of conservation easements and fee-simple purchases of eligible sites from willing sellers only.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations.\n\nRepeals this Act on September 30, 2019."
