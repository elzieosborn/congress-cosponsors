  <summary date="2010-06-01T19:02:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Consumers Have Options for Molar Protection Act of 2009 or the CHOMP Act of 2009 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a dentist: (1) before performing any dental restoration work, to provide the patient with a fact sheet developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and obtain the patient's signature acknowledging receipt of that sheet; and (2) to place a copy of the signed acknowledgment in the patient's record.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and periodically review and update, as scientifically warranted, such fact sheet, describing and comparing the risks and efficacy of the various types of dental restorative materials that may be used to repair a patient's oral condition or defect; and (2) make the fact sheet available to all licensed dentists in the United States.

Establishes a $5,000 fine for violations, with the number of violations calculated by multiplying $5,000 by the number of restorative materials placed into a patient's mouth in violation of this Act.

Requires the Secretary, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to develop text describing the health risks associated with dental restorative material, to be included in its labeling. Considers such material to be misbranded if its labeling fails to include such text.</summary>
