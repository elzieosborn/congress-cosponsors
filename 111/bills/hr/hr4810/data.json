Directs the Secretary to make such payments quarterly, while requiring quarterly statements from recipients on amounts expended.\n\nRequires the Secretary to ensure that each VA medical center that provides treatment and services under the supported housing program of the United States Housing Act of 1937 employs or provides one or more specialists to handle program issues and to conduct outreach to landlords to encourage and facilitate program participation. Directs the Secretary to coordinate with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide assistance to homeless veterans in accessing HUD's Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2012 and thereafter for VA financial assistance for supportive services for very low-income veteran families occupying permanent housing.\n\nAuthorizes, in connection with VA authority to advertise in the national media concerning available VA benefits, a special emphasis to be placed on promoting awareness of assistance for homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children."
