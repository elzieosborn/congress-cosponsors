    "text": "Delaware River Basin Conservation Act of 2010 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to establish a Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, under which the Director shall: (1) work in consultation with existing management structures to identify, prioritize, and implement restoration and protection activities within the Delaware Basin (defined as including all of Delaware Bay and portions of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania located in the Delaware River watershed); (2) adopt a single plan that includes a shared set of priorities for implementation of the Program; (3) establish the Delaware River Basin Restoration Grant Program; and (4) provide technical assistance to other federal agencies, state and local governments, nonprofit and community organizations, universities, and others to carry out the Restoration Program.\n\n Requires the Grant Program to provide competitive matching grants to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, community organizations, universities, and others to carry out Restoration Program purposes. Requires the Director to develop criteria to ensure that funded activities: (1) restore or protect fish and wildlife species and their habitats; (2) improve or protect water quality by reducing nonpoint and point source pollutants; (3) reduce or improve management of water volume and flooding; (4) address priority needs or actions identified in the single plan adopted; and/or (5) include activities with multiple benefits in the Basin, including habitat, water quality, and flood protection. Limits the federal share of the total cost of a funded project to 75%. Authorizes the Director to contract with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation or another organization with the expertise to manage the Grant Program."
