  <summary date="2010-04-20T15:16:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Terrorist Notification Act of 2010 - Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to direct the head of an element of the intelligence community (IC) to provide to the Secretary of Defense any intelligence information obtained by such IC element that indicates that a member of the Armed Forces, a civilian employee of the Department of Defense (DOD), or a DOD contractor employee has communicated with a person that seeks to harm the United States or U.S. interests. Allows an exception when the IC head determines that providing such information would negatively affect an ongoing investigation.

Requires: (1) the Secretary to prescribe a process for expediting an official response to any information submitted, and to seek to achieve such response within 24 hours after receipt of the information; (2) such response to include whether the contact of the member or employee with such a person is directly related to his or her duties; (3) the Secretary to annually review and revise the response process as necessary; and (4) the Secretary to report annually to Congress concerning the instances in which such information was provided and the response to the information.</summary>
