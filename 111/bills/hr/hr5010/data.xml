  <summary date="2010-05-26T19:53:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Requires at least 10% of funds made available for high-speed rail corridor planning and development projects to be expended through small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (disadvantaged business enterprises). Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, however, if this requirement will prevent the satisfactory completion of a project because of a lack of competitive bids by disadvantaged business enterprises, to reduce the percentage for the project to the extent necessary to ensure its satisfactory completion.

Requires the Secretary to establish minimum uniform criteria for recipients of high-speed rail corridor project funds to use in certifying small business concerns as disadvantaged business enterprises.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the federal government should continue to encourage participation by veteran-owned small businesses in federal contracting and procurement opportunities and federally-funded projects, including the small business programs of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and other federal agencies.</summary>
