  <summary date="2010-07-15T19:50:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Flint Hills Preservation Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to require states and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in determining whether an exceedance or violation of a national ambient air quality standard has occurred with respect to a specific air pollutant, to exclude data from a particular air quality monitoring location if emissions from prescribed fires in the Flint Hills Region cause a concentration of the air pollutant at the location to be in excess of the standard.

Prohibits, if such emission data is excluded: (1) the Administrator from finding that a state has failed to enforce, or that a person has violated, a state implementation plan (SIP) for national primary or secondary ambient air quality standards as a result of such emissions; or (2) a state from finding that a person has violated, or from bringing an enforcement action for violation of, a SIP for such standards as a result of such emissions.

Prohibits: (1) the Administrator from requiring, or a state from adopting, a smoke management plan under such Act in connection with any prescribed fire in such region; and (2) a building, structure, facility, or installation from being treated as a stationary source under new stationary source performance standards as a result of such prescribed fires.

Provides that no person shall be required to obtain or modify an operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act in connection with such a prescribed fire.</summary>
