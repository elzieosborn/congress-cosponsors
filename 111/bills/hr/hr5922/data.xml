  <summary date="2010-09-22T19:08:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Small-Scale Hydropower Enhancement Act of 2010 - Waives certain restrictive Federal Power Act exemption qualifications for any proposed hydroelectric project that seeks to use a conduit in existence on the date of the enactment of this Act to generate power that does not exceed 1.5 megawatts.

Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) include structures that have less than 10 feet of head or would result in less than 1 megawatt of capacity as part of a certain study and report required under the Energy Policy Act of 2005; (2) consult with nonfederal and noncontracting interests in implementing this requirement; and (3) implement this requirement on a nonreimbursable basis.</summary>
