Requires each agency awarding a covered contract: (1) for a contingency operation, to prescribe minimum standards for contract personnel, including hiring, training, and equipment standards; and (2) to issue guidance on equipment used for private security functions. Requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to designate a Theater Security Contract Coordinating Officer for each contingency operation with respect to which covered contracts are awarded.\n\nRequires the Secretary of State to work through appropriate existing or new international fora to achieve agreement on an international framework regulating the use of private contractors for security functions and facilitating cooperation on measures to ensure the transparency and legal accountability of security contractors."
