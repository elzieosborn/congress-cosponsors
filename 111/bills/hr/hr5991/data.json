Prohibits the Administrator from charging any loan fees.\n\nMakes specified funds available to the Secretary of the Treasury for the loan program. Limits each loan to a maximum of $3 million and 18 months, without interest.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a small metalworking business tax credit of 30% of the amount paid or incurred for metal parts, components, or assemblies produced for the taxpayer under a contract between the taxpayer and a small metalworking business."
