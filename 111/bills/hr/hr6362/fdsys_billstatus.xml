        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act or the SAVE Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require states to allow a student who is attending a public school that does not have a safe climate for academic achievement, or who becomes a victim of a violent criminal offense while on school grounds, at a school event, or on a school bus to transfer to a safe public school within the school district. (Currently, the school must be persistently dangerous and the offense must occur on school grounds.)</p> <p>Requires states to: (1) permit schools to provide counseling and educational services to violent offenders in alternative settings; (2) require schools that know a violent offender is returning to school to notify the victim's parents that the offender is returning; and (3) provide school students, families, and staff with an annual report containing certain school crime statistics.</p> <p>Requires a state's determination that a school is unsafe to: (1) be based on those school crime statistics and certain other school data that the state is to collect; (2) be relayed to local educational agencies (LEAs) so that LEAs can relay such information to parents in a timely manner; and (3) result in ameliorative efforts by unsafe schools.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) make school crime statistics publicly available; and (2) publish a handbook to assist states and LEAs in meeting this Act's school crime, offense, and incident disclosure requirements.</p> <p>Amends the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program to augment the information LEAs must provide to states concerning students with guns to include incidents that do not involve a student's expulsion and school-related off-campus incidents, including those involving non-students.</p> <p>Includes bullying and cyberbullying prevention, and emergency preparedness in the federal activities required under the program.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to fund schoolwide climate surveys of students, parents, and school personnel for use in creating collaborative plans for school improvement.</p> <p>Gives funding priority to unsafe schools.</p>]]></text>
