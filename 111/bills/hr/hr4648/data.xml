Prohibits the Secretary of State from issuing a visa to any such alien or the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from admitting into the United States, or granting any type of immigration status to, any such alien.

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from paroling (i.e., admitting for a temporary period) any such alien into the United States.</summary>
