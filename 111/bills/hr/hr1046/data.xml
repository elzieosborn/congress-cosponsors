  <summary date="2009-04-30T15:19:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Children's Product Safety Enhancement and Clarification Act of 2009 - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 to exempt a children's product made solely out of fabric from provisions limiting the amount of lead in children's products.

Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), in implementing those lead limits with regard to a small business, a person who sells used goods, or a charity to: (1) work cooperatively with the entity; (2) take into account economic, administrative, or other limits on the entity's compliance ability; and (3) construe those provisions favorably to the entity.

Exempts a children's product made solely out of fabric from provisions requiring a manufacturer to certify, based on third party testing, that the product complies with an applicable children's product safety rule before importing, warehousing, or distributing the product.</summary>
