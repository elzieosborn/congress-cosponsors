  <summary date="2010-04-05T17:03:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Warriors Adapting Residences with Mortgages for Energy Renovations Act or WARMER Act - Revises current provisions permitting the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to guarantee loans for energy efficiency improvements to certain dwellings to also authorize the guarantee of loans to veterans for the construction of a new dwelling and the cost of making energy efficient improvements to the dwelling. Allows the Secretary to determine appropriate energy efficiency standards for purposes of such guaranteed loans, and to require that dwellings purchased, constructed, or improved meet such standards. Revises current provisions setting the maximum amount allowable for such a loan guaranty to set the maximum amount for such guaranty at 5% of the total value of the property, unless the Secretary specifically approves a higher amount.</summary>
