(Currently, the Attorney General is authorized to require any alien to provide a Social Security account number for inclusion in any record maintained by the Attorney General or the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services.)\n\nRequires the Commissioner of Social Security, if a Social Security account number has been used multiple times, to provide the DHS Secretary with information regarding: (1) the name, date of birth, and address of each individual who used the same Social Security account number; and (2) the name and address of the person reporting the earnings for each such individual.\n\nRequires the Commissioner to provide such information to the DHS Secretary, in an electronic form, if more than one person reports earnings for an individual during a single tax year.\n\nDirects the Commissioner, at the DHS Secretary's request and expense, to perform and report on a search or manipulation of Social Security Commission records if the Secretary certifies that the purpose is to obtain information likely to assist in identifying individuals (and their employers) who are: (1) using false names or Social Security account numbers; (2) sharing a single valid name and Social Security account number among multiple individuals; (3) using the Social Security account number of a person who is deceased, too young to work, or not authorized to work; or (4) otherwise engaged in a violation of the immigration laws.\n\nDeclares inadmissible to receive visas and to be admitted to the United States any alien who falsely represents himself or herself to be a U.S. national for any purpose or benefit under immigration and nationality or any other federal or state law."
