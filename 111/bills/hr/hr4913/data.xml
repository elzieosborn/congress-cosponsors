Requires such a claim to: (1) be stated so that it is an accurate, balanced summary of such research and enables the public to comprehend the information provided in the claim and the relative significance of such information in the context of a total daily diet; and (2) identify each party that funded research to support the claim.

Allows a disease or health-related statement for a dietary supplement if: (1) the statement claims to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent a specific disease or class of diseases, based on legitimate scientific research; (2) the manufacturer of the supplement has substantiation that such statement is truthful and not misleading; and (3) the health claim includes a citation to the research supporting such claim and identifies each party that funded such research.
