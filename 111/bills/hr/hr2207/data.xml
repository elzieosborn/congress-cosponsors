  <summary date="2009-05-18T15:41:43Z" status="Introduced in House">Interagency Cooperation Commission Act - Establishes the Interagency Cooperation Commission to examine the long-term global challenges facing the United States and develop legislative and administrative proposals to improve interagency cooperation.

Requires the Commission to: (1) address the role and impact in facilitating or impeding interagency cooperation of a variety of budgetary, planning, and operational factors; and (2) examine interdepartmental cooperation within the Department of Defense (DOD), including the common organizational structures, reference materials, and budget processes, and examine the value of such structures as models for broader government commonality.

 Lists as the subjects of required assessments: (1) past examples of successful and unsuccessful interagency cooperation; (2) the impact of the Goldwater-Nichols Act within DOD; (3) the effectiveness of current interagency structures and processes to engage in strategic planning and oversee and implement long-term United States policy in global affairs; (4) simulation-based assessments of global scenarios the United States may face in the long-term; and (5) the legal decision-making authority and resources needed in each department and at the highest levels of government to execute reforms proposed by the Commission.</summary>
