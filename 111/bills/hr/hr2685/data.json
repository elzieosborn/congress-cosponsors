    "text": "Climate and Ocean Research and Coordination Act of 2009 - Reestablishes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its leadership. (NOAA was created by the Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970.) Includes in NOAA the National Weather Service and the Science Advisory Board.\n\nNational Climate Enterprise Act of 2009 - Directs the President to establish a National Climate Enterprise to coordinate international, federal, and nonfederal activity to provide scientifically based climate and climate impact data, information, products, and services to better forecast climate, climate change, and climate variability and to understand climate impacts at regional and local scales. Requires that the Enterprise consist of an Interdepartmental Oversight Board, an Interagency Coordinating Committee, and a Climate Operations Office established by this Act, and nonfederal contributors.\n\nRequires the Office, subject to appropriations, to develop and implement a quality assurance program to certify climate products and services that satisfy this Act's standards. Defines \"climate product and service\" as any publicly or commercially available product or service produced by a nonfederal contributor that includes or displays climate data, meta-data, or information. Allows the Enterprise to authorize the use of the emblem or any trademark of the Enterprise on a certified climate product or service. Establishes in the Treasury the Climate Products And Services Account.\n\nRequires the Enterprise Advisory Board to provide advice to the Interagency Coordinating Committee on policy implementation by the Climate Operations Office, the effectiveness of data, meta-data, information, products, and services delivered to end-users, priorities for climate research and information needs, the performance of non-federal contributors, and critical climate research needs."
