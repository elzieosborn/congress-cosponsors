Prohibits the staff and personnel of corporations and partnerships (as well as any individual) primarily engaged in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution, of stocks, bonds, or other similar securities from serving simultaneously as an officer, director, or employee of any member bank. Authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to grant an exception in limited classes of cases when in the Board's judgment it would not unduly influence the investment policies of such member bank or the advice it gives its customers regarding investments.</summary>
