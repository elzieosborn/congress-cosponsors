Directs the GSA Administrator to acquire such vehicles and charging infrastructure and deploy them in a range of locations in the federal fleet.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy to establish the Advanced Batteries for Tomorrow Prize to advance research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of a 500-mile vehicle battery. Creates in the Treasury a 500-mile Battery Fund.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Energy to establish a research and development funding program for advanced batteries, plug-in electric drive vehicle components, plug-in electric drive infrastructure, and other related technologies.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to Congress on: (1) the raw materials needed for the manufacture of components for plug-in electric drive vehicles; and (2) the infrastructure needed to support such vehicles.\n\nEstablishes the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Technical Advisory Committee.\n\nDirects the President to establish the Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Interagency Task Force.\n\nRequires disposal of an advanced battery from a plug-in electric drive vehicle in accordance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n\nAmends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to direct the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans to eligible entities for the aggregate purchase of not fewer than 200 qualified automotive batteries (designed for use in qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles but purchased for nonautomotive applications) in a calendar year with a total minimum power rating of one megawatt and advanced battery technology.\n\nDirects the Secretary to develop and publish model building codes for the inclusion of separate circuits for charging infrastructure in new construction and major renovations of private residences, buildings, or other structures; (2) model construction permitting or inspection processes that allow for the expedited installation of charging infrastructure for purchasers of plug-in electric drive vehicles; and (3) model zoning, parking rules, or other local ordinances that facilitate the installation of, and access to, charging infrastructure.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for grid-interactive plug-in vehicles.\n\nDirects the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for a study of the data that may be collected from plug-in electric drive vehicles.\n\nAmends the Clean Air Act to direct the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations to establish: (1) national transportation-related goals for reducing oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) standardized models and related methods for states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and air quality agencies to address oil savings and emission reduction goals. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations concerning the consideration of oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in transportation planning.\n\nRequires metropolitan planning areas and states to develop surface transportation-related oil savings and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as well as strategies to meet those targets.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Transportation to distribute funds to states and MPOs for investing in transportation greenhouse gas emission reduction programs.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to increase to $230 the amount of qualified transportation fringe (commuter) benefits excluded from an employee's gross income.\n\nMakes it the goal of the United States to shift at least 10% of freight shipped by truck to rail or marine shipping by calendar 2020.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) develop a national freight transportation options plan; and (2) make grants to states for the capital costs of facilities, infrastructure, and equipment for high priority rail corridor projects necessary to reduce congestion in freight rail transportation.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to study and report on the benefits and costs of electrification of rail corridors.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an investment tax credit for advanced biofuel facilities as well as grants in lieu of credits for advanced biofuel facility property (under division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009).
