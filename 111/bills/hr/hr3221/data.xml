Ties increases in the maximum Pell Grant amount, beginning in 2011, to increases in the Consumer Price Index, plus 1%.

(Sec. 102) Amends part E (College Access Challenge Grant program) of title VII of the Act to create a new part E (College Access and Completion Innovation Fund) that includes the College Access Challenge Grant program, a new State Innovation and Completion Grants program, and a new Innovation in College Access and Completion National Activities Grants program.

Directs the Secretary of Education (Secretary) to award competitive matching State Innovation and Completion grants to states to: (1) implement activities and services that increase students' persistence in and completion of postsecondary school, particularly students now underrepresented at such schools; and (2) develop an interoperable statewide longitudinal data system to track students success in postsecondary schools and the workforce.

Permits states to make subgrants to nonprofit organizations in their state, including student loan guaranty agencies, to implement the program.

Gives grant priority to states that partner with philanthropic organizations or student loan guaranty agencies to implement the program.

Requires states to use at least one-third of program funding for activities benefiting students at two-year institutions of higher education (IHEs).

Directs the Secretary to award competitive Innovation in College Access and Completion National Activities grants to IHEs, states, nonprofit organizations, philanthropic organizations, and TRIO grantees for innovative programs that advance knowledge about, and the adoption of, policies and practices that increase the number of individuals with postsecondary degrees or certificates.

Includes among such programs those providing students with supplemental grant or loan benefits.

Gives grant priority to programs that: (1) serve underrepresented students; (2) are offered by IHEs that do not predominantly award bachelor's degrees; (3) increase degree or certificate completion in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; or (4) encourage constructive partnerships between IHEs with high degree completion rates and those without such rates.

Authorizes and appropriates specified funds for FY2010-FY2014 for part E programs, dedicating 25% of such funds to the College Access Challenge Grant program, 50% to the State Innovation and Completion Grants program, 23% to the Innovation in College Access and Completion National Activities Grants program, and 2% for the evaluation of such programs by the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences.

Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to IHEs that have at least 100 full-time students who are veterans so that they can hire Veterans Resource Officers to increase their veterans' college completion rates. Requires schools to give priority to hiring veterans to fill such positions.

Authorizes such sums as may be necessary for the Veterans Resource Officer Grants program for FY2010 and thereafter.

(Sec. 103) Extends funding for grants to historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions through FY2019.

Sets aside $10 million of such funds each fiscal year for YES Partnership grants, which are for use in encouraging underrepresented minority or low-income students in kindergarten through grade 12 to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through outreach and hands-on, experiential-based learning projects.

Sets such grant amount at the difference between the veterans' educational assistance such veteran receives and the amount the veteran would receive if enrolled at the public IHE that charges the highest fees in the state.

Subtitle B: Student Financial Aid Form Simplification - (Sec. 121) Makes revisions to title IV student need analyses, which become effective after June 2011.

(Sec. 122) Establishes a $150,000 asset cap on student eligibility for Pell grants, loans under the part D Direct Loan (DL) program, or work assistance under title IV.

(Sec. 210) Changes, subject to lender approval, the underlying index for calculating special allowance payments to FFEL lenders for loans first disbursed on or after January 1, 2000, and before July 1, 2010, from three-month commercial paper (CP) rates to the one-month London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). (Special allowance payments are made to FFEL lenders to compensate them for the difference between FFEL interest rates and market rates.)

Makes such change applicable to the calendar quarter beginning on October 1, 2009.

(Sec. 211) Requires DLs for students and the parents of students attending IHEs outside of this country to be disbursed through a financial institution located in this country which is designated by the Secretary to receive DL funds and transfer them to such schools.

(Sec. 214) Directs the Secretary to award DL servicing contracts pursuant to a competitive bidding process that includes nonprofit servicers and takes into account price and servicing ability. Provides that such process may take into account servicers' ability to provide default aversion and outreach services.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide job retention incentive payments to servicers that give hiring priority to individuals from locations at which the servicers performed FFEL origination or servicing activities on the date of this Act's enactment; and (2) consider servicers retention of highly qualified employees as a positive factor when determining their loan allocation.

Directs the Secretary to contract with each nonprofit servicer that has its principal place of business in a state to service the DLs of borrowers attending schools within such state, provided its services meet federal standards and are offered at competitive rates. Provides that competitive rates are to be determined by the Secretary and may take into account the volume of loans serviced by the servicer.

(The interest on unsubsidized loans accrues while the borrower is in school.)

(Sec. 224) Allocates up to $6 billion of loan authority annually among IHEs that are eligible to participate in the DL program and enter into agreements with the Secretary to make Direct Perkins Loans to eligible students.

Allocates loan authority to eligible IHEs pursuant to a three-part formula, with: (1) one-half allocated on the basis of the financial need of an school's students; (2) one-quarter allocated on the basis of its efforts at keeping tuition and fees low or providing nonfederal need-based grant aid; and (3) one-quarter allocated on the basis of the school's success at graduating Pell Grant recipients.

Provides each IHE that previously participated in the part E Perkins Loan program with a minimum Direct Perkins Loan authority amount equal to the average amount of Perkins Loans it awarded to students for the most recent five years.

(Sec. 225) Gives IHEs an annual payment to cover administrative expenses of servicing old part E Perkins Loans that equals 0.5% of the outstanding principal and interest of such loans.

(Sec. 228) Requires a capital distribution of the balance of each IHE's part E Perkins Loan fund beginning on July 1, 2010, with the federal contribution paid to the Secretary and the school's contribution returned to the school.

Permits IHEs, after June 2010, to assign all their outstanding part E Perkins Loans to the Secretary, who thereby assumes responsibility for servicing the loans and returning to the schools the proportion of the loan amount that was made from schools' capital contributions to the revolving loan fund.

(Sec. 229) Makes the following amendments affecting the application of the requirement that for-profit IHEs derive at least 10% of their revenues from non-title IV sources (the 90/10 rule) applicable through June 2012.

Continues to treat the revenue of for-profit IHEs that is derived from unsubsidized Direct Stafford Loan limit increases established under the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 as being from non-title IV sources. (Such treatment was set to expire on July 1, 2011.)

Excludes from revenue calculations amounts for-profit IHEs receive under the new Direct Perkins Loans program.

Gives for-profit IHEs two (currently, one) consecutive years of failing the 90/10 rule before they are considered provisionally eligible, and three (currently, two) consecutive years of failure before becoming ineligible, to participate in title IV programs.
