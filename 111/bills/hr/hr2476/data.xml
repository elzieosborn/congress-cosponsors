  <summary date="2010-08-10T16:58:18Z" status="Passed House amended">Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act of 2010 - Amends the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 to require the term and acreage of permits for the operation of ski areas and associated facilities (under current law, for the operation of nordic and alpine ski areas and facilities) on National Forest System lands to be governed by provisions under the Act relating to such permits and other applicable law.

Provides for the issuance of permits for the use and occupancy of suitable lands within the National Forest System for skiing and other snow-sports and such other seasonal or year-round recreational activities associated with mountain resorts as the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) may authorize pursuant to this Act.

Requires any authorized activity, facility, or improvement other than skiing and other snow-sports to: (1) encourage outdoor recreation and enjoyment of nature; (2) harmonize with the natural environment of the National Forest System land on which it is located; (3) be located within the parts of the ski permit area that are developed to support skiing and other snow sports; and (4) be consistent with the applicable forest management plan and all other applicable laws.

Prohibits the Secretary from authorizing an activity, facility, or improvement under this Act if its authorization would result in the primary recreational purpose of the National Forest System land with a ski area permit being a purpose other than skiing or any other snow-sport. Allows the Secretary to authorize such an activity, facility, or improvement only to the extent that the majority of the ski area's revenue is generated by the sale of lift tickets and related fees for skiing and other snow-sport activities.

Bars the Secretary from considering the need for activities other than skiing and snow-sports when determining the boundary of a ski area permit.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) promulgate new rules and regulations for the implementation of this Act; and (2) convert all ski area permits or leases on National Forest System lands into ski area permits which conform to the provisions of this Act.</summary>
