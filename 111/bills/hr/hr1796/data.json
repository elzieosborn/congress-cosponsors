Sets limitations on the use of grant funds for: (1) administrative costs not directly related to such training of state and local fire officials; and (2) the costs of the activities of such public outreach.\n\n Gives priority to applications from states or local governments that: (1) require the installation of approved carbon monoxide alarms in existing dwelling units within which a fuel-burning appliance, apparatus, or device is installed or which has an attached garage; (2) propose to serve vulnerable populations; and (3) have greater than average losses of life from carbon monixide poisoning in the home.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations through FY2015 to the CPSC to carry out this Act.\n\nRequires the CPSC to report on the implementation of the grant program authorized by this Act."
