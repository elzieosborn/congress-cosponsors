Requires additional notifications based on changed circumstances. Allows each member or veteran the option to decline further notifications.\n\nDirects the Secretary to use transferred data to reduce the amount of information that a member or veteran must provide when applying for benefits.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Defense to provide a member or veteran the opportunity to decline authorization for the transfer of information under this Act."
