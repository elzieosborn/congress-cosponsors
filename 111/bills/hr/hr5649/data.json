    "text": "Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2010 - Prohibits a state or local jurisdiction from imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on or with respect to the sale or use of digital goods or services delivered or transferred electronically to a customer.\n\nRestricts taxation of digital goods and services to the retail sale of such goods and services and by the jurisdiction encompassing a customer's tax address.\n\nProhibits the use of existing regulations or administrative rulings relating to the taxation of tangible personal property or other services to impose any tax on the sale or use of digital goods or services.\n\nProhibits taxation on or with respect to the sale or use of digital medical, education, or energy management services.\n\nProvides that if charges for digital goods and services are not separately stated from charges for other goods or services, the charges for digital goods and services may be taxed at the same rate and on the same basis as charges for other goods and services unless the seller can reasonably identify the charges for digital goods and services from its business records.\n\nGrants jurisdiction to federal district courts to prevent a violation of this Act.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that each state shall take reasonable steps to prevent multiple taxation of digital goods and services where a foreign country has imposed a tax on such goods and services."
