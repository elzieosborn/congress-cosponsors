    "text": "Safe And Fair Enforcement and Recall for Meat, Poultry, and Food Act of 2009 or the SAFER Meat, Poultry, and Food Act of 2009 - Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act to require a person (other than a household consumer) who has reason to believe that a meat or poultry article handled by such person is adulterated or misbranded to notify the Secretary of Agriculture of the identity and location of the article. Directs the Secretary, upon finding that the article is adulterated or misbranded and there is a reasonable probability that human consumption would present a threat to public health, to: (1) provide all appropriate persons an opportunity to cease distribution of the article, make appropriate notifications, and recall the article; and (2) require an immediate cessation of distribution if voluntary action is not taken.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to: (1) refuse to provide, or to withdraw, inspections of an establishment for willful or repeated violations of the respective Act; (2) deny or suspend inspection in the public interest to protect the health or welfare of consumers or to ensure the effective performance of an official duty under the respective Act; and (3) assess civil penalties for violations.\n\nAmends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require a person (other than a household consumer or other individual who is an intended consumer) who has reason to believe that an article of food introduced into interstate commerce is adulterated or misbranded in a manner that, if consumed, may result in illness or injury to notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Directs the Secretary, upon finding that to be the case, to: (1) provide all appropriate persons an opportunity to cease distribution of such article, make appropriate notifications, and recall the article; and (2) require an immediate cessation of distribution if voluntary action is not taken. Allows the Secretary to assess penalties for prohibited acts."
