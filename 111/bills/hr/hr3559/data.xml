  <summary date="2009-10-22T19:19:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Supporting ColoRectal Examination and Education Now (SCREEN) Act of 2009 - Declares the sense of Congress that colorectal cancer screening tests and the provisions of this Act should be included as part of any basic benefit package in any legislation that may be enacted to provide health insurance coverage, public or private, to persons under age 65.

Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to states and Indian tribes for colorectal health programs.

Directs the Secretary to establish a program to notify all beneficiaries annually about coverage of colorectal cancer screening tests under title XVII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA).

Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid), as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, to require any state Medicaid plan that includes colorectal cancer screening tests to provide for a program to notify individuals at risk for colon cancer, including high-risk minorities, who are over an appropriate age, of the availability of medical assistance for colorectal cancer screening tests.

Amends SSA title XVIII (Medicare) to eliminate coinsurance for colorectal cancer screening tests.

Prescribes annual reporting requirements under the Medicare Advantage program with regard to colorectal cancer screening tests.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a national minimum standard for basic knowledge, training, continuing education, and documentation for suppliers who furnish colorectal cancer screening tests; (2) determine age-based goal rates for such tests; and (3) establish an upward preventive service payment modifier for qualifying tests furnished on or after January 1, 2010, which reflects the Secretary's annual determination of the appropriate amount of additional payment sufficient to increase the rate of colorectal cancer screening tests.

Extends Medicare coverage to an office visit or consultation prior to a qualifying screening colonoscopy.</summary>
