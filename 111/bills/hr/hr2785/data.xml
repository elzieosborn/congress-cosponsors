Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a process under which a physician may request from a carrier written assistance in addressing questionable codes and procedures under the Medicare program.

Requires the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to restore the toll-free telephone hotline so that physicians may call for information and questions about the Medicare program.

Prohibits the Administrator from implementing any new evaluation and management (E&amp;M) guidelines under the Medicare program unless the Administrator: (1) has provided for an assessment of the proposed guidelines by physicians; (2) has established a plan that contains specific goals, including a schedule for improving participation of physicians in such assessment; (3) has carried out a minimum of four pilot projects in at least four different regions to test E&amp;M guidelines; and (4) finds that specified objectives will be met in the implementation of such guidelines.

Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) physician participation and pilot program testing requirements and objectives for new E&amp;M guidelines under Medicare; and (2) notice, administrative, and penalty requirements with respect to Medicare overpayments.</summary>
