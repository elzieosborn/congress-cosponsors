Requires the Secretary to issue regulations that establish minimum standards for the training of testers of organizations funded with any amounts made available under this Act.

(Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should: (1) fully comply with such Act's requirements to establish, design, and maintain a national education and outreach program for the development and dissemination of the fair housing rights of individuals who seek to rent, purchase, sell, or facilitate the sale of a home; (2) expend all amounts appropriated for such program; (3) promulgate regulations on the fair housing obligations of each recipient of federal housing and community development funds to affirmatively further fair housing; and (4) fully comply with HUD administrative enforcement requirements regarding complaints of alleged discriminatory housing practices.
