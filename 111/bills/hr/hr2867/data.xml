Requires the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to develop anti-fraud measures and procedures to ensure that only eligible households and individuals receive a coupon.

Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to promulgate rules requiring that each multichannel video programming distributor providing broadcast television for a local market provide to eligible consumers in that local market access to basic broadcast television service. Requires the FCC to develop anti-fraud measures and procedures to ensure that only eligible consumers are provided access to basic broadcast television service.
