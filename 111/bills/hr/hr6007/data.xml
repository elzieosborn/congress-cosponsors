  <summary date="2010-10-22T20:50:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Trade Enforcement Priorities Act - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to revise requirements for investigations by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) of priority foreign country practices which if eliminated will likely have the most significant potential to increase U.S. exports.

Urges the USTR, before initiating an investigation, to seek consultations with each foreign country identified as engaging in priority foreign country trade practices in order to reach a satisfactory resolution of such practices. Requires the USTR to initiate an investigation only if a satisfactory resolution has not been reached within 90 days after a report on the practices to the appropriate congressional committees.</summary>
