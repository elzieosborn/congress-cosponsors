    "text": "Acid Rain and Mercury Control Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to reduce specified amounts of aggregate sulfur dioxide emissions and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants by January 1, 2012. Authorizes the regulations to include market-oriented mechanisms.\n\nRequires the Administrator to coordinate with federal and state governments to increase energy efficiency, to increase the use of renewable energy, and to implement cost saving advanced demand and supply side policies.\n\nRequires a power plant, by the later of the date that is 30 years after it commenced operation or the date that is five years after this Act's enactment, to comply with the specified new source performance standards and specified requirements applicable to modified sources under the Clean Air Act.\n\nConsiders affected units (coal-fired electric generating facilities that have a nameplate capacity greater than 25 megawatts and that generate electricity for sale) that commence operation after December 31, 2010, to be new units. Prohibits such units from exceeding the mercury emission limit of 0.6 pounds mercury per trillion Btu upon commencement of operation. Prohibits affected units that commence operation on or before December 31, 2010, from exceeding such limit by January 1, 2013.\n\nSets forth penalties for excess emissions. Requires the Administrator to ensure that mercury captured or recovered by emission controls installed at affected units is not re-released into the environment.\n\nProhibits owners or operators of electricity generating facilities from: (1) operating such facilities in noncompliance with the requirements of this Act; (2) failing to submit allowances or penalties or to provide and comply with any plan to offset excess emissions; and (3) emitting mercury in excess of the emission limitations.\n\nProhibits any person from holding, using, or transferring emission allowances allocated under such Act that are not in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this Act affects the ability of states to take actions to further limit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or mercury.\n\nDirects the Administrator to promulgate regulations to protect specified sensitive ecosystems if the emissions reductions under title VII of the Clean Air Act are not sufficient to ensure the protection and restoration of such ecosystems."
