  <summary date="2009-04-20T18:52:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Renewable Fuel Pipelines Act of 2009 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to allow federally-guaranteed loans for renewable fuel pipeline construction without regard to whether an appropriation for the cost has been made. Includes ethanol and biodiesel as renewable fuel.

Allows a maximum guarantee by the Secretary of Energy of 90% of the project cost and more than one guarantee for a project (as long as the total guaranteed amount does not exceed 90%).

Sets forth factors to be considered in guarantee determinations, including volume and quality of fuel, size of markets served, experience of the entity working with renewable fuel, and associated storage, production, and terminal facilities.

Authorizes an entity implementing a fuel pipeline project for which a guarantee is made, when such entity is unable to acquire the necessary right-of-way to construct, operate, and maintain pipelines and the necessary land or property for the location of pump stations, pressure apparatus, and other necessary facilities or equipment by contract, to acquire what is necessary through eminent domain if determined by the Secretary to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.

Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants for renewable fuel pipeline projects to assist in carrying out permit acquisition, planning, and other preparatory activities in advance of participation in the guarantee program. Limits the sum of grants and amounts guaranteed for a project that receives both to 90% of the project's cost.</summary>
