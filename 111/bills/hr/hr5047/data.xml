Increases the grant funding for low-income taxpayer clinics.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) prescribe regulations for the regulation of tax return preparers; (2) require the annual registration of refund delivery product facilitators; and (3) furnish to the public the identity of any person who is an enrolled agent, attorney, or certified public accountant on file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), who is a tax return preparer, or who is registered as a refund delivery product facilitator.

 Applies the penalty for understatements of taxpayer liability by tax return preparers to tax submissions other than tax returns or claims for refunds.

Requires the Secretary to make an individualized lien determination before filing a notice of lien and to consider specified factors in making such determination, including the amount due, the value of the taxpayer's equity in property, the taxpayer's compliance history, and extenuating circumstances, if any, that explain the tax delinquency.

Prohibits persons licensed to practice before the Department of the Treasury from directly or indirectly offering or providing audit insurance.

Authorizes the National Taxpayer Advocate to issue Taxpayer Advocate directives for granting relief to taxpayers.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the IRS should take specified steps within two years to improve service to taxpayers.

Authorizes the Secretary to award demonstration project grants to provide access to accounts at financial institutions for taxpayers who do not currently have such access.
