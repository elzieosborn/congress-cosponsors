Sets forth requirements for registries, including that such registries: (1) allow a donor to include a statement or symbol that the donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; (2) allow organ procurement organizations to access that information, at or near the donor's death; and (3) bar the use or disclosure of personally identifiable information for any other purpose without the donor's consent.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a living donor database to track health effects for donors associated with living organ donation."
