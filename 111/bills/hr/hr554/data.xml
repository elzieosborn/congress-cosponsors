Requires at least one member of the Advisory Panel to be an individual employed by and representing a minority-serving institution.

Rewrites provisions for triennial external review of the Program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2012 for such reviews from the amounts provided by participating agencies supporting the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office.

Modifies the definition of "nanotechnology." Defines "nanoscale" as one or more dimensions of between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers.

(Sec. 3) Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to designate an associate director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy as the Coordinator for Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology. Makes the Coordinator responsible for oversight of the coordination, planning, and budget prioritization of activities required by the Program to ensure that ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal concerns are considered during the nanotechnology development.

Includes among the Coordinator's responsibilities: (1) ensuring that the plan for the environmental, health, and safety research activities is developed, updated, and implemented and responsive to recommendations of the subpanel of the Advisory Panel; (2) encouraging and monitoring efforts of participating agencies to allocate resources and management necessary to ensure that societal concerns related to nanotechnology are addressed; and (3) encouraging agencies developing the research plan to implement mechanisms establishing public-private partnerships supporting environmental, health, and safety research.

Requires the Coordinator to convene a panel to develop a research plan for the Environmental, Health, and Safety program component area. Instructs such panel to solicit and be responsive to recommendations from the subpanel of the Advisory Panel and the agencies responsible for environmental, health, and safety regulations associated with nanoscale materials and products. Requires the plan to include a description of how the Program will help to ensure the development of standards related to engineered nanoscale materials. Specifies the plan's components and requires it to be updated annually.

 Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), as part of the mathematics and science education partnerships program carried out pursuant to the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002, to provide one or more grants to establish Nanotechnology Education Partnerships and requires each such partnership to include one or more businesses engaged in nanoscale production.

Requires such partnerships to be designed to recruit and to help prepare secondary school students to pursue postsecondary level nanotechnology courses.

Requires such grants to support: (1) activities to inform teachers and students about career possibilities in nanotechnology; and (2) identification of nanotechnology educational materials and incorporation of nanotechnology into the curriculum at one or more organizations participating in a Partnership.

Requires the Program, as part of the activities included under the Education and Societal Dimensions program component area to support efforts to introduce nanoscale science, engineering, and technology into undergraduate science and engineering education. Includes as supported activities: (1) the development of courses or modules to existing courses; (2) faculty professional development; and (3) the acquisition of equipment and instrumentation suitable for undergraduate education and research.
