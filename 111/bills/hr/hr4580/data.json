(Repeals provisions of the Post-Katrina Management Reform Act of 2006 regarding a Metropolitan Medical Response Program.)\n\nDirects the Assistant Secretary, Office of Health Affairs, to develop programmatic and policy guidance for the Program in coordination with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary, through the Administrator, to enter in contracts with local jurisdictions to assist in preparing for and responding to mass casualty incidents. Authorizes the use of contracts to support the integration of emergency management, health, and medical systems into a coordinated response to mass casualty incidents caused by any hazard.\n\nSets forth eligibility requirements. Encourages local jurisdictions receiving assistance under the Program to develop and maintain memoranda of understanding and agreement with neighboring jurisdictions to support a system of mutual aid among the jurisdictions.\n\nRequires the Administrator: (1) in coordination with the Assistant Secretary, Office of Health Affairs, and a National Metropolitan Medical Response System Working Group, to issue performance measures for each local jurisdiction that enters a contract under this Act; and (2) together with the Assistant Secretary and the Working Group, to conduct a review of the Program."
