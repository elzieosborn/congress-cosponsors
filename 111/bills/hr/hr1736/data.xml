  <summary date="2009-06-16T19:36:20Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 21, 2009. The summary of that version is repeated here.) 

International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2009 - Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to establish a committee under the National Science and Technology Council that has the responsibility of identifying and coordinating international science and technology cooperation that can strengthen U.S. science and technology enterprise, improve economic and national security, and support U.S. foreign policy goals.

Requires the committee to be co-chaired by senior level officials from OSTP and the Department of State.

Requires the committee to: (1) plan and coordinate interagency international science and technology cooperative research and training activities and partnerships supported or managed by federal agencies; (2) establish federal priorities and policies for aligning such international science and technology cooperative research and training activities and partnerships with the foreign policy goals of the United States; (3) identify opportunities for new international science and technology cooperative research and training partnerships that advance science and technology and U.S. foreign policy priorities; (4) solicit recommendations from non-federal science and technology stakeholders; (5) work with international science and technology counterparts to establish and maintain partnerships; and (6) address broad issues that influence the ability of U.S. scientists and engineers to collaborate with foreign counterparts.

Requires the Director of OSTP to report annually to Congress on: (1) the priorities and policies established under this Act; (2) the ongoing and new partnerships identified in the previous year; and (3) how stakeholder input was received.</summary>
