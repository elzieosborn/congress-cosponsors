  <summary date="2009-06-25T15:59:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Domestic Violence Leave Act - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to entitle an eligible employee, his or her same-sex spouse, or domestic partner to up to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period: (1) to care for such individual's family member, if the family member is addressing domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking and their effects; or (2) because such individual is addressing such matters, he or she is unable to perform any of the functions of his or her position.

Authorizes such individual to substitute any of his or her accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, family leave, or medical or sick leave for any of the 12-week period of such leave.

Authorizes an employer to require an employee to certify with documentation the basis of the leave request.

Declares that nothing in this Act shall require an employer to provide paid sick leave or paid medical leave in any situation in which such employer would not normally provide any such paid leave.

Amends federal civil service law to entitle civilian federal employees, their same-sex spouses, or domestic partners to the same leave allowance. Provides for the substitution of accrued paid annual or sick leave for any part of the 12-week period. Authorizes the employing agency to require an employee to certify with documentation the basis of the leave request.</summary>
