  <summary date="2009-10-21T15:08:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Grants to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Commerce similar authority to allow members of the Public Health Service and of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps, respectively, to transfer unused benefits under the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program to family members. (Currently, this benefits transfer option applies only to the Secretary of Defense [DOD] and members of the Armed Forces.)

Requires such personnel, at the time their benefits transfer request is approved, to have completed: (1) six years of service in the Public Health Service or NOAA Corps and agreed to serve at least four more; or (2) the years of service determined by the appropriate Secretary.

Authorizes the transfer to family members of up to 36 months of unused post-9/11 educational assistance, although the appropriate Secretary may limit such transfer to as little as 18 months of assistance.</summary>
