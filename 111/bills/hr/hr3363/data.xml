  <summary date="2009-10-21T19:03:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Small Business Act to allow the head of an executive agency, in complying with a preference under any law for contracting with a small business owned and controlled by veterans or service-disabled veterans, to consider only a small business verified (or waiting to be verified) in the small business database maintained by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Requires such agency head, when any prime contract requires the contractor to comply with such preference, to require the prime contractor, in awarding subcontracts, to consider only small business concerns that are verified in that database.</summary>
