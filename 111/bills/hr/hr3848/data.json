Prohibits the Inspector General from issuing the subpoena if the Attorney General objects within such seven days. Requires the Attorney General, if he or she objects, to find in writing within 30 days after receiving such notice that the testimony: (1) is likely to endanger U.S. national security, to interfere with a federal or state criminal investigation or prosecution, or to interfere with civil litigation to which the United States is, or is likely to be, a party; or (2) otherwise is not authorized by this Act."
