The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)\n\n\n\nHelp to Access Land for the Education of Scouts or HALE Scouts Act - Requires the conveyance of specified National Forest System land in the Ouachita National Forest in Oklahoma to the Indian Nations Council, Inc., of the Boy Scouts of America. Excludes from such conveyance the inclusion of any land within the Indian Nations National Scenic and Wildlife Area designated under the Winding Stair Mountain National Recreation and Wilderness Area Act.\n\nRequires the Council, as consideration for such land, to pay to the Secretary of Agriculture the fair market value of the land, as determined by an appraisal approved by the Secretary and done to conform with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and the provisions relating to exchanges of public lands and interests within the National Forest System under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.\n\nProvides for the deposit of such consideration into the fund established by the Sisk Act. Makes the deposited amount available for expenditure for the acquisition of land and interests in the Ouachita National Forest.\n\nStates that access to the conveyed land shall be from the adjacent land of the Council or its successor. Bars the Secretary from being required to provide additional access to such land.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to prescribe such terms and conditions on the conveyance as the Secretary considers in the public interest, including the reservation of access rights to the conveyed land for administrative purposes."
