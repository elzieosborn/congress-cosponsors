  <summary date="2010-02-23T14:37:43Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans to Work Pilot Program Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to establish the Veterans to Work pilot program to determine: (1) the maximum extent to which apprentices may be employed on designated military construction projects; (2) the maximum extent to which such apprentices are veterans; and (3) the feasibility of expanding the employment of apprentices to military construction projects other than those designated. Requires the Secretary, for each of FY2011-FY2015, to designate for the pilot program at least 20 military construction projects, taking into account specified considerations.

Requires each contractor or subcontractor on a designated project to assure that it participates in a qualified apprenticeship or other training program for each craft or trade classification of worker that it intends to employ on the construction project.</summary>
