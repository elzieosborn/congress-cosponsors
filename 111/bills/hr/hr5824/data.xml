  <summary date="2010-09-22T20:53:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Transportation and Housing Affordability Transparency Act - Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to develop publicly a transportation affordability index that measures the transportation costs associated with the location of a home, both on a neighborhood and regional basis.

Requires HUD to make the index publicly available through the Internet, as well as to Multiple Listing Services for real estate, regional and metropolitan planning organizations, local housing and planning agencies, and states, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and transportation management agencies.

Requires HUD to: (1) incorporate transportation costs associated with the location of housing into affordability measures and standards for HUD housing programs; (2) provide related information and resources to states to encourage them to incorporate transportation costs into their housing and land use plans; (3) work with regional and local government entities to integrate housing, transportation, and other costs associated with location into long-range transportation, land use, housing and community development, or investment plans; and (4) work with federal agencies to incorporate the transportation affordability index.</summary>
