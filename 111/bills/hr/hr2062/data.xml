Migratory Bird Treaty Act Penalty and Enforcement Act of 2009 - Amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to subject a person who kills or wounds any migratory bird in an aggravated manner in violation of such Act, in lieu of any penalty for such violation, to: (1) a fine and/or imprisonment for no more than a year for the first violation; and (2) a fine and/or imprisonment for no more than two years for subsequent violations. Defines "aggravated manner" to mean deliberately and in a manner that: (1) demonstrates indifference to the pain and suffering of the bird; or (2) involves actions that would shock a reasonable person.

Grants the Secretary of the Interior authority provided for undercover or enforcement operations under the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978 to detect and prosecute violations of this Act, including the authority to use funds for payments for information, rewards, or evidence concerning such violations.</summary>
