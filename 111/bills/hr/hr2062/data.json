Defines \"aggravated manner\" to mean deliberately and in a manner that: (1) demonstrates indifference to the pain and suffering of the bird; or (2) involves actions that would shock a reasonable person.\n\nGrants the Secretary of the Interior authority provided for undercover or enforcement operations under the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978 to detect and prosecute violations of this Act, including the authority to use funds for payments for information, rewards, or evidence concerning such violations."
