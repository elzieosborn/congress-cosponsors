Outlines information required to be included in such statement, including: (1) the possibility of radiation containment failure and the effects of such failure; (2) possible long-term effects on the water table from underground radiation leakage; and (3) information with respect to certain kiloton categories of weapons.\n\nProhibits the United States from resuming any such testing unless authorized by a law enacted after the enactment of this Act.\n\nRequires: (1) advance public notice of each test by the President; (2) notice of each release of radiation beyond the boundaries of the Nevada Test Site by the Secretary of Energy within one hour of detection of such radiation; and (3) public meetings in southern Utah, Arizona, and Nevada after each test to discuss test results.\n\nDirects the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the safety and health of citizens in the vicinity of the Nevada Test Site.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a Nevada Test Site Citizens Review Board.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Homeland Security to make grants to institutions of higher education to acquire and operate, for ten years, radiation detection equipment and sensors.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy, through the Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to monitor the nature and extent of any radiation released into the atmosphere as a result of such testing. Requires: (1) DOE radiation containment assessment; and (2) public notice of monitoring data.\n\nRequires the: (1) Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to make a grant to establish the National Center for the Study of Radiation and Human Health; and (2) Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study of individuals exposed to nuclear weapons tests."
