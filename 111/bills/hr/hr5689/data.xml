  <summary date="2010-09-01T20:39:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Predatory Lending Sunset Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to limit the maximum interest rate which a creditor may charge on a covered consumer credit loan of up to $3,000 to an annual percentage rate (APR) of 36%.

Prohibits a creditor from extending a covered loan with respect to which the creditor uses as security either: (1) access to a borrower's financial account; or (2) the title of a vehicle.

Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prohibit a remotely created check that: (1) is not created by the financial institution that holds the customer account from which the check is to be paid; and (2) does not bear a signature applied by the person from whose account the check is to be paid.

Declares unenforceable, with respect to any consumer, any contract made in violation of this Act.</summary>
