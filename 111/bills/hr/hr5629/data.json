    "text": "Oil Spill Accountability and Environmental Protection Act of 2010 - Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to: (1) repeal the limitation on the liability of the responsible party for an offshore facility for damages and removal costs that result from a discharge of oil into or upon the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines or the U.S. exclusive economic zone; (2) increase the amount of financial responsibility required for offshore facilities to $1.5 billion; (3) make responsible parties for vessels or facilities from which oil is discharged liable for damages to human health; and (4) authorize the President to require a responsible party to provide information about claims in the event of a spill of national significance.\n\nRepeals provisions of the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 that limit the liability of the owner of a vessel from claims, debt, or liability to the value of the vessel and pending freight.\n\nAmends the Death on the High Seas Act to allow a civil action in law to benefit a decedent's survivors for the death of an individual that is caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas beyond three nautical miles from the U.S. shore. Amends the Jones Act to authorize a decedent's survivors to recover fair compensation for nonpecuniary losses and the decedent's pain and suffering.\n\nLimits the exploration, development, or production of resources in, on, above, or below the exclusive economic zone to vessels owned by U.S. citizens.\n\nSets forth provisions concerning safety management systems and standards for mobile offshore drilling units. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to designate positions to be in the Coast Guard's marine safety workforce to perform vessel and marine casualty investigations.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revoke the President's authorization to allow tank vessels and facilities to operate without a plan to respond to the discharge of oil or hazardous substances. Requires the President to: (1) issue a revised regulation for the development of the schedule for the use of dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill mitigating devices and substances; (2) undertake a rulemaking concerning standards for ceasing and removing a worst case discharge of oil or a hazardous substance and for mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of such discharge; (3) create a database to track all discharges of oil or hazardous substances; and (4) delegate specified responsibilities with respect to oil discharges to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, and the Secretary of Transportation (DOT). Revises provisions concerning: (1) responses to discharges of oil or hazardous substances by vessels and facilities; and (2) penalties for such discharges.\n\nRequires a pipeline facility operator in an area affected by a disaster to notify the Secretary of Transportation of changes to the operational status of such facility within 12 hours of cessation of the disaster.\n\nRequires the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling to develop recommendations for: (1) improvements to federal laws, regulations, and industry practices applicable to offshore drilling to ensure effective oversight, inspection, monitoring, and response capabilities and protect human and occupational health and safety and the environment; and (2) reforms of federal agencies or processes to ensure that such improvements are implemented and maintained.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to report on the employment during the preceding year of individuals who were Coast Guard officials in the previous five-year period by recognized organizations contracted to administer maritime programs for foreign flag administrations."
