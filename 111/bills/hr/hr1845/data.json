Limits grants to $300,000 per entity ($250,000 with respect to the latter two programs). Authorizes appropriations under each program for FY2010-FY2011.\n\nProhibits funds recovered under an SBDC program through fees assessed to small business clients from being considered matching funds.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for the SBDC program for FY2010-FY2011."
