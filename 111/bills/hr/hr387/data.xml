  <summary date="2010-06-16T14:15:46Z" status="Introduced in House">TARP Accountability Act of 2009 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to require inclusion within each report of condition filed by an insured depository institution which received assistance under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) the amount of any increase in new lending during the period covered by the report (or the amount of any reduction in any decrease in new lending) that is attributable to TARP assistance.

 Requires, in the alternative, that if the institution cannot accurately quantify the effect such assistance has had on new lending, then it report the total amount of the increase in new lending, if any, during the covered period.</summary>
