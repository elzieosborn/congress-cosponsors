Authorizes the Secretary to waive such prohibition if in the U.S. national interest.\n\nStates that such provisions shall cease to be effective when the Secretary certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of the Russian Federation has conducted a thorough and impartial investigation into Mr. Magnitsky's detention and death, and the responsible individuals have been brought to justice according to the Russian Federation's laws and pursuant to its international legal obligations; (2) the government of the Russian Federation has taken steps to bring its criminal justice and penal systems into compliance with international legal standards; and (3) the U.S. government is confident that the investigation was properly conducted.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) instruct domestic financial institutions and agencies to take specified measures if the Secretary makes a money laundering determination relating to such conspiracy; and (2) freeze and prohibit U.S. property transactions of an individual who is prohibited from entering the United States or acts as an agent for an such individual.\n\nStates that such provisions shall cease to be effective when the Secretary of the Treasury certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of the Russian Federation has conducted a thorough and impartial investigation into the conspiracy to defraud the Russian Federation of taxes on corporate profit, and the responsible individuals have been brought to justice according to the Russian Federation's laws and pursuant to its international legal obligations; (2) the government of the Russian Federation has taken steps to bring its criminal justice systems into compliance with international financial and banking standards, and has strengthened protections for individuals who disclose illegal government activities; and (3) the U.S. government is confident that the investigation was properly conducted."
