Russell National School Lunch Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to award funding competitively to states, through grants or contracts, to carry out comprehensive and innovative demonstration projects that promote the reduction or elimination of childhood hunger by 2015.\n\nRequires the Secretary, when determining the amount of funds to be provided to a state, to consider: (1) the proportion of children in the state eligible for free or reduced price meals under the Act; and (2) the rates of food insecurity, hunger, or poverty in the state.\n\nIncludes among the demonstration projects eligible for funding those that: (1) enhance federal child nutrition program benefits or establish innovative models for the delivery of program benefits; (2) increase children's access to and participation in such programs; and (3) improve the coordination of federal, state, and community resources and services aimed at eliminating food insecurity and hunger.\n\nRequires each state that receives such funding to: (1) collaborate with key stakeholders in the state to develop a comprehensive agenda for eliminating childhood hunger that is approved by the Secretary; (2) set specific performance goals for reducing or eliminating childhood hunger; and (3) arrange for an independent evaluation of its project's effectiveness.\n\nFavors projects with a 25% nonfederal match in cash or in-kind contributions.\n\nLimits project funding to five years and states to no more than one funded project.\n\nMakes the amount of federal funding provided for a project each year contingent on its progress toward performance goals."
