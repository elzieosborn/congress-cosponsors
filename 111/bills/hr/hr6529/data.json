Makes both U.S. and non-U.S. entities with U.S. branches eligible to obtain a federal license.\n\nAuthorizes a national reinsurer to convert to a state-licensed reinsurer, subject to the Director's approval.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), jointly, to enter into supervisory arrangements for the recognition of qualified reinsurance supervisory authorities of non-U.S. jurisdictions that provide a level of protection for U.S. reinsurance consumers that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection achieved under federal regulation.\n\nAmends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to reflect the provisions of this Act."
