Prohibits state action during the pendency of an enforcement action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nExempts from such prohibitions resale restrictions imposed by: (1) sponsors or promoters of charitable events for which all tickets are distributed without charge; and (2) not-for-profit educational institutions for athletic events involving their athletes or teams with respect to tickets initially distributed to students, faculty, staff, or alumni without charge, or to members of bona fide booster organizations."
