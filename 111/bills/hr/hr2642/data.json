Requires the Secretary, upon a positive determination with respect to any such remains, to provide for and cover the cost of the burial and funeral expenses if the Secretary determines that: (1) there is no next of kin or other person claiming the remains; and (2) there are no other sufficient resources to cover such expenses.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a publicly accessible database of the names of any veteran or other individual so identified."
