    "text": "National Fab Lab Network Act of 2010 - Establishes the National Fab Lab Network (NFLN), as a non-profit entity, to facilitate the construction of a network of connected labs.\n\nDefines \"Fab Lab\" or \"Fabrication Laboratory\" to mean a facility containing a variety of manufacturing and other fabrication tools operable by digital input as well as the software and computers required to design and operate those tools. States that these labs serve a broad range of purposes, but each allow for how members of the local community, businesses, and academic or educational purposes can be pursued with the lab's resources.\n\nAuthorizes and empowers the NFLN to receive real or personal property and to hold it absolutely or in trust, and to invest, reinvest, and manage it, and to apply such property and the income arising therefrom to the objects of its creation and according to the instructions of its donors.\n\nSets forth the functions of the NFLN.\n\nRequires the NFLN to: (1) facilitate the construction of a new type of information and digital fabrication infrastructure; and (2) promote the goals of greater science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, workforce development in manufacturing and product design, increased innovation in the private sector, as well as scientific and academic discovery through the use of distributed digital fabrication tools.\n\nPermits acceptance by the NFLN of donations from private individuals, corporations, government agencies, or other organizations."
