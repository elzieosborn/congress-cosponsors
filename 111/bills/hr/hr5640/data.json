    "text": "National Rape Kit Database Act - Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish a publicly available database on information on rape kits collected by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; and (2) provide technical assistance to such agencies to enable participation in the database. Defines \"rape kit\" to mean a sexual assault forensics evidence collection kit.\n\nRequires certain information to be included in such database by law enforcement agencies and laboratories with respect to a rape kit, including: (1) the date of the action constituting the basis for the collection of the rape kit; (2) the city or locality where such action occurred; (3) the date of the entry into the database; (4) the entity that has possession of the rape kit; and (5) the processing status of the rape kit and whether the statute of limitations has expired (for a backlogged case). Prohibits the disclosure in a rape kit of the personally identifiable information of a sexual assault victim (e.g., name, address, or contact information).\n\nDenies grant funds under the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 and the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to states that fail to comply with the requirements of this Act."
