Authorizes the Secretary concerned to reduce the two-year service requirement for a member so recalled to serve as an adjutant or assistant adjutant general in the National Guard when the member serves for at least six months but fails to serve for two years as required by the laws of the state, district, or territory in which the member is serving.\n\nSubtitle C: Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and Veterans' Disability Compensation - (Sec. 121) Extends through 2013 eligibility for the concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans' disability compensation for veterans who were retired or separated due to physical disability, regardless of their disability rating or years of service.\n\nTitle II: Federal Employee Benefits - Subtitle A: General Provisions - (Sec. 201) Provides, with respect to federal employees, credit for unused sick leave for annuity computation purposes.\n\n(Sec. 202) Extends to federal employees who separated before March 1, 1991, (under current law, October 1, 1990) eligibility to receive an actuarially-reduced annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).\n\n(Sec. 203) Revises the computation of certain annuities based on part-time service performed before April 7, 1986.\n\n(Sec. 204) Allows federal employees under the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) to deposit retirement refunds received, with interest.\n\n(Sec. 205) Provides limited federal retirement credit for service in the District of Columbia (D.C.) of certain employees who transferred to federal government service after the D.C. service, but prohibits any D.C. service from being included in the federal annuity computation.
