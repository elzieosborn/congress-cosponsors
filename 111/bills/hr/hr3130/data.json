    "text": "Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act of 2009 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to states to enable them to award competitive subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) or partnerships between LEAs and other public or nonprofit entities to plan and implement expanded learning time initiatives at high-need schools that they serve.\n\nRequires such initiatives to: (1) increase the total number of school hours each year at participant schools by at least 300 hours, compared to the school hours per year that are standard for comparable schools served by their LEAs; and (2) expand learning time for all students in all grade levels in such schools, except in high schools where expanded learning time must apply to at least one entire grade level.\n\nDirects states to give subgrant priority to LEAs that serve a high percentage of students from low-income families and partnerships that include a nonprofit community-based organization or an organization focused on alternative learning or dropout prevention.\n\nPermits the Secretary to: (1) award planning and implementation grants directly to a partnership that serves more that one area in more than one state; and (2) provide technical assistance to grantees and subgrantees in developing and implementing expanded learning time initiatives.\n\nRequires the Secretary to contract with an independent organization with expertise in school improvement, program evaluation, and measurement to evaluate this Act's program and provide technical assistance to grantees and subgrantees in collecting data and evaluating their programs pursuant to specified performance measures."
