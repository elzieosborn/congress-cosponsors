  <summary date="2010-08-03T20:03:29Z" status="Introduced in House">COBRA Health Benefits Extension Act of 2010 - Extends COBRA coverage (health insurance continuation benefits) until the earlier of: (1) the first date in which an individual is eligible for coverage under an employment-based health plan; or (2) the date on which such individual becomes eligible for health insurance coverage through an American Health Benefit Exchange under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).

Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide rules setting forth the form and manner in which prompt notice to individuals of such continued coverage shall be made.

Allows a state to enforce the provisions of this Act with respect to COBRA continuation coverage provided under a state program.

Provides that this Act shall: (1) have no effect on termination of continuation coverage for any reason other than expiration of a period of a specified number of months; and (2) supersede any provision of the law of a state or political subdivision that limits or precludes access by a qualified beneficiary, whose COBRA continuation coverage has been extended under this Act, to a state high risk pool established under PPACA solely by reason of such extension.</summary>
