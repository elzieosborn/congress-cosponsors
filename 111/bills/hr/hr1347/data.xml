  <summary date="2011-01-20T16:39:30Z" status="Passed House amended">Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act of 2010 or the ConTACT Act of 2010 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish and publish concussion management guidelines that address the prevention, identification, treatment, and management of concussions in school-aged children, including standards for such children to return to play after experiencing a concussion. Requires the Secretary to convene a conference of medical, athletic, and educational stakeholders to assist in establishing such guidelines.

Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to states to: (1) provide for the collection by elementary schools, secondary schools, or youth sports associations of information on the incidence and prevalence of concussions among school-aged children attending or participating in sports or activities; (2) adopt, disseminate, and ensure the implementation by such schools and associations of the guidelines; and (3) fund implementation by schools and associations of preseason baseline and post-injury testing, including computerized testing, for school aged children.

Directs the Secretary to require states receiving grants under this Act to utilize applicable expertise and services offered by high school sports associations, youth sports associations, athletic trainer associations, and local chapters of national brain injury organizations in such states.

Requires the Secretary to coordinate with the heads of other federal departments and agencies that carry out activities related to concussions and other traumatic brain injuries.

Sets forth reporting requirements.</summary>
