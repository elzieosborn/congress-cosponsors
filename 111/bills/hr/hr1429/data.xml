Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2009 - Directs the Bureau of Prisons to develop, and draft regulations to implement, a comprehensive policy to provide HIV testing, treatment, and prevention for inmates in federal prisons and upon reentry into the community.

Requires such policy to provide for: (1) testing of inmates upon intake and counseling; (2) pre-test and post-test counseling; (3) improvement of HIV/AIDS awareness and inmate education; (4) HIV testing of inmates annually or upon exposure to HIV; (5) HIV testing of pregnant inmates; (6) comprehensive medical treatment of inmates who test positive and confidential counseling on managing their medical condition and preventing HIV transmission to other persons; (7) protection of inmate confidentiality; (8) testing, counseling, and referral of inmates to health care and social service agencies prior to reentry into the community; (9) the right of inmates to refuse routine testing; (10) excluding as "routine" the testing of an inmate who may have transmitted HIV to any U.S. officer or employee or to any person lawfully present but not incarcerated in a correctional facility; and (11) timely notification to inmates of test results.

Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) require HIV testing for all inmates upon intake regardless of length of sentence or risk factors; (2) allow inmates to decline testing prior to release from incarceration; (3) make HIV test results inadmissible in civil and criminal proceedings; and (4) make HIV testing part of the routine health screening conducted at inmate intake.

Directs the Bureau of Prisons to report to Congress: (1) within one year on Bureau policies and procedures to provide testing, treatment, and prevention education programs for hepatitis and other diseases transmitted through sexual activity and intravenous drug use; and (2) annually on the incidence among inmates of diseases transmitted through sexual activity and intravenous drug use, including specific information on HIV/AIDS.
