  <summary date="2010-04-02T19:52:39Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 with respect to the allocation of surface mining reclamation funds to states and Indian tribes, to modify limitations on the allocation of surface mining reclamation funds to states and Indian tribes to provide for payments for filling voids and sealing tunnels and entryways of non-coal mines as well as coal mines.

Requires uncertified states or Indian tribes to use such allocated funds to fill voids and seal tunnels and entryways of non-coal as well as coal mines. ("Uncertified states and Indian tribes" are those which have not certified to the Secretary of the Interior that all priorities specified under the Act for eligible lands and waters have been achieved.)</summary>
