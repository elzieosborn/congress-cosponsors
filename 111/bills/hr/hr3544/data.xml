  <summary date="2009-11-25T18:37:03Z" status="Introduced in House">National Cemeteries Expansion Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), in selecting a location for the establishment of a new national cemetery, to give priority to a location where at least 110,000 veterans reside within a 75-mile radius.

Requires the Secretary, in conducting an annual performance measure of the percentage of veterans served by a cemetery, to: (1) use census tracts, rather than counties, to test and identify potential cemetery locations and to determine the percentage of veterans served; (2) use methods to avoid the double counting of veterans in overlapping service areas; and (3) count veterans who reside in counties bisected by a service area using a proportional overlay method.</summary>
