  <summary date="2009-07-06T21:21:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a grants program to reduce class size through the use of fully-qualified teachers.

Allots funds to states and local educational agencies to recruit, hire, and train additional teachers in order to: (1) reduce class sizes nationally, in grades one through three, to an average of 18 students per classroom; and (2) improve teaching in those grades so that all students can learn to read independently and well by the end of the third grade.</summary>
