    "text": "Helping Active Duty Deployed Act of 2009 - Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to prohibit a cell phone company from charging an early termination penalty for a cellular telephone contract entered into on behalf of a service member who has received orders for foreign deployment or for permanent change of station within the United States. (Current law provides such protection for a contract entered into by the service member.)\n\nRevises provisions concerning arrearages and other obligations to prohibit a lessor from charging an early termination charge with respect to a residential, professional, business, or agricultural rental lease or a motor vehicle lease entered into by a person who subsequently enters military service, or for a service member who has received orders for permanent change of station or for deployment in support of a military operation. States that: (1) lease amounts for a period preceding the lease termination shall be paid on a prorated basis; and (2) other unpaid lease charges shall be paid by the lessee.\n\nAmends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require an institution of higher education to refund the tuition and fees paid by a student whose absence is due to military service for the payment period or period of enrollment for which such student did not receive academic credit as a result of such absence."
