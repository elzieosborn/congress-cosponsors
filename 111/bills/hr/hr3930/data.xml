  <summary date="2010-04-19T20:16:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Extended COBRA Continuation Protection Act of 2009 - Extends COBRA coverage (health insurance continuation benefits) from 18 months to 24 months for an individual whose COBRA coverage was a consequence of termination (or reduction of hours) of employment occurring on or after April 1, 2008, and before January 1, 2010.

Allows an individual to elect to continue and extend such coverage through an election similar to that permitted under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Declares that the extended period of continuation under this Act shall not exceed six months.

Amends ARRA to extend: (1) until June 30, 2010, the period to determine eligibility for COBRA premium assistance; and (2) the period for which premium assistance is provided to an eligible individual.

Makes this Act effective as if included in the enactment of ARRA.</summary>
