  <summary date="2010-03-05T19:23:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Energy Education Loan Forgiveness Act of 2010 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to provide student loan forgiveness under the Federal Family Education Loan, Direct Loan, and Perkins Loans programs to individuals who have been employed for at least one year after this Act's enactment as full-time skilled energy workers in advanced energy industries.
