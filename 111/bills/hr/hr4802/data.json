Applies to commercial property insurance the exemption of purchasing groups from state law.\n\nRevises procedures for: (1) submitting financial documents to state insurance commissioners; and (2) mandatory disclosures.\n\nImposes a fiduciary duty upon the board of directors of a risk retention group to operate in the best interests of the group.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on actions to ensure that states do not interfere with or regulate risk retention or purchasing groups in an extraterritorial manner precluded by the Act.\n\nRedesignates the Act as the Risk Retention Act."
