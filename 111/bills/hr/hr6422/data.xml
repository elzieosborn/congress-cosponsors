  <summary date="2011-01-20T22:11:37Z" status="Introduced in House">Railroad Retirement Fairness Act - Amends the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to provide that an individual who, at the time the individual makes an inquiry to the Railroad Retirement Board, has a current connection with the railroad industry shall not be deemed to have lost that current connection if: (1) the Board misleads or fails to properly inform that individual about that requirement; and (2) that conduct by the Board, according to the principles of equity, should stop the Board from deeming the individual to have lost that current connection.

Deems an individual who is employed with the Department of State in a position the Secretary of State certifies as railroad related to have "a current connection with the railroad industry" for retirement purposes.

Applies this Act to annuities applied for on or after February 3, 1989.</summary>
