  <summary date="2009-02-06T19:27:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of Transportation to waive, through FY2009, any requirement that would otherwise require a state or local government to contribute non-federal funds toward the cost of a covered transportation program or activity authorized by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFTETEA-LU) or an amendment made by that Act.

Declares, however, that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a state or local government from contributing non-federal funds toward the cost of a covered transportation program or activity.</summary>
