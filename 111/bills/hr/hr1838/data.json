Revises matching funds requirements for all projects. Authorizes appropriations.\n\nDirects the SBA to: (1) establish center performance measures; and (2) require each center to submit an annual funding and strategies plan.\n\nAmends the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 to require the National Women's Business Council to perform studies of: (1) the impact of the 2008-2009 financial markets crisis on women-owned businesses; and (2) the use of SBA programs by women-owned businesses. Authorizes appropriations for the Council for FY2010-FY2011.\n\nIncludes under criteria for the selection of project participants whether the applicant has the capacity to train existing or potential business owners in the fields of green technology, clean technology, or energy efficiency."
