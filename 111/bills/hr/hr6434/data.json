Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit into the Fund not less than 80% of any amounts collected as penalties, settlements, or fines under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) in relation to the oil spill. Requires the Fund to be made available to the Council only for activities related to Gulf coast economic development, ecosystem restoration, and public health rehabilitation that are not inconsistent with the regional ecosystem restoration strategy developed by the Task Force."
