Makes such offense punishable as involuntary manslaughter if it results in death.\n\nDirects the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) establish a website and a toll-free telephone number to receive reports of instances of denial of health care treatment or coverage by insurance entities for investigation of such reports; and (2) report instances for which sufficient evidence exists of a violation of this Act to the Attorney General for further investigation and prosecution.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that each state should thoroughly investigate violations of this Act."
