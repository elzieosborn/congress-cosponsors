  <summary date="2010-08-19T19:08:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Thou Shalt Not Kill Thy Customers Act - Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to one year on any responsible officer or employee of an insurance entity that engages in a denial of coverage under a health plan in violation of provisions of the Public Health Service Act. Makes such offense punishable as involuntary manslaughter if it results in death.

Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) establish a website and a toll-free telephone number to receive reports of instances of denial of health care treatment or coverage by insurance entities for investigation of such reports; and (2) report instances for which sufficient evidence exists of a violation of this Act to the Attorney General for further investigation and prosecution.

Expresses the sense of Congress that each state should thoroughly investigate violations of this Act.</summary>
