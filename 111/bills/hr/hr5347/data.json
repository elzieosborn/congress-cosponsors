Allows the privilege to be claimed by the individual's guardian or conservator. Provides exceptions.\n\nRequires the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide for the expedited consideration of a request for a permanent change of military station or unit transfer submitted by a member of the Armed Forces serving on active duty who was a victim of sexual assault or other sexual offense.\n\nCodifies under federal law a required information database on sexual assault incidents involving members of the Armed Forces.
