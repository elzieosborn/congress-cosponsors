        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2009 - (Sec. 2) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise requirements for public housing agency (PHA) inspections of each dwelling unit for which a housing assistance payment contract is established. Requires an initial inspection before any assistance payment is made. Allows such payments if failure to meet standards is a result only of non-life threatening conditions, as established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p> <p>Requires suspension of payments until each deficiency has been corrected.</p> <p>Permits a PHA, in the case of any property that, within the previous 12 months, has met the requirements of a qualified alternative inspection method, to authorize occupancy before completion of an initial inspection.</p> <p>Requires biennial inspections, in lieu of current annual inspections, to determine compliance. Provides for interim inspections, upon family request, within 24 hours if a noncompliant condition is life-threatening, or within 15 days if not life-threatening.</p> <p>Specifies steps for a determination of noncompliance.</p> <p>Authorizes a PHA to: (1) withhold assistance to a noncomplying unit during a correction period; and (2) use such assistance to make payments relating to such period during which payments were withheld.</p> <p>Authorizes a PHA to: (1) abate all assistance amounts for a noncomplying unit; (2) recommence such payments to its owner upon repair of the unit; and (3) use such abated assistance to make repairs to a noncomplying dwelling unit. Prohibits a contract to make such repairs with the inspector who determined the dwelling unit's failure.</p> <p>Requires a PHA to: (1) notify the tenant and the dwelling unit owner upon commencement of an abatement; (2) require the tenant to move if the dwelling unit is not brought into compliance within a specified period of time; and (3) issue the tenant the necessary forms to allow the move, transferring the rental assistance to the new unit.</p> <p>Prohibits a dwelling unit owner from terminating the tenancy of any tenant because of the withholding or abatement of assistance.
