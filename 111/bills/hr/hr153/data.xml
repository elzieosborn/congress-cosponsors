  <summary date="2009-01-13T20:11:44Z" status="Introduced in House">Worker Savings Account Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish worker savings accounts to make payments to workers during periods of unemployment; (2) treat such accounts in the same manner as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for tax purposes; (3) allow employer matching contributions to such accounts; (4) make a portion of the tax credit for contributions to retirement accounts (saver's credit) refundable; and (5) require increases in the saver's credit to be paid into a worker savings account.

Provides that no provision of this Act shall be construed to diminish an employer's obligation to pay federal and state unemployment taxes or to reduce the amount of unemployment compensation to which a worker may be entitled.</summary>
