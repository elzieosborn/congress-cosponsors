Includes among the amounts the Administrator is authorized to obligate from proceeds from the disposition of excess real property: (1) amounts to pay the costs related to identifying and preparing properties to be reported excess by another agency; and (2) amounts to pay the costs associated with the reversion, custody, and disposal of reverted real property. Revises requirements for federal agency retention of proceeds from the transfer or sale of excess real property.

Provides that requirements under the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act for the use of public buildings and real property to assist the homeless shall not apply to certain non-excess federal buildings or real property selected for demolition.</summary>
