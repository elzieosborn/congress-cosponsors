Limits projects funded through these grants to construction and development on non-federal property within the boundaries of the Park. Instructs that any project funded by such grants support the purposes of the Park, be consistent with the Park's general management plan, and enhance public use and enjoyment of the park.\n\nRemoves the Neil Armstrong Air & Space Museum, Wapakoneta, Ohio, from inclusion in the boundaries of the the National Aviation Heritage Area."
