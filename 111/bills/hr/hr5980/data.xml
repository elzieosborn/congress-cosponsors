  <summary date="2010-11-12T21:59:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Bring Jobs Back to America: Strategic Manufacturing &amp; Job Repatriation Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to create a comprehensive national manufacturing strategy to increase overall domestic production, create private sector jobs, and identify emerging technologies to strengthen American competitiveness and comparative advantages.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) identify U.S. firms maintaining facilities and jobs outside the United States; and (2) establish multiple Repatriation Task Forces to promote repatriation (return of a job or facility from a foreign country location to a U.S. location) in accordance with established targets for job repatriation and manufacturing growth.

Establishes the American Economic Security Commission to study and report to Congress on policy relating to American competitiveness and technology-based planning to bolster it.

Directs the Secretary, in conjunction with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to study and report to Congress on the impact and feasibility of a tax incentive to encourage firms to repatriate jobs back to the United States.

Amends federal patent law to revise requirements regarding the publication of patent applications. Requires abstracts (short summaries of inventions) included with patent applications (instead of the patent applications themselves, as under current law) to be published 18 months after the earliest filing date of the application.

Repeals certain requirements relating to: (1) submission of a redacted copy of an application; and (2) procedures to prevent protest and pre-issuance opposition to the grant of a patent.

Requires the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to give priority to the examination of a patent application by an institution of higher education or a patent holding company affiliated with such an institution.</summary>
