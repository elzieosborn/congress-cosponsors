Includes among the required uses of grant funds working toward and acquiring a general equivalency diploma, literacy training, vocational training and education, jobs and skills training, and mentoring sessions.

Requires curriculum participants to undergo an assessment of their mental, physical, intellectual, and vocational abilities. Extends incentives to inmates for participation in the program, including good time credit, monetary compensation, additional and more flexible visitation rights, and letters of recommendation.

Authorizes the Attorney General to award a grant to the National Institute of Justice to design and conduct a study of the curriculums funded by this Act.</summary>
