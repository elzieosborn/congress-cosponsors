  <summary date="2010-04-08T14:04:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Terrorist Entry Program Act of 2010 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to bar the admission of any alien (other than an immediate relative or a diplomat/foreign government official) who is a national of, or residing in, a country determined to be a state sponsor of terrorism.

Authorizes the waiver of such prohibition for: (1) emergency medical treatment; or (2) admission as a refugee or asylee.

Treats Yemen as a state sponsor of terrorism until the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) reports to Congress that Yemen has addressed terrorism issues within its borders and that the issuance of visas to aliens who are nationals of, or residing in, Yemen no longer poses a significant U.S. security threat.

Prohibits funds from being used to: (1) transfer an enemy combatant detained by the United States at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to any military or prison installation located in the United States; or (2) build or modify any facility in the United States for the purpose of housing any such enemy combatant.</summary>
