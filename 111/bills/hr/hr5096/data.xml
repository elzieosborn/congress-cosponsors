  <summary date="2010-04-30T16:45:52Z" status="Introduced in House">Diverse Teachers Recruitment Act of 2010 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) or nonprofits, educational service agencies, institutions of higher education, or states that enter into partnerships with such LEAs, for recruiting, training, and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups as public elementary and secondary school teachers.

Gives priority to LEAs that serve the most high-need schools and those that serve schools with the highest percentages of minorities in their student bodies.

Requires the Secretary to evaluate the success of the grantees and compile a database of best practices for recruiting, training, and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups as public elementary and secondary school teachers.</summary>
