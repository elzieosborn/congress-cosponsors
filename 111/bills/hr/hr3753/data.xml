  <summary date="2009-10-16T22:02:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Providing Resources to Improve Dual Language Education Act of 2009 or the PRIDE Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award up to five grants to partnerships of local educational agencies (LEAs), early childhood education programs, and technical assistance providers for the implementation of dual language demonstration programs designed to enhance and assess the biliteracy, bilingualism, and multicultural skills of low-income minority and limited English proficient students from preschool through grade five.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) arrange for an entity that has dual language program experience to provide technical assistance to LEA grantees and evaluate the programs funded by this Act; and (2) disseminate information on model practices implemented under such programs that are appropriate for use by early childhood education providers to improve the school readiness of limited English proficient students.</summary>
