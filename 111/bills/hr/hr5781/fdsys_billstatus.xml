Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to monitor such review. </p> <p>(Sec. 212) Requires the Administrator to designate an independent, nonprofit U.S. institution to manage the fundamental space life science and physical sciences and related technology research to be conducted on the ISS, as well as all research, including U.S. commercial research, that is funded by non-NASA U.S. domestic entities and that is carried out on the ISS. </p> <p>Instructs such designated research management institution to make recommendations to the Administrator for: (1) the selection, prioritization, and oversight of U.S. ISS research projects; (2) the establishment of a process for the governance of U.S. ISS research users; (3) the conduct of outreach and education to enhance use of the ISS; and (4) the provision of information on U.S. capabilities, research facilities, and resources associated with U.S. research use of the ISS. </p> <p>Authorizes other government agencies engaged in research and development to contract with such institution for the use of the ISS when it is beneficial in meeting their mission requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 213) Requires the institution designated under section 212 to prepare, for the Administrator, a U.S. ISS research management plan. </p> <p>(Sec. 214) Requires the Administrator to transmit to Congress a plan prepared by such institution for broadening and enhancing outreach for U.S. ISS research to potential U.S. government, academic, and commercial ISS users. </p> <p>(Sec. 215) Requires the Administrator to ensure the availability of ISS cargo resupply capacity to support the full and productive use and the extended operations of the ISS through 2020. Provides for an assessment of the capacity required to support enhanced research use and extended operations through that period. </p> <p>Instructs the Administrator to explore with ISS partners options to ensure the provision of needed upmass to and downmass from the ISS in the event that adequate commercial cargo resupply capabilities are unavailable during any extended period after the Space Shuttle is retired. Mandates the Administrator to certify to Congress that such U.S. or commercial capabilities are unavailable before relying on such partners to upmass or downmass cargo. </p> <p>(Sec. 216) Directs the Administrator carry out an assessment of innovative options for the deployment of a variable-gravity centrifuge on the ISS, which shall include the identification of: (1) the requirements for a variable-gravity centrifuge to support fundamental and applied research on the ISS; and (2) the potential for international collaboration and other potential partnerships or innovative acquisition approaches that could facilitate the deployment of a centrifuge facility for the ISS. </p> <p>(Sec. 217) Directs the Administrator to develop: (1) priorities for technology development activities that enable and support NASA's long-term plans for exploration beyond low-Earth orbit and that require the capabilities of the ISS; and (2) a plan for FY2011-FY2020 to carry out prioritized activities. </p> <p>(Sec. 218) Requires the development of a strategic plan to carry out fundamental space life science and physical sciences and related technology research, including research on the response of fluids and materials to reduced gravity environments that needs to be understood in developing exploration-related technologies and systems.</p> <p>Requires the Administrator to ensure that a responsible official is designated at NASA headquarters to lead an integrated basic and applied research program in such areas of research. </p> <p>Instructs the Administrator, as part of the annual NASA fiscal year budget request, to: (1) include a description of the ground-based, free-flyer, and ISS life and microgravity science research that is being carried out which is not directly related to supporting the human exploration programand identify the percentage of the total research budget for ISS research that such research represents; and (2) identify the programs proposed for carrying out research activities on the ISS and the proposed funding to support those programs. </p> <p><b>Subtitle C: Space Shuttle </b>- (Sec. 221) Expresses the sense of the Congress that it is very important, in view of the extension of the life of the ISS until at least 2020, for the space shuttle fleet to leave the ISS in the best possible configuration for the post-shuttle era. Instructs NASA to ensure the continued viability of the ISS in the event that there are delays in the delivery or the inability to deliver critical parts and supplies once the shuttle is retired. </p> <p>Authorizes the Administrator to conduct one additional space shuttle mission to the ISS beyond the missions in the flight manifest as of February 2010 if an additional Space Shuttle mission is a useful and necessary step in reducing the risks to the operation and use of the ISS that are associated with the retirement of the Shuttle fleet and if specified conditions have been certified by the Administrator as having been met. </p> <p>Provides, in the event that the additional Shuttle flight to the ISS is authorized, for contingent funding for the incremental costs associated with the additional mission.</p> <p>(Sec. 222) Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 to re-designate the Space Shuttle Transition Liaison Office as the Post-Shuttle Transition Liaison Office and to terminate such Office two years after the final grant under the Post-Shuttle Workforce Transition Initiative Grant Program is awarded. </p> <p>(Sec. 223) Authorizes the Administrator, through the Post-Shuttle Transition Liaison Office, to make grants for the establishment of aerospace workforce and community transition strategies. </p> <p>Permits the transfer of amounts made available under this section to other federal agencies for the purpose of assisting in the transition of aerospace workers and communities adversely affected by the termination of the Space Shuttle program. </p> <p>Requires recipients of such grants to use the funds made available through the grant to: (1) conduct community and business outreach; (2) implement regional revitalization and facilities reuse strategies; (3) support entrepreneurship and new business development initiatives; and (4) support workforce retraining. </p> <p>(Sec. 224) Sets forth requirements for the decommissioning of the remaining space shuttles.
