Prohibits an officer from being compelled to submit to the use of a lie detector. Sets forth requirements and procedures for conducting disciplinary proceedings and for protecting the personal records and property of an officer.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize federal control over any state or local police force or criminal justice agency."
