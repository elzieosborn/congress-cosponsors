Prohibits redistribution of unused allotments.\n\nReauthorizes the SCHIP program through FY2014 at increased levels.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to eligible entities to improve outreach to and enrollment of eligible children.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) a limited tax credit for qualified health insurance for any dependent child; and (2) advance payment to insurance providers of health insurance credit for purchasers of such insurance.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a State Health Coverage Innovation Commission to make grants to states for innovative health reform projects.\n\nDirects the Secretary to implement administrative reforms with respect to the Medicare and Medicaid programs sufficient to result in projected reductions in the Medicare and Medicaid federal budget baselines for FY2010-2015 that exceed the projected revenue loss for the same period attributable to the tax credit provided for, and the increase in the federal budget baseline for SCHIP resulting from, this Act."
