  <summary date="2010-05-04T16:26:45Z" status="Introduced in House">STRONG Budget Act of 2010 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to require a second, general sequestration within 15 days after the end of any session of Congress if, first, a particular sequestration occurs at that time under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. Requires the general sequestration to equal 2% of the budget baseline for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the calendar year during which such sequestration occurs.

Prohibits such sequestration order from reducing: (1) benefits payable under title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA); (2) annuities payable to certain employees under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974; (3) benefits payable under any program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans (28-0401-0-1-701); (4) benefits payable under SSA title IV part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) relating to hospital insurance benefits for the aged and disabled; (5) payments for net interest (all of major functional category 900); and (6) other specified federal retirement and disability accounts.

Requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), within 14 days after the end of a session, to issue an annual deficit reduction report and, if the report requires a sequestration, to prepare and the President to issue a sequestration order reducing nonexempt accounts by enough to eliminate the deficit. Prohibits such reduction, however, from exceeding 2% of the total amount of such nonexempt accounts.

Provides for: (1) suspension of such sequestration procedures if OMB determines that the federal budget is not in deficit; and (2) restoration of such procedures in the first fiscal year after OMB determines there is a deficit.



Amends Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit legislation carrying an additional exemption to sequestrations under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act (and this Act) from being considered as passed or agreed to unless by a vote of at least three-fifths of the Members.</summary>
