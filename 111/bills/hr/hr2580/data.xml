  <summary date="2009-08-14T19:37:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Empowering Medicare Patient Choices Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) contract with an entity to establish consensus-based standards to certify patient decision aids; and (2) establish an expert panel to make recommendations about which patient decision aids should be implemented, appropriate training for health care providers on patient decision aids and shared decision making, and appropriate quality measures for use in the related pilot program

Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program to provide for the phased-in development, implementation, and evaluation of shared decision making under the Medicare program using patient decision aids to improve beneficiary understanding of medical treatment options.

Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance for establishment of Shared Decision Making Resource Centers to support adoption, implementation, and effective use of patient decision aids and shared decision making by eligible Medicare providers.

Specifies the medical conditions for approved patient decision aids

Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary to promulgate regulations that: (1) specify for which preference-sensitive conditions beneficiaries should participate in shared decision making; (2) require service providers and suppliers to make sure that beneficiaries receive appropriate patient decision aids; and (3) specify a process for beneficiaries to elect not to use such patient decision aids.

Prescribes a penalty for service providers or item suppliers if a patient does not receive a patient decision aid before an item or service is furnished, unless the patient has elected not to use such an aid.</summary>
