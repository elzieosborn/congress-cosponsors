    "text": "Coal Ash Reclamation, Environment, and Safety Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations that: (1) establish design, engineering, and performance standards that provide for safe storage and disposal of covered wastes in impoundments; and (2) contain requirements that are substantially similar to the requirements that apply to impoundments under provisions in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 concerning environmental protection performance standards for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and standards and criteria for coal mine waste piles. Prohibits persons from constructing or operating impoundments for the storage or disposal of covered wastes on any land in any state except as in accordance with such regulations.\n\nProvides for the monitoring and enforcement of such requirements and prohibitions.\n\nRequires the Secretary to complete an inventory of existing impoundments for the deposit and maintenance of covered wastes. Authorizes the Secretary to issue orders necessary to ensure that impoundments comply with requirements.\n\nDefines the term \"covered wastes\" to mean wastes in areas other than the mine working or excavations, including coal ash, slag, and flue gas desulfurization materials stored or disposed of in liquid, semi-liquid, or solid form."
