  <summary date="2009-03-27T19:31:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to exempt certain all-terrain vehicles from children's product lead limits if it finds that compliance is not technologically feasible due to certain parts that are required for safety or functionality.

Allows the CPSC to exempt a specific product or material from the limits if it finds that lead in the product or material will not result in the absorption of lead (under current law, of any lead) into the human body, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product by a child.</summary>
