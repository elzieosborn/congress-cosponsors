  <summary date="2009-08-11T20:15:37Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving Communication with Consumers During Food Recall Act of 2009 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include among prohibited acts the failure to comply with an order regarding the recall of food.

Sets forth provisions governing any voluntary or mandatory recall of adulterated or misbranded food that could result in illness or injury if consumed. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to require any food retailer: (1) to inform the Secretary regarding whether the retailer has a system for identifying persons who purchased the food; and (2) if so, to issue a recall notice to those persons. Requires the notice to be made in such manner and to contain such information as the Secretary may require and to be issued by the retailer or by a third party selected by the retailer.

Directs the Secretary, upon requiring a retailer to issue a recall notice for food, to: (1) identify the manufacturers, importers, distributors, or other persons that most likely caused the adulteration or misbranding; and (2) require such persons to reimburse the retailer for any costs incurred to comply with an order issued under this Act.</summary>
