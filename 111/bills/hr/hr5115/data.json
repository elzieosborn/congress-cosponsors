    "text": "FSS Retirement Fairness Act of 2010 - Allows certain flight service station (FSS) controllers, employed by Department of Transportation (DOT), to elect to treat qualified service in the same manner as if it had been performed as an FSS controller for purposes of determining eligibility for immediate retirement and computation of annuity under either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS).\n\nLimits the application of this Act, with specified exclusions, to FSS controllers who were separated from government service (other than for cause), or were transferred from an FSS controller position to a different government position (other than as an air traffic controller), during the period from February 1-October 3, 2005, and had completed at least five years of qualified service (as an employee of a contractor or an otherwise creditable position other than as an air traffic controller) as of the date of such separation or reassignment.\n\nRequires certain individuals who make such election to make contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund with respect to qualified service performed after the effective date of such election.\n\nPrescribes special rules relating to: (1) immediate retirement, including continued enrollment in a Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan; and (2) recomputation of the annuity of any individual (or survivor) otherwise excluded from application of this Act because of entitlement to a CSRS or a FERS annuity based on the individual's government service."
