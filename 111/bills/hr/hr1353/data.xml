States that transactions involving the initial disposition by an approved seller of pooled certificates acquired by the seller from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac upon the initial issuance of the pooled certificates shall be deemed to be transactions by a person other than as an issuer, underwriter, or dealer within the meaning of the laws administered by the SEC.

Defines pooled certificates as single class mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that have been issued by Fannie or Freddie directly to the approved seller in exchange for the mortgage loans underlying such mortgage-backed securities.

Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt specified applicants filing a securities registration statement subject to a fee from being required to pay aggregate fees in excess of 5% of the target offsetting collection amount for the fiscal year.
