  <summary date="2009-11-24T21:33:32Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Modifies the boundaries of Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado, to exclude from it a parcel of real property consisting of approximately seven acres that was erroneously included within the Crystal Lakes Subdivision, North Filing, as a result of the failure of a 1975 survey of the Subdivision to correctly locate the original quarter corners as specified.

Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to use the authority provided by the Small Tracts Act to convey all interest of the United States in and to the real property excluded from the boundaries of Roosevelt National Forest under this Act to the landowners whose real property adjoins the excluded land and who have occupied the excluded land in good faith reliance on the erroneous survey.

Reduces by a specified amount, and cancels the amount so reduced, the amount available for obligation from the unobligated balance in the special account for the deposit and expenditure of fees and revenues established for the Forest Service under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act.</summary>
