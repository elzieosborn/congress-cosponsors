    "text": "National Windstorm Impact Reduction Reauthorization Act of 2009 - Amends the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 to revise provisions governing the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program.\n\nDesignates the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the lead agency for Program planning, management, and coordination. Establishes the Interagency Working Group on Wind Impact Reduction (IWG) to coordinate activities and facilitate communication among Program agencies in reducing the impacts of windstorms. (Repeals provisions regarding the existing Interagency Working Group responsible for Program planning, management, and coordination.)\n\nRequires the Director of NIST to: (1) establish a Program Office to provide planning, management, and coordination functions; (2) facilitate preparation of a coordinated annual crosscut budget and report for the Program; (3) facilitate preparation of the IWG's biennial report to Congress and the National Science and Technology Council; (4) support research and development for building codes and standards; (5) promote implementation of research results; (6) support deployment of interagency teams to investigate major windstorm events and data collection and analysis; (7) support the organization and deployment of interagency teams to investigate major windstorm events and the gathering, publishing, and archiving of collected data and analysis results; and (8) participate in, coordinate, or support other Program mitigation activities.\n\nSets forth the duties of the Program Office (including ensuring coordination and synergy across Program agencies) and of the IWG (including preparation of an interim working plan for Program operations and a strategic plan for achieving Program objectives).\n\nIncludes the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Army Corps of Engineers as Program agencies.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for the Program for FY2010-FY2014."
