  <summary date="2009-05-20T14:47:56Z" status="Introduced in House">Secondary School Innovation Fund Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to establish a Secondary School Innovation Fund program awarding competitive matching grants to partnerships, which must include at least one state or local educational agency, for the implementation of innovative strategies to improve the achievement of at-risk students in secondary schools. Permits partnerships to award subgrants to schools for the implementation of such strategies.

Lists innovative strategies, one or more of which grantees or subgrantees must implement, that include: (1) creating multiple education pathways that offer students a range of educational options aligned with their needs and interests and preparing them for postsecondary education and the workforce; (2) giving students access to early college high school or other dual enrollment learning opportunities; (3) using secondary school early warning indicators and intervention systems attuned to the needs of at-risk students; (4) creating expanded learning time opportunities; (5) improving student transitions from middle school to high school or from high school to postsecondary education and the workforce; (6) increasing the autonomy and flexibility of secondary schools; (7) improving rural education through educational technology; (8) improving learning opportunities for students in the middle grades; (9) improving teaching and increasing academic rigor at the secondary school level; and (10) improving community and parental involvement in students' education.

Requires the Secretary to disseminate, and provide technical assistance regarding, best practices in improving secondary school student achievement.</summary>
