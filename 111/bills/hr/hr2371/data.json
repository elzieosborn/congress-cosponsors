Requires any emission allowances that are not sold within one year of receipt to be returned to the Administrator, who shall distribute them to the remaining states ratably in accordance with the formula.\n\nRequires states to use the proceeds from such sales exclusively for the benefit of consumers of home heating oil or propane for residential or commercial purposes, particularly: (1) cost-effective energy efficiency programs; or (2) rebates or other direct financial assistance programs for them."
