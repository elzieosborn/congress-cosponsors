Provides that a certification or a renewal shall expire after three years.\n\nExempts such a certified photograph from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but does not preclude voluntary disclosure.\n\nOPEN FOIA Act of 2009 - Amends FOIA to require statutory exemptions to its disclosure requirements to specifically cite its provision that authorizes such exemptions."
