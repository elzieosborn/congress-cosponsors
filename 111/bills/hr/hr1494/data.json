Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to allow the President to provide reimbursement to private for-profit nursing homes for damages and expenses from a major disaster or emergency. Requires that such nursing homes: (1) be located within 30 miles of the disaster or emergency; and (2) have acted during the disaster or emergency in accordance with any relevant requirements applicable to private nonprofit nursing homes seeking reimbursement. Limits the amount of reimbursement to not greater than the amount available under such Act to a public or private nonprofit nursing home for similar damages or expenses after a disaster or emergency."
