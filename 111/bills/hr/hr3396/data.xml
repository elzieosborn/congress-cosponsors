  <summary date="2009-09-25T15:19:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Congressional Responsibility and Accountability Act - Amends the Administrative Procedure Act to: (1) require each agency, before adopting a rule, to determine whether compliance with the rule will result in a specified economic impact; and (2) prohibit an agency from enforcing a rule it determines will result in such impact until its requirements are enacted into law.

Requires each agency: (1) annually, to determine whether its rules have resulted in a specified economic impact in the preceding year; and (2) not later than 365 days after making such determination, to no longer enforce such a rule until its requirements are enacted into law.

Defines "specified economic impact" as: (1) costs to any individual of $5,000 or more in a year; (2) costs to any partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization of $10,000 or more in a year; (3) costs to all persons (not including the federal government or a state government) in the aggregate of $25,000 or more in a year; or (4) the loss by one or more U.S. citizens of existing employment in a year.</summary>
