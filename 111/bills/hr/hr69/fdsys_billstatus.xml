        <text><![CDATA[ <p>No One Strike Eviction Act of 2009 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise the requirement that a public housing agency (PHA) establish administrative grievance procedures for one strike evictions of tenants from public and federally assisted housing for violent or drug-related criminal activity on or off such premises, or any activity resulting in a felony conviction.</p> <p>Requires the PHA or other reviewing body, during such procedures, to consider all mitigating circumstances and the impact of such actions upon the family and dependents of that person.</p> <p>Exempts a tenant from eviction or denial or termination of a tenancy based solely upon such individual's familial relationship to a person who has been convicted of a criminal offense.</p> <p>Amends the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 to modify tenant requirements for PHA programs or federally assisted housing to make only an individual ineligible (currently, the entire household with the individual) if such individual is an illegal drug user or alcohol abuser.</p> <p>Authorizes a PHA or owner to deny criminal offenders admission to such programs or housing, but not other members of the offender's household.</p> <p>Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to exempt a tenant in public housing or housing assisted under the voucher program or any other section 8 rental assistance program from eviction for criminal or drug-related activity engaged in by a member of a tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, if: (1) the tenant did not know and should not have known of the activity; or (2) the tenant, a member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control was the victim of criminal activity.</p>]]></text>
