  <summary date="2009-06-08T18:51:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Wellness Trust Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish the Wellness Trust within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Requires the Trustees to submit to Congress and make publicly available reports on: (1) a certification system for prevention health workers; (2) payment methodologies and options for paying certified prevention health workers for clinical preventive care; and (3) the amount of money spent on prevention during the most recent year for which such data is available.

Requires the Trustees to: (1) establish a plan for delivering and financing prevention priorities and implementing pilot programs; and (2) issue and annually update a ranked list of designated prevention priorities based on the potential of an activity to improve health and the activity's cost effectiveness.

Directs the Trustees to establish and sustain the infrastructure for an effective wellness system that includes: (1) an information clearinghouse on prevention priorities and community-based interventions; (2) use and integration of qualified electronic health records; and (3) a system for training and credentialing prevention health workers and prevention health entities.

Establishes in the Treasury a Wellness Trust Fund.

Requires the Trust to reimburse certified prevention health workers and prevention health entities for the prevention services and community-based interventions designated by the Trustees as prevention priorities.

Revises the definition of "qualified electronic health record" to require such a record to have the capacity to track the provision of prevention health care over the course of an individual's lifetime and assist in the evaluation of the efficacy of designated prevention priorities.

 Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to support the integration of prevention health priorities, health data, and tracking of the provision of preventive care by means of qualified electronic health records.</summary>
