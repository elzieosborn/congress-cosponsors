  <summary date="2009-08-10T21:11:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Vehicles for the Future Act - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to establish standards for electric utilities regarding electric vehicle infrastructure. Requires electric utilities to develop a plan to support the use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles that provides for the deployment of electrical charging stations and charging infrastructure.

Directs each state regulatory authority (in the case of each electric utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each utility (in the case of a nonregulated utility) to: (1) require that infrastructure deployed is interoperable with products of all manufactures; (2) establish protocols and standards for integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles into an electrical distribution system, including smart grid systems and devices; (3) include the ability of each vehicle to be identified individually and to be associated with its owner's electric utility account; and (4) review their determinations on time-based metering and communications.

Sets forth provisions concerning compliance with such standards.</summary>
