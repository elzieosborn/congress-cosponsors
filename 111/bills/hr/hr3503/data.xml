  <summary date="2009-12-07T16:27:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Salmon Solutions and Planning Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences for scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery efforts, including a review of Snake River dam removal (Washington state) and other actions necessary to achieve recovery of endangered or threatened salmon and steelhead populations of the Columbia and Snake River Basin.

Directs: (1) the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a peer-reviewed analysis of which rail, highway, and Columbia River barge infrastructure improvements would be necessary to ensure a cost-effective and efficient transportation system for shippers who currently use barge transportation between Lewiston, Idaho, and the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers and who would be unable to do so if the four lower Snake River dams were removed; (2) the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to conduct a peer-reviewed analysis of options to replace the power currently generated by such dams if they were removed; (3) the Army Corps of Engineers to analyze riverfront revitalization and restoration opportunities and costs in the event of such removal; and (4) the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to conduct a peer-reviewed analysis of the options and costs regarding any needed modifications to affected irrigation systems, cooling systems, and private wells if the dams were removed.

 Sets forth the congressional determination that the Secretary of the Army may remove the four lower Snake River dams.

Directs the Secretary to reevaluate and update the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Final Lower Snake River Juvenile Salmon Migration Feasibility Report/Environmental Impact Statement (February 2002) pursuant to new information.</summary>
