  <summary date="2009-02-11T21:18:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Requires the Secretary of Energy to: (1) expand the Energy Star program to include the certification of buildings as green buildings; and (2) study and make recommendations concerning the streamlining of the certification process, development of an online certification program, and design of a program allowing certification by those without green building expertise.

Defines "green building" as a building constructed taking into account sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, indoor environmental quality, life-cycle concerns of building materials (including emissions and environmental impact), and transit and density-oriented development.

Requires a report to Congress setting forth the design of the expanded program.</summary>
