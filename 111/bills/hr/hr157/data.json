Limits the District to one Member under any reapportionment of Members.\n\nModifies the formula regarding the number of presidential electors to subject it to the 23rd amendment to the Constitution in the case of the District.\n\nIncreases membership of the House from 435 to 437 Members.\n\nProvides for a reapportionment of Members resulting from such increase.\n\nDirects the Clerk of the House to: (1) certify to the Governor of each state the number of Representatives to which the state is entitled; and (2) identify to the Speaker of the House the state (other than the District of Columbia) entitled to one additional Representative."
