    "text": "Support Investment Protection for Customers Reform Act of 2009 - Amends the Securities Investor Protection Act to increase from $100,000 to $250,000 (with inflation adjustments) the amount of an investor's net equity claim for cash that the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) (a nonprofit, nongovernment, membership corporation funded by its broker-dealer members) insures in the event the investor's broker-dealer becomes insolvent.\n\nIncreases the federal line of credit available to the SIPC.\n\nIncreases from $150 to $1,000 the minimum annual assessment paid by SIPC members.\n\nAllows the SIPC to appoint itself or one of its employees as trustee, without regard to the amount of liabilities to unsecured general creditors and to subordinated lenders involved, if there appear to be fewer than 5,000 (currently 500) customers of a broker-dealer member facing liquidation.\n\nProhibits SIPC advances to the insiders of failed or failing broker-dealers.\n\nRaises the aggregate customer claim limit on the SIPC's authority to use the direct payment procedure rather than instituting a liquidation proceeding with regard to failed or failing members.\n\nIncreases the maximum fine imposed on SIPC members that engage in certain prohibited acts.\n\nEstablishes civil liability and criminal penalties for misrepresentations of SIPC membership or protection.\n\nCreates, within the Office of Inspector General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a Commission on International Financial Fraud to study the potential structure of, and benefits of establishing, an international financial court and process for the adjudication of financial fraud cases."
