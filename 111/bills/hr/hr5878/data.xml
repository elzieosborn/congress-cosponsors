Requires any entity that uses such funds for a golf course to: (1) submit to the Comptroller General a report which describes baseline data on existing jobs and diversity of the golf course and related businesses and provides detailed information on jobs created; and (2) institute a diversity plan for the golf course and related businesses and establish objective conduct for recruiting women, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and individuals with disabilities for entry, mid-management, and senior executive positions. Requires the Comptroller General to report on the use of any funds for golf courses as a result of this Act.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to remove commercial golf courses from property for which specified Gulf Opportunity Zone tax benefits are not available.</summary>
