  <summary date="2010-12-08T13:47:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to submit to Congress and make publicly available on an Internet website the total number of: (1) jobs, performed by both DOD civilian employees and contractors, in each state and at each military installation; and (2) DOD functions converted from performance by contractors to performance by DOD civilian employees in each state and at each military installation, as well as the task area of each function. Requires the Secretary to make publicly available the comparison of the cost of performance of each DOD function so converted.

Allows any small business that performs a DOD function that is converted to performance by DOD civilian employees and, by reason of that conversion, loses 33% or more of its revenue generated through contracts or 33% or more of its employees, to appeal such conversion to the inspector general of the military department concerned or to the Secretary.</summary>
