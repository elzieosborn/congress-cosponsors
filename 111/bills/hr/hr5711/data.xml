 Authorizes the President to invite each U.S. territory to provide and furnish a statue, in marble or bronze, of a deceased person who has been a citizen of such territory, and illustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services, such as the territory may deem to be worthy of this national commemoration. Requires the statues to be placed in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol.

 Prohibits a statue of any individual from being placed in Statuary Hall until 10 years after the individual's death.

Prescribes requirements and administrative procedures for replacement of such statues.</summary>
