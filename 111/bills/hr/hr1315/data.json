Provides for the disposition of other detainees after status reviews, including possible release.\n\nRepeals the prohibition on habeaus corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the judicial review of all applications for writs of habeas corpus brought by detainees that are pending as of the date of enactment of this Act should be suspended until the completion of the status reviews.\n\nRepeals the Military Commissions Act of 2006.\n\nRequires the President to report to Congress any recommendations for statutory changes necessary to implement a comprehensive federal policy governing the apprehension, detention, trial, transfer, release, or other disposition of individuals captured or apprehended in connection with armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations."
