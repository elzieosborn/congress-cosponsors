Directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide for the long-term stewardship of environmental data.\n\n(Sec. 104) Requires a report every five years to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives regarding all strategy implementation activities.\n\n(Sec. 105) Allows the Coral Reef Conservation Fund to be used to address emergency response actions.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to: (1) make community-based planning grants for increased protection of high priority coral reefs; (2) maintain an inventory of all vessel grounding incidents involving coral reefs; (3) identify all coral reefs with a high incidence of vessel impacts; and (4) identify measures to reduce such impacts.\n\nDirects the Secretary to submit an international coral reef ecosystem strategy to specified congressional committees.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to establish an international coral reef ecosystem partnership program to provide support, including funding and technical assistance, for activities that implement the strategy. Requires that priority be given to regional initiatives and projects that states are participating in with other nations.\n\nAuthorizes issuance of research permits and the assessment of related fees.\n\nRequires coral reef conservation programs and projects to be applied in accordance with international law.\n\n(Sec. 107) Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014 to the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to carry out the Act.\n\nTitle II: United States Coral Reef Task Force - (Sec. 201) Establishes the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force to coordinate federal actions regarding such ecosystems.\n\nTitle III: Department of the Interior Coral Reef Authorities - (Sec. 301) Amends the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act to include in the definition of \"wildlife\" and \"wildlife resources\" coral reef ecosystems located in the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, or any Marine National Monument designated under the Act popularly known as the Antiquities Act. Requires, regarding authorities under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 and the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978, that references to \"wildlife\" and \"fish and wildlife\" be construed to include such ecosystems located in those systems or any such monument.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of the Interior, subject to appropriations, to provide financial assistance for coral reef conservation."
