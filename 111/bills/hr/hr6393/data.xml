  <summary date="2010-10-27T18:29:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Community Options for Regulatory Equity Act of 2010 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require states exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems to exempt any nonprofit or municipal small public water system (serving 10,000 or fewer persons) that so requests in accordance with this Act from the requirements of any national primary drinking water regulation for naturally occurring contaminants, including arsenic, radon, radium, uranium, any microbial pathogen (including Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia), and any contaminant that is a disinfection byproduct (including bromate, chlorite, haloacetic acids, and total trihalomethanes).

Requires exemption requests to include a finding that the system's compliance with applicable national primary drinking water regulations is not economically feasible. Precludes judicial or administrative review of such findings.</summary>
