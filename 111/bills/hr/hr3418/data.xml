  <summary date="2009-10-09T21:23:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Prescription Drug Cost Equalization Act - Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require application to specialty tier drugs (very high cost and unique items) of the process for exception from the tiered cost-sharing for drugs included within a formulary.

(Under an exception, a nonpreferred drug could be covered under the terms applicable for preferred drugs if the prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug for treatment of the same condition either would not be as effective for the individual, or would have adverse effects for the individual, or both.)</summary>
