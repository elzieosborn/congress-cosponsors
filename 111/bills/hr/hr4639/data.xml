  <summary date="2010-04-13T16:12:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Corporal Dustin Lee Memorial Act - Provides that, for purposes of determining the appropriateness of the adoption of a military working dog (dog) before the end of the dog's useful life, the unusual or extraordinary circumstances that must exist in such case may include situations in which the handler is killed in action, dies of wounds received in action, or is so seriously wounded in action that the member will, or most likely will, receive a medical discharge. Provides that, under such circumstances, if the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that an adoption is justified, the dog will be made available for adoption only by the immediate family of such member.</summary>
