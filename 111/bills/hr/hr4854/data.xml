  <summary date="2010-04-28T21:39:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Home Inspection Act of 2010 - Requires the federal banking agencies to prescribe joint regulations to prohibit any lender from making any federally related mortgage loan, under which a home inspection is conducted in connection with settlement of such loan, unless such inspection is conducted by a home inspector who is licensed, certified, approved, or otherwise regulated by the inspector's home state or the state in which the real property is located.



 Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to include in the HUD-1 settlement form: (1) an item for identifying any home inspection conducted in connection with the settlement; (2) when such inspection was or is to be completed; (3) the inspection's cost; (4) whether the charge for such inspection is imposed on the borrower or the seller; and (5) whether such charge has been paid before settlement and a copy of such receipt is included with the settlement documents.</summary>
