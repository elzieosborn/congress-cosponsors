  <summary date="2010-05-22T15:46:21Z" status="Passed House amended">Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2010 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to increase payments to states under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program for implementing a minimum or an enhanced DNA collection process. Increases such payments by 5% for states that implement a minimum DNA collection process and by 10% for states that implement an enhanced DNA process.

Defines "minimum DNA collection process" as a process under which the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is searched at least one time against samples of individuals who are at least 18 years of age and who are arrested for, charged with, or indicted for crimes involving murder, manslaughter, sexual assaults, and kidnapping or abduction.

Defines "enhanced DNA collection process" as a process under which states provide for the collection, for purposes of inclusion in CODIS, of DNA samples from individuals who are at least 18 years of age and who are arrested or charged with crimes involving murder, manslaughter, sexual assault, certain sexual offenses involving a minor, burglary, and aggravated assault.

Directs the Attorney General to submit to the Judiciary Committees of Congress an annual report: (1) listing states which have (and which have not) implemented a minimum or enhanced DNA collection process and which use such processes; (2) describing the increases in grant payments to states; and (3) including statistics on benefits to law enforcement resulting from the implementation of minimum and enhanced DNA collection processes.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015.</summary>
