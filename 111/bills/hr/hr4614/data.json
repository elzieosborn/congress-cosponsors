Increases such payments by 5% for states that implement a minimum DNA collection process and by 10% for states that implement an enhanced DNA process.\n\nDefines \"minimum DNA collection process\" as a process under which the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is searched at least one time against samples of individuals who are at least 18 years of age and who are arrested for, charged with, or indicted for crimes involving murder, manslaughter, sexual assaults, and kidnapping or abduction.\n\nDefines \"enhanced DNA collection process\" as a process under which states provide for the collection, for purposes of inclusion in CODIS, of DNA samples from individuals who are at least 18 years of age and who are arrested or charged with crimes involving murder, manslaughter, sexual assault, certain sexual offenses involving a minor, burglary, and aggravated assault.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to submit to the Judiciary Committees of Congress an annual report: (1) listing states which have (and which have not) implemented a minimum or enhanced DNA collection process and which use such processes; (2) describing the increases in grant payments to states; and (3) including statistics on benefits to law enforcement resulting from the implementation of minimum and enhanced DNA collection processes.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015."
