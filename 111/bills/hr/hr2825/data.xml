  <summary date="2009-08-07T19:42:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Safety in Defense Contracting Act - Requires the Secretary of Defense to debar from contracting with the Department of Defense (DOD) any defense contractor: (1) officially determined to have caused serious injury or death to any civilian or military personnel through gross negligence or reckless disregard for safety, or to have committed fraud; or (2) awarded a subcontract to a subcontractor officially determined to have caused or committed such actions. Directs the Secretary to also debar any subcontractor found to have caused or committed such actions.

Requires a five-year minimum period for such a debarment.

Authorizes a debarment waiver by the Secretary if it would jeopardize national security.

Directs the Secretary, in the case of any defense contractor receiving a level III corrective action request from the Defense Contract Management Agency in a fiscal year, to withhold any contract award or incentive fees for that fiscal year.</summary>
