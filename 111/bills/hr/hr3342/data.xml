Authorizes New Mexico and Santa Fe County, in agreement with the Pueblos, the city of Santa Fe, and other signatories to the Cost-Sharing and System Integration Agreement (that describes the location, capacity, and management of the regional water system and allocates system costs), to modify the extent, size, and capacity of the County Distribution System.

(Sec. 102) Sets deadlines for: (1) the Pueblos and the County to submit to the Secretary an executed operating agreement for the regional water system; and (2) the Secretary to approve such agreement.

(Sec. 104) States that the regional water system shall have the capacity to divert from the Rio Grande a quantity of water sufficient to provide: (1) up to 4,000 acre-feet of consumptive use of water; and (2) the requisite peaking capacity described in the engineering report and the final project design.

(Sec. 105) Establishes in the Treasury the Aamodt Settlement Pueblos' Fund.

(Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to comply with each federal law relating to environmental protection.

Title II: Pojoaque Basin Indian Water Rights Settlement - (Sec. 201) Authorizes, ratifies, and confirms the settlement agreement and the Cost-Sharing and System Integration Agreement.

(Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary to publish by September 15, 2017, a statement of finding that specified conditions have been fulfilled, including the following: (1) to the extent that the settlement agreement conflicts with this title, it has been revised to conform with this title; (2) the revised agreement has been executed by the appropriate parties and the Secretary; (3) Congress has fully appropriated, or the Secretary has provided from other authorized sources, all funds authorized in title I, with an exception, by December 15, 2016; (4) the Secretary has acquired and entered into appropriate contracts for the water rights described in that title; (5) permits have been issued by the New Mexico State Engineer to the Regional Water Authority to change the points of diversion to the mainstem of the Rio Grande for the diversion and consumptive use of at least 2,381 acre-feet by the Pueblos as part of the water supply for the regional water system, subject to specified conditions; (6) the state of New Mexico has enacted any necessary legislation and provided any funding that may be required under the settlement agreement; (7) a partial final decree that sets forth the water rights and other rights to water to which the Pueblos are entitled under the agreement and this title and that substantially conforms to the agreement has been approved by the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico; and (8) a final decree that sets forth the water rights for all parties to the Aamodt Case and that substantially conforms to the agreement has been approved by that Court by June 15, 2017.

Sets forth criteria for substantial completion of the regional water system. Requires the Secretary, at the request of one or more of the Pueblos, on or after June 30, 2021, to: (1) consult with the Pueblos and confer with Santa Fe County and New Mexico on whether the criteria for substantial completion of the system will be met by June 30, 2024; and (2) determine whether the system has been substantially completed and submit a written notice of such determination to the Pueblos, the County, and the state. Provides that such determination shall be considered to be a final agency action subject to judicial review by the Decree Court.

Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the failure to make a timely determination; (2) the right to void a final decree; and (3) the voiding of waivers.
