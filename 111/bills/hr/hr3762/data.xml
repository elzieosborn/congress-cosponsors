  <summary date="2010-03-01T21:50:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Congressional Research Service Electronic Accessibility Act of 2009 - Directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate, working jointly with the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), to establish and maintain a centralized, searchable, electronic database consisting of: (1) CRS Issue Briefs, Reports, and Authorization of Appropriations Products and Appropriations Products; and (2) an index of such information. Exempts: (1) any information determined to be confidential by the CRS Director or the head of the agency that provided it to CRS; and (2) any document that is the product of a confidential research request made by a House or Senate Member, officer, employee, or office.

Authorizes the Clerk and the Secretary, on the basis of information provided by the Director, to: (1) remove from the database information about a CRS employee or material that may infringe the copyright of a protected work; and (2) make any changes that the Director determines are necessary to ensure that information in the database is accurate and current.

Requires each official public website of a Member or committee of Congress to permit public use to obtain the information contained in such database to the same extent congressional users may obtain such information through the CRS website.

Provides that this Act does not require the Director to respond to any public inquiry with respect to information in the database.</summary>
