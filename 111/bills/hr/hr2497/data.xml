  <summary date="2011-03-25T15:39:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Transportation Job Corps Act of 2009 - Requires the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to establish: (1) a National Joint Workforce Development Council; and (2) regional workforce development councils and governing boards in each of its 10 regions. Replaces the current discretionary grant and contract programs addressing human resource needs as they apply to public transportation activities.

Directs the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator, to establish programs for the award of grants to: (1) nonprofit organizations and educational institutions to introduce disconnected youth (ages 16 through 24 who are out of school and unemployed) to careers in the transit industry by providing them with basic skills education and pre-apprenticeship skills; (2) partnerships of transit agencies and unions representing non-managerial employees (partnerships), as well as providers of management and technical programs for managerial employees, to develop education programs to improve job skills of transit employees and to provide education and training to assist individuals to enter the transit profession; and (3) the same or similar partnerships to develop special projects to increase education opportunities for disadvantaged transit industry individuals, including racial and ethnic minorities underrepresented in transit management, by providing student scholarships, pre-entry preparation, and retention activities.</summary>
