    "text": "Energy Efficient Manufactured Housing Act of 2009 - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to make grants to state agencies responsible for developing state energy conservation plans under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide owners of manufactured homes constructed prior to 1976 rebates to use toward purchases of new Energy Star qualified manufactured homes. \n\n Restricts rebates to owners of manufactured homes that are used on a year-round basis as a primary residence and that will be destroyed (including appropriate recycling) and replaced, in the same general location, with an Energy Star qualified manufactured home. Limits rebates to: (1) one owner per household; (2) households with total incomes not exceeding 200% of the federal poverty level in the applicable area; and (3) $7,500 per manufactured home.\n\nDirects the Secretary to seek to achieve the purpose of this Act through similar federal programs, including: (1) the Weatherization Assistance Program; and (2) the Department of Energy\u0092s (DOE\u0092s) State Energy Program."
