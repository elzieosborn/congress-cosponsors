    "text": "Knowledge and Innovation for the Next Generation of Learning Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Education to establish the National Center for Knowledge Use (Center) within the Institute of Education Sciences to foster and support the use of scientifically valid education research to improve academic instruction and lifelong learning.\n\nRequires the Center to establish a Developing What Works Venture Fund program that awards competitive grants to entities that develop, bring to scale, and disseminate educational innovations based on scientifically valid research.\n\nDirects the Center to provide grants to states to employ corps of Chief Knowledge Officers that connect educators and administrators with research-based solutions to the most critical problems of practice in local educational agencies and chronically low-performing schools. Makes each state's share of the grant funds equivalent to its share of school improvement funds under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n\nEstablishes the National Leadership Office for Research to Innovation in the Department of Education to: (1) ensure that educational practices, policies, and investments based on scientifically valid research are brought to scale and fully coordinated across the federal government; (2) encourage the use of new technologies in appropriate research-based educational efforts; (3) support the effective coordination of federally supported education research programs; and (4) promote the coordinated administration of research-based education programs and services by means of an interagency task force."
