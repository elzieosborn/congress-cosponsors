Exempts a person who establishes a guaranty, signed by the person residing in the United States from whom the food was received in good faith, that the food does not contain any cloned product.\n\nAllows a person to commence a civil action against a person who is alleged to have violated this Act or the applicable Secretary where a failure of the Secretary to perform any act or duty that is not discretionary is alleged.\n\nDeems as misbranded a food product that contains genetically-engineered salmon unless the food is so labeled."
