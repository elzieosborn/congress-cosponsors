Requires such states and organizations to establish goals on a statewide basis and to consider specified transportation and land use planning strategies, including increasing public transportation systems and supporting land use regulation that coordinates transportation and land use planning and uses existing infrastructure.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to award competitive grants to metropolitan planning organizations to develop or implement emission reduction plans."
