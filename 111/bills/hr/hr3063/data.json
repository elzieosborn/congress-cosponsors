Requires payment of the compensation, if no survivors exist, to a claimant's surviving family members.\n\nRequires a survivor eligible for contractor employee compensation under this Act as well as survivor compensation under the regular compensation schedule for survivors to elect one or the other. Prohibits any payment to a survivor of both kinds of compensation."
