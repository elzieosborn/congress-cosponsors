  <summary date="2010-07-08T14:04:39Z" status="Passed House amended">Secure Federal File Sharing Act - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to: (1) prohibit the download, installation, or use by government employees and contractors of open-network peer-to-peer file sharing software on all federal computers, computer systems, and networks, unless approved in accordance with procedures under this Act; and (2) address the download, installation, or use by government employees and contractors of such software on home or personal computers as it relates to telework and remotely accessing federal computers, computer systems, and networks.

Requires the Director to develop a procedure for receiving requests from heads or chief information officers of agencies for approval for use by government employees and contractors of specific open-network peer-to-peer file sharing software programs that are: (1) necessary for day-to-day business operations, for use in the course of a law enforcement investigation, or to perform official agency business; or (2) instrumental in completing a particular task or project that directly supports the agency's overall mission.

Requires the Director to direct agencies to: (1) establish or update personal use policies to be consistent with the guidance issued under this Act; (2) require contracts to require contractor compliance with that guidance; (3) update their information technology security or ethics training policies to ensure that all employees are aware of the requirements of that guidance and the consequences of engaging in prohibited conduct; and (4) ensure that proper security controls are in place to prevent, detect, and remove file sharing software that is prohibited.

Requires the Director to report annually to specified congressional committees, including: (1) a justification for each open-network peer-to-peer file sharing software program that is approved under this Act; and (2) an inventory of the agencies where such programs are being used.

Requires the budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, to be determined by reference to the latest statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.</summary>
