Entitles each Senator to 1/100th of the Senate earmark allocation and each Member of the House to 1/441 of the House earmark allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMakes it out of order in either chamber to consider any measure that would cause the level of total new budget authority or total outlays for appropriation earmarks, as adjusted, set forth in the applicable budget resolution to exceed or breach such limitations.\n\nRequires a Member or Senator requesting an appropriation earmark, within five legislative days after making such request, to: (1) submit the amount requested, the project name, and a project description of its subject matter to the appropriate Clerk for posting on the Clerk's website; and (2) insert in the Congressional Record a written statement that includes such information and certifies that neither the Member, Senator, or any family member has any financial interest in the earmark.\n\nRequires each Clerk's website to include an up-to-date, comprehensive, and searchable database comprising all such requests for the current fiscal year and the budget year.\n\nMakes a conforming amendment to Rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) of the Rules of the House"
