  <summary date="2010-09-02T20:43:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Heat is Power Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow through 2016: (1) an energy tax credit for investment in wasted heat to electricity property; and (2) a tax credit for the production of electricity from renewable resources for wasted heat. Defines "wasted heat to electricity property" as property comprising a system which generates electricity through the recovery of a qualified wasted heat resource (e.g., exhaust heat or flared gas from any industrial process or waste gas or industrial tail gas, but not a heat resource from a process whose primary purpose is the generation of electricity using a fossil fuel).</summary>
