Requires the pilot program to be carried out at: (1) at least three and not more than five VA medical centers over a five-year period; and (2) centers that provide a training area for educating veterans with mental health conditions in the art and science of assistance dog training and handling. Directs the Secretary, in hiring instructors under the program, to give a preference to veterans who have successfully graduated from PTSD or other residential treatment programs and received certification in assistance dog training.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report annually to Congress during the duration of the program."
