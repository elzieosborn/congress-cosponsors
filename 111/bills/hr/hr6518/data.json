    "text": "Research of Alcohol Detection Systems for Stopping Alcohol-related Fatalities Everywhere Act of 2010 or ROADS SAFE Act of 2010 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), to carry out a collaborative research effort to continue to explore the feasibility and the potential benefits of, and the public policy challenges associated with, more widespread deployment of in-vehicle technology to prevent alcohol-impaired driving.\n\nDirects the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to prescribe certain performance standards to reduce commercial motor vehicle rollover and loss of control crashes and associated deaths and injuries for air-braked truck tractors and motorcoaches with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report to Congress regarding the quality of data collected through the National Automotive Sampling System, including the Special Crash Investigations, as well as recommendation for improvements to the data collection program.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish and publicize a hotline for mechanics, passenger motor vehicle dealership personnel, and passenger motor vehicle manufacturer personnel to contact NHTSA confidentially regarding potential passenger motor vehicle safety defects.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish within NHTSA an honors program for the recruitment of engineering, computer science, and other students interested in training with engineers and other safety officials for a career in vehicle safety.\n\nRevises requirements for rules on early warning reporting by motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment manufacturers about vehicle or equipment defects. Requires early warning reports to include information on consumer complaints, warranty claims, field reports, or technical service bulletins.\n\nRequires all early warning report information to be made available to the public, unless exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Presumes that information shall not be exempt from disclosure, and thus must be made public, if it is: (1) vehicle safety defect information related to incidents involving death or injury; (2) aggregated numbers of property damage claims; or (3) aggregated numbers of consumer complaints related to potential vehicle defects."
