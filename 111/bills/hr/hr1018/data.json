Prohibits containing such horses and burros in corrals or short-term holding facilities for more than six months while awaiting disposition. Prohibits the destruction of such horses or burros unless the Secretaries: (1) determine that the horses or burros are terminally ill or fatally injured; and (2) ensure that the terminally ill or fatally injured horse or burro will be destroyed in the most humane manner.\n\nRemoves the limitation on the number of titles to horse and burros that may be transferred to qualified individuals.\n\nRequires the Secretaries to: (1) provide a public notice 30 days prior to the planned removal of such horses and burros in specified circumstances; (2) track in a centralized database system the number of horses and burros injured or killed during a gathering or holding; (3) determine what information on such horses and burros could be provided to the public; and (4) ensure that such information is easily accessible on BLM's website.\n\n(Sec. 6) Requires owners of private land to return such horses or burros that have wandered onto their land to public lands.\n\n(Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretaries to enter into cooperative agreements with private entities for the management of such horses and burros.\n\n(Sec. 8) Expands the membership of the advisory board on the management and protection of such horses and burros.\n\n(Sec. 9) Applies criminal penalties to any person who transports a live or deceased horse or burro for processing into commercial products.\n\n(Sec. 10) Lifts a restriction on the authority of the Secretary to relocate such horses and burros to public lands where they did not exist at the passage of such Act.\n\n(Sec. 11) Sets forth new reporting requirements on the management of such horses and burros."
