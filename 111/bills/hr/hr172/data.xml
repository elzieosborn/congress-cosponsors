Requires any rates charged for water for municipal, domestic, or industrial use or for the use of facilities for the storage or delivery of water to be adjusted to reflect the estimated revenue derived from contracts for the use of Fryingpan-Arkansas project excess capacity or exchange contracts using project facilities.
