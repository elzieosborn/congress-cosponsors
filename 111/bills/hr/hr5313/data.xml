  <summary date="2010-05-24T21:08:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Offshore Safety and Response Improvement Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study acoustic control systems for offshore oil rigs and to promulgate regulations that: (1) identify approved acoustic control systems for such rigs; and (2) require certain lessees using an offshore oil rig to install such systems within two years after publication of the regulations. Directs the Secretary, in lieu of such actions, to submit to Congress, and make available to the public, a report describing in detail the reasons acoustic control systems are not necessary for offshore oil rigs.

Directs the President, acting through the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to revise the National Contingency Plan developed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include specific response procedures for various predetermined scenarios and conditions relating to oil discharges, including the location and amount of a discharge, and the length of time that has elapsed since a discharge occurred.

Directs the EPA Administrator and the Secretary jointly to review and report to Congress on oil spill removal technologies, including: (1) those used in federal responses; (2) those that are available worldwide and in development; and (3) investments by the EPA and the Department of the Interior in the development of improved oil spill removal technologies and methods.</summary>
