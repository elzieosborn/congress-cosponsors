  <summary date="2010-11-05T17:49:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Safe Prescription Drug Disposal and Education Act - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to permit, for purposes of carrying out the grant program established by this Act for drug disposal units: (1) an ultimate user (or an authorized agent of the ultimate user) who has lawfully obtained a controlled substance to deliver such substance, without being registered, to another person for disposal; and (2) such person to receive such substance for disposal, without being registered.

Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to an eligible entity (i.e., a state, local government, local educational agency, Indian tribe, a federal, state, or local governmental agency, corporation, community coalition, or any combination of such entities) to: (1) establish and operate prescription drug disposal units for disposal of unneeded or expired prescription drugs; and (2) design and implement educational programs on the abuse of prescription drugs and on household items that may be used to cause perception, emotion, or behavior similar to that caused by the use of psychotropic drugs.

Directs the Director of National Drug Control Policy to carry out a public education and outreach campaign to increase awareness of how ultimate users may lawfully and safely dispose of prescription drugs, including controlled substances, through drug take-back programs.</summary>
