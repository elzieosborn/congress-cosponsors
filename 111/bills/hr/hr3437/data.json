Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to cover as a major disaster any \"catastrophic incident\" as defined by the Homeland Security Act, namely any natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage or disruption severely affecting the population (including mass evacuations), infrastructure, environment, economy, national morale, or government functions in an area.\n\nAmends the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop, as an annex to the National Disaster Housing Strategy, lifecycle plans and tracking procedures for housing units provided to individuals and households affected by an emergency or major disaster that establishes policies for procurement, delivery, installation, maintenance, deactivation, and disposal of the units.\n\nRequires the plan to: (1) emphasize the acquisition of housing units that can be recycled and reused for multiple emergencies or major disasters; and (2) include a process for the Administrator to track each housing unit from its date of acquisition through its date of disposal.\n\nAmends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the President to alter any housing unit unsuitable for habitation, before its disposal through sale to a recycler or other purchaser, in a manner that will prevent the unit from being used for habitation."
