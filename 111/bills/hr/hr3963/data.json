The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) \n\nCriminal Investigative Training Restoration Act - Directs the Federal Air Marshal Service to require federal air marshals hired after the enactment of this Act to complete the criminal investigative training program at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center as part of their basic training.\n\nExcuses existing federal air marshals who have previously completed such program from repeating it. Requires any air marshal hired before the enactment of this Act who has not completed the program, however, to complete an alternative training program, as determined by the Federal Law Enforcement Center, that provides the training necessary to bridge the gap between the mixed basic police training, the federal air marshal programs already completed by the federal air marshal, and the training provided through the criminal investigative training program. Deems any such alternative program to have met the standards of the criminal investigative training program.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2010 and FY2011."
