Exempts from this requirement fixed or floating platforms, floating storage units (FSUs), and floating production, storage, or offloading units (FPSOs).\n\nAuthorizes such vessels of countries that are not a party to the Convention to comply with the Act's requirement through other appropriate documentation considered acceptable by the Secretary.\n\n (Sec. 202) Requires covered vessels of at least 24 meters in length, but less than 400 gross tons, engaged on an international voyage (with the same exceptions as for vessels of at least 400 tons), to carry a signed declaration that the vessel's antifouling system complies with the Convention.\n\n(Sec. 204) Sets forth a process for considering additional controls on antifouling systems.\n\n(Sec. 205) Authorizes the Secretary, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to each undertake scientific and technical research and monitoring and promote the availability of information regarding: (1) scientific and technical activities undertaken in accordance with the Convention; (2) marine scientific and technological programs and their objectives; and (3) the effects observed from any monitoring and assessment programs relating to antifouling systems.\n\n(Sec. 206) Directs the EPA Administrator to provide to any party to the Convention that requests information on which decisions to regulate are based or other information used to evaluate the antifouling system.\n\nTitle III: Prohibitions and Enforcement Authority - (Sec. 301) Makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) violate a requirement of this Act; (2) sell or distribute domestically or internationally organotin (biocide) or an antifouling system containing organotin; (3) manufacture or use organotin to formulate an antifouling system; (4) apply an antifouling system that contains organotin on a vessel; or (5) apply an antifouling system on a vessel in violation of the Convention.\n\nProhibits the hull of a vessel, with specified exceptions, from bearing an antifouling system that contains organotin, unless it bears an overcoating that forms a barrier to organotin leaching from the underlying antifouling system.\n\n(Sec. 302) Authorizes the Secretary to investigate and enforce vessel compliance with the requirements of this Act or the Convention.\n\n(Sec. 303) Authorizes inspections by officers or employees of the EPA or of any state designated by the EPA Administrator.\n\nTitle IV: Action on Violation, Penalties, and Referrals - (Sec. 401) Subjects a person who knowingly violates this Act or the Convention to specified criminal and civil penalties.\n\n(Sec. 408) Repeals the Organotin Antifouling Paint Control Act of 1988."
