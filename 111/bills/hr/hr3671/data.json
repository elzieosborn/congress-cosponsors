(Sec. 106) Directs the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a water resources assessment of the Basin. Title II: Computer Modeling and Research - (Sec. 201) Requires the Director of the USGS, as part of the Initiative, to establish a computer modeling program to identify significant sources of nutrient and sediment in the Basin. (Sec. 202) Requires the Director to establish an Internet-based system to provide information regarding: (1) programs designed to reduce sediment and nutrient loss in the Basin; (2) nutrient and sediment levels in the Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries; and (3) successful sediment and nutrient reduction projects.
