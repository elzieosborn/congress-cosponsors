    "text": "No Sanctuary for Illegals Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) increase border patrol recruitment incentives by offering a ($40,000 maximum) repayment of higher education loans; and (2) develop border patrol retention incentives through the establishment of a retention program.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to deploy newly developed technologies to secure U.S. international land and maritime borders.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) prioritize border fence construction; and (2) report to Congress regarding such construction's progress.\n\nRequires that if an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States is arrested for any offense by a state or local law enforcement agency the head of such agency shall immediately notify United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of the arrest and the alien's identity.\n\nRequires that such an arrested alien be detained by ICE and presented before an immigration judge for expedited U.S. removal without release from detention and without further hearing or review. Provides for criminal penalties and expedited removal for such a removed alien who subsequently returns unlawfully to the United States.\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to make inadmissible an alien who has been unlawfully present in the United States for any period of time and who enters or seeks to enter the United States unlawfully. (Current law requires the period of unlawful presence to be more than one year.)\n\n Amends INA to consider a person born in the United States \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States for citizenship at birth purposes if the person is born in the United States of parents, one of whom is: (1) a U.S. citizen or national; (2) a lawful permanent resident alien whose residence is in the United States; or (3) an alien performing active service in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nProhibits a federal government officer or employee from providing federal funds to any state or political subdivision that is determined to be interfering with efforts to enforce federal immigration laws. Terminates such prohibition when the state or political subdivision enters into an agreement with the Secretary to cease such interference."
