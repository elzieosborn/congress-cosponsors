  <summary date="2009-09-10T14:07:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Land-In-Trust Schools and Local Governments Equitable Compensation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to pay each local educational agency and local government annually such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the agency and local government receive full payment for the amount of property tax revenues lost as a result of lands in their jurisdiction being held in trust by the United States for the benefit of a federally recognized Indian tribe or an individual Indian.

Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer the necessary amounts directly to the Secretary of Interior from the Treasury's general fund without further appropriation.

Allows such an agency or local government, notwithstanding those requirements, to enter into a written agreement with the Secretary of the Interior, the appropriate state, and, if appropriate, any federally recognized Indian tribe or individual Indian under which all parties agree that the amounts shall be: (1) waived in whole or in part; (2) limited for an agreed upon number of years; or (3) otherwise adjusted, including the timing of any payment or payments.</summary>
