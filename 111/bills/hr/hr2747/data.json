    "text": "Rural Technology Development and Outreach Act - Amends provisions of the Small Business Act relating to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make grants to organizations to: (1) conduct outreach efforts to increase participation in such programs; and (2) provide application, entrepreneurial, and business skills support to prospective program participants. Requires organizations receiving such funds to direct activities toward small businesses: (1) located in areas that are underrepresented in SBIR and STTR programs; or (2) owned and controlled by women, service-disabled veterans, and minorities. Directs the Administrator to establish an advisory board to carry out authorized activities. Provides a two-year period for each grant award.\n\nRequires federal agencies, in making SBIR and STTR grant awards, to prioritize applications so as to increase the number of recipients from rural areas.\n\nDirects each federal agency conducting an SBIR program to: (1) receive consent to identify the small business applicant to appropriate local and state economic development organizations; and (2) encourage partnerships between SBIR awardees and prime contractors, venture capital investment companies, business incubators, and larger businesses for the purpose of facilitating the progress of SBIR awardees to the third phase of the program."
