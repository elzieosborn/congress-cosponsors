Provides that such percentage shall be 30% in the first fiscal year after enactment, 50% in the second fiscal year, and 80% in the third fiscal year.\n\nDefines \"green technologies\" to mean renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services that: (1) reduce dependence on unreliable sources of energy by encouraging the use of sustainable biomass, wind, small-scale hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services; and (2) use hybrid fossil-renewable energy systems.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit treating any facility originally placed in service after December 31, 2013, as a qualified facility for purposes of the renewable energy production and investment tax credits unless such facility is 100% manufactured in the United States from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100% grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Provides that such percentage shall be 30% for a facility placed in service during 2011, 50% for a facility placed in service during 2012, and 80% for a facility placed in service during 2013."
