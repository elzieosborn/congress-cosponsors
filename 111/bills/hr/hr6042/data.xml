Prohibits any deduction from&#160;the burial allowance&#160;because of a veteran's assets or because of any contribution toward&#160;the burial and funeral&#160;expenses,&#160;unless the expenses incurred are covered by the United States, a state, an agency or political subdivision of the United States or a state, or the veteran's employer.</summary>
