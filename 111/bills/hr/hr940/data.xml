Provides for the sale of specified federal land in Winn Parish, Louisiana, with a right of first refusal to Collins Camp Properties for the Collins Campsites and a specified parcel.

Requires such land sales to be for cash consideration equal to the market value of the land, to be determined by an appraisal approved by the Secretary of Agriculture. Permits the market value to be determined by competitive sale if sold by means other than that provided for above.

Requires the Secretary, in any disposal of lands authorized by this Act, to meet disclosure requirements for hazardous substances, but shall not otherwise be required to remediate or abate those substances.

Requires sale proceeds to be used for the acquisition of lands and interests in the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana.

Requires Collins Camp Properties to pay at closing the costs of appraisal and any administrative and environmental analyses required by law or regulation.

Requires an offer by Collins Camp Properties to be accompanied by statements from holders of Forest Service special use authorizations who agree to relinquish their authorizations upon a sale to Collins Camp Properties.</summary>
