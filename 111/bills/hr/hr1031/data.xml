Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on: (1) including coverage for telehealth services as part of Medicare home health services; and (2) expanding the list of telehealth payment-eligible originating sites to include publicly funded mental health facilities.

Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth, to report to Congress on the use of store and forward technologies in the provision of telehealth services.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to deem that any health care provider participating in certain government health programs meets any requirement for the maintenance of data in paper form if the required data is maintained in an electronic form.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to Congress on state, regional, and community health information exchanges; and (2) establish a project to demonstrate the impact of health information technology on disease management under state Medicaid plans.</summary>
