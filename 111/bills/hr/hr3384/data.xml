  <summary date="2009-09-02T15:44:34Z" status="Introduced in House">S.O.S. (Save Our Schools) Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to eliminate the requirement that states conduct the yearly student academic assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and science that are used in determining whether states, local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools are making adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state academic performance standards.

Eliminates related requirements, such as those subjecting LEAs and schools to certain improvements, corrective actions, or restructuring, if they fail to make AYP toward state academic performance standards for two consecutive years or more.</summary>
