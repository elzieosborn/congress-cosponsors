  <summary date="2009-06-08T14:20:04Z" status="Introduced in House">School Meal Enhancement Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement a school-wide paperless free school meal program which allows local educational agencies (LEAs) to select certain schools to provide free meals to all their students without the use of paper applications to determine their eligibility for free or reduced price breakfasts or lunches under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 or the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.

Prohibits the participation of schools that do not have a student enrollment of which at least: (1) 65% are estimated to be eligible for free meals under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; or (2) 75% are estimated to be eligible for free or reduced price meals under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.

Requires the Secretary to issue guidance that establishes an alternate, paperless method of determining such estimated eligibility rates.

Reimburses the school food service authority of each participating LEA pursuant to a formula that factors in such estimated eligibility rates.</summary>
