  <summary date="2010-04-08T21:35:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of Labor to award capitalization grants to eligible applicants (nonprofit local workforce investment boards, states, political subdivisions of a state, and Indian tribes, or a single national organization) for projects to create jobs and the delivery of self-sustainable social services (i.e., education, training, and career services) to people with barriers to employment.

Authorizes the Secretary to evaluate the effectiveness of capitalization in providing workforce development opportunities and training to people with barriers to employment after the grantee has had three years to capitalize and build or expand its programs.</summary>
