Requires the President to report to Congress on any hearings held, any written comments received, and the impact of such designation on communities within the boundaries of the monument, the nation's energy security, and interests, rights, and uses associated with the land within the monument.\n\nMakes a proclamation ineffective two years following its issuance, unless it is approved by an Act of Congress.\n\nBars the issuance of a proclamation which is substantially similar to a previously issued proclamation that Congress has not approved."
