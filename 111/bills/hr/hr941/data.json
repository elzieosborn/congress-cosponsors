    "text": "Low-Income Rate Payer Disaster Recovery Act of 2009 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President to make contributions to the owner or operator of a private or investor-owned electric utility company serving low-income households for facilities damaged or destroyed by a major disaster only if the costs of repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing such facilities exceed 10% of the facilities' total transmission and distribution rate base minus: (1) accumulated depreciation on the date of the disaster in the case of a single major disaster; or (2) accumulated depreciation on the date of the first major disaster in the case of an aggregation of major disasters during the preceding 12 months.\n\nSets forth application deadlines.\n\nProhibits the total amount of contributions made to an owner or operator from exceeding $50 million in any 12-month period. Authorizes the President, for any major disaster occurring after enactment of this Act, to waive the limit upon determining that the event is of an extraordinary nature. Requires the President to approve or disapprove applications within 30 days after receipt.\n\nAllows an owner or operator who determines that the public welfare would not best be served by repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing a facility to elect to receive, in lieu of the cost-based contribution, 75% of the funding that would have been available."
