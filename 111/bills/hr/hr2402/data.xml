Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) develop a minimum benefit standard for the provision of comprehensive maternity coverage under an individual health plan, which shall require coverage for the full scope of maternity services from preconception through postpartum; and (2) require health insurance issuers to provide data to the Secretary to monitor compliance.

Directs the Comptroller General to report to the appropriate congressional committees on health insurance coverage offered on the individual insurance market and on problems remaining for women after the enactment of this Act.</summary>
