Specifies that the areas of special flood hazard may be either coastal or riverine.\n\nRevises the requirement that a community will be considered to be in the process of restoration if its flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a federal agency in consultation with the local project sponsor. Replaces a federal agency as the deeming authority with the entity or entities that own, operate, maintain, or repair the system.\n\n(Sec. 5) Instructs the FEMA Administrator to implement this Act in a manner that will not materially weaken the financial position of the National Flood Insurance Program, or increase the risk of financial liability to federal taxpayers."
