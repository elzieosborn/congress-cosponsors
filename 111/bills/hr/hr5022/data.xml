  <summary date="2010-04-19T14:48:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Fitness for Life Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make competitive, renewable four-year grants to ten institutions of higher education (IHEs) for the expansion of their master's degree in physical education programs.

Requires IHEs to use the grant funds to: (1) teach students to incorporate technology and innovative teaching practices into physical education instruction and encourage children to be more physically active outside the classroom; (2) develop program curricula that link practice and theory; (3) partner with local educational agencies (LEAs) that serve schools where their students are to serve as full-time student teachers and most of their instruction is to occur; (4) extend their programs into the communities served by their partner LEAs; (5) actively promote their programs to prospective students; and (6) engage in such other activities the Secretary requires.

Directs the Secretary, in developing the grant program, to consult with an IHE that for the past five years has: (1) offered a master's degree in physical education program that emphasizes the incorporation of technology into physical education instruction; and (2) partnered with an LEA that serves schools in which its master's degree candidates serve as student teachers.</summary>
