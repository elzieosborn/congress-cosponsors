  <summary date="2009-11-24T22:21:27Z" status="Introduced in House">American Democracy Index Act of 2009 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to: (1) develop an American Democracy Index (ADI) to evaluate elections for federal office; (2) establish and operate a system to collect and measure election data for use in preparing the ADI; and (3) make the ADI with respect to each federal election available to the public, including through the Internet.

Describes the ADI as an index designed to assist states in the administration of federal elections by presenting collected information on a state-by-state basis in a manner designed to demonstrate administration practices that: (1) ensure the right of individuals to vote; (2) improve the quality of voter access to polls and the quality of voter services; and (3) secure the accuracy and integrity of elections.

Establishes an independent Board of Advisors the EAC shall consult in developing and refining the ADI and the data to be collected.

Directs the EAC to: (1) conduct a pilot program for the 2010 federal elections under which it shall make one or more grants for election data collection in up to five states; and (2) based on such pilot program make one or more grants to collect 2012 federal election data in all states and prepare and publish the first ADI.</summary>
