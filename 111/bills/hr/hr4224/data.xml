  <summary date="2010-05-27T16:23:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Together We Care Act of 2009 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a pilot program to make grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities for the training of public housing residents as home health aides and providers of home-based health services to enable them to provide covered home-based health services (i.e., services for which medical assistance is available under a state Medicaid plan or for which financial assistance is available under this Act) to residents of: (1) public housing who are elderly or disabled, or both; and (2) federally-assisted rental housing who are elderly or disabled, or both, subject to criteria that the Secretary may establish.

Authorizes the use of grant funds: (1) to establish or maintain and carry out a program to train public housing residents to provide covered home-based health care services to elderly and disabled public housing residents and to elderly and disabled residents of federally-assisted rental housing; (2) for the transportation and child care expenses of public housing residents in training; and (3) for the administrative expenses of carrying out such a program.

Provides that for any resident of public housing who is trained as a home health aide or as a provider of home-based health services under the program, any income received for providing covered home-based health services shall apply towards eligibility for benefits under federal housing programs as specified, based on length of time following completion of the training.</summary>
