  <summary date="2010-07-28T20:16:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Personalize Your Care Act of 2010 - Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid), as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to cover a Voluntary Advance Care Planning Consultation.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to eligible entities to: (1) establish statewide programs for physician orders for life-sustaining treatment; or (2) expand or enhance existing programs for physician orders for life-sustaining treatment.

Directs the Secretary to adopt, by rule, standards for a qualified electronic health record, with respect to patient communications with a health care provider about values and goals of care, to adequately display the patient's current: (1) advance directive; and/or (2) physician order for life-sustaining treatment.

Requires under Medicare and Medicaid that an advance directive validly executed outside the state in which the directive is presented must be given effect by a service provider or an organization to the same extent as an advance directive validly executed under the law of the state in which it is presented. Requires that, in the absence of a validly executed advance directive, any authentic expression of a person's wishes with respect to health care be honored.</summary>
