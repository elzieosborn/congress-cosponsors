    "text": "Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 - (Sec. 5) Exempts food and facilities regulated by the Secretary of Agriculture under specified acts from the requirements of this Act.\n\n(Sec. 6) Exempts specified alcohol-related facilities from the requirements of this Act.\n\nTitle I: Food Safety - Subtitle A: Prevention - (Sec. 101) Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to deem a food to be misbranded if it was manufactured, processed, packed, or held in a facility that is not registered.\n\nDeclares that a facility under the FFDCA does not include private residences of individuals.\n\nRequires annual registration of food facilities, including food facilities that export food.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to suspend the registration of any food facility for a violation of the FFDCA that could result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Sets forth procedures for such a registration suspension.\n\nDirects the Secretary to collect an annual fee for registration of a food facility to defray the costs of food safety activities. Terminates the authority to collect such fees after FY2014.\n\n(Sec. 102) Deems a food to be adulterated if it has been manufactured, processed, packed, transported, or held under conditions that do not meet the requirements for hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls.\n\nRequires the owner, operator, or agent of a food facility to: (1) conduct a hazard analysis; (2) identify and implement effective preventive controls; (3) monitor preventive controls; (4) institute corrective actions as necessary; (5) conduct verification activities; and (6) maintain records of monitoring, corrective action, and verification.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to: (1) identify hazards that are reasonably likely to occur in the absence of preventive controls; and (2) establish preventive controls for specific product types to prevent unintentional contamination throughout the supply chain.\n\nRequires the owner, operator, or agent of a food facility to implement a food safety plan before introducing any shipment of food into interstate commerce.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish science-based standards for conducting a hazard analysis, documenting hazards, identifying and implementing preventive controls, and documenting the implementation of the preventive controls.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to require the submission of finished product test results documenting the presence of contaminants in food posing a risk of severe adverse health consequences or death for certain high-risk food facilities after completion of pilot projects and a feasibility study.\n\nRequires the owner, operator, or agent of a food facility to implement a food defense plan that includes: (1) an identification of conditions and practices that may permit a hazard to be intentionally introduced; and (2) a description of preventive measures implemented.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to establish by regulation or guidance preventive measures for specific product types to prevent intentional contamination throughout the supply chain. Requires the owner, operator, or agent of a facility to implement any preventive measures identified by the Secretary.\n\n(Sec. 103) Deems a food to be adulterated if it has been manufactured, processed, packed, transported, or held under conditions that do not meet performance standards.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) issue science-based performance standards applicable to foods or food classes to minimize to an acceptable level, prevent, or eliminate the occurrence of the most significant foodborne contaminants and the most significant resulting hazards; and (2) publish a list of foodborne contaminants that have the greatest adverse impact on public health.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to make recommendations to industry for conducting product sampling.\n\n(Sec. 104) Deems a food to be adulterated if it has been grown, harvested, processed, packed, sorted, transported, or held under conditions that do not meet safety standards for raw agricultural commodities.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish scientific and risk-based food safety standards for the growing, harvesting, packing, sorting, transporting, and holding of raw agricultural commodities: (1) that are a fruit, vegetable, nut, or fungus; and (2) for which the Secretary has determined that such standards are reasonably necessary to minimize the risk of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Requires the Secretary to provide for effective implementation of education and compliance activities.\n\nRequires the Secretary to update existing guidance related to minimizing microbial food safety hazards for fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n(Sec. 105) Requires food facilities to be inspected at a frequency determined pursuant to a risk-based schedule.\n\n(Sec. 106) Directs each person who manufactures, processes, packs, transports, distributes, receives, or holds an article of food in the United States or for import into the United States to permit an officer or employee of the Secretary to have access to and copy all records bearing on whether the food may be adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of the FFDCA. Limits access to such records on farms.\n\n(Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary to establish a tracing system for food that is located in the United States or is for import into the United States that enables the Secretary to quickly identify each person who grows, produces, manufactures, processes, packs, transports, holds, or sells such food.\n\nExempts certain food from tracing requirements, including food produced on a farm or produced through the use of a fishing vessel. Limits the tracing requirements for any grain or similarly handled commodity. Authorizes the Secretary to exempt a food or a type of facility, farm, or restaurant from tracing requirements.\n\nProhibits the violation of any requirement of the food tracing system under this section. Requires the refusal of admission of articles that have not complied with the requirements of the food tracing system.\n\n(Sec. 108) Requires the Secretary to assess fees on each food facility in a fiscal year that: (1) commits a violation of the FFDCA relating to food and so requires additional inspections by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); or (2) has been subject to a food recall.\n\n(Sec. 109) Deems a food to be misbranded if it is part of a shipment offered for import into the United States and such shipment is in violation of provisions requiring a certification of compliance.
