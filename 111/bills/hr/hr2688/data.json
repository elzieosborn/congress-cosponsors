    "text": "Empowered at Home Act of 2009 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise the income eligibility level for home and community-based (HCBS) services for elderly and disabled individuals.\n\nRevises the income eligibility limit for the state option to provide HCBS services under a waiver. Replaces the income limit of 150% of the poverty line with a limit of 300% of the supplemental security income (SSI) benefit rate.\n\nAuthorizes a state to offer HCBS services under a waiver to eligible individuals that differ in type, amount, duration, or scope from the HCBS waiver services offered to other such individuals so long as they are within the scope of services for which the Secretary has authority to approve a waiver and do not include room or board.\n\nIncreases the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for the provision of HCBS services under Medicaid through the state plan amendment option.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report annually to Congress on state use of Medicaid state plan amendment option for HCBS services for elderly and disabled individuals.\n\nDirects the Secretary to award assistance grants to states electing to provide HCBS waiver services under Medicaid through the state plan amendment option.\n\nReauthorizes Medicaid investment grants (currently called transformation grants) at increased funding and specifies additional permissible uses to facilitate the provision of HCBS and other long-term care (LTC) services.\n\nDirects the Secretary to award grants on a competitive basis to eligible states to conduct an evidence- and community-based health promotion program.\n\nAmends SSA title XIX, with respect to treatment of the income and resources of HCBS waiver services recipients who would otherwise be institutionalized, to repeal the state option for (thus requiring) application to such individuals of spousal impoverishment protection requirements.\n\nRequires states to exclude up to six months of the average cost of nursing facility services from an individual's assets or resources for purposes of eligibility for HCBS waiver services.\n\nDirects the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to revise certain data reporting forms and systems to ensure uniform and consistent state reporting under this Act.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on: (1) the provision of home health services under different state Medicaid plans; and (2) the extent to which states offer consumer self-direction of such services, or allow for other consumer-oriented policies with respect to them."
