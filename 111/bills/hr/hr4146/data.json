Allows plans with 100 or fewer participants and beneficiaries to issue an annual pension benefit statement instead of quarterly statements.\n\nRequires the Secretary to make available to: (1) employers educational and compliance materials concerning compliance with requirements for disclosure of investment options to plan participants or beneficiaries; and (2) participants and beneficiaries educational materials to assist them in understanding such disclosures.\n\nPrescribes civil penalties for plan administrators or other persons who fail or refuse to provide required pension benefit statements to plan participants or beneficiaries."
