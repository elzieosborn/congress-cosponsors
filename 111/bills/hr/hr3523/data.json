    "text": "Biofuel Engineering Training Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to award a grant to an appropriate standard-setting or other entity to: (1) develop appropriate standards for the accreditation of undergraduate and graduate biofuel engineering programs at institutions of higher education (IHEs); and (2) study the needs of the biofuel industry for engineering support.\n\nRequires the Secretary to award competitive grants to IHEs to establish Centers of Excellence for Biofuels Research and Training that: (1) integrate biofuels research, training, and instruction; (2) coordinate the broad range of disciplines relevant to biofuels engineering; and (3) work with companies that are commercializing biofuels technology, and local communities spurring economic development and job creation in the biofuels sector.\n\nDirects the Secretary to award portable graduate fellowships to students pursuing doctorates in biofuels engineering. Requires the fellowships, which are for up to three years of study, to provide recipients with an annual living stipend, and cover graduate tuition and incidental expenses.\n\nRequires federal agencies, including national laboratories, to make research facilities available to accredited biofuel engineering programs."
