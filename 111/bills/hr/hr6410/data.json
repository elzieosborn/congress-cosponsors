Requires such systems to meet minimum standards that ensure equipment, technology, procedures, or personnel used to screen cargo provide a level of security commensurate with the security level for the screening of passenger checked baggage.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) establish a system for the regular inspection of shipping facilities for shipments of cargo transported in air transportation, including intrastate air transportation, to ensure that appropriate security controls, systems, and protocols are observed; and (2) enter into arrangements with civil aviation authorities of foreign countries to ensure that such inspections regularly occur at shipping facilities for cargo transported by air to the United States.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to increase the number of air cargo inspectors to carry out such screenings and inspections.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a training and evaluation program for persons who handle air cargo to ensure that such cargo is properly handled and safeguarded from security breaches."
