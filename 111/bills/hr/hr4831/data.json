(Thus caps total earmarks at 1% of total new budget authority and total outlays allocated each fiscal year to such committees.)\n\nMakes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, or amendment if its enactment would cause the applicable allocation of new budget authority or outlays for a fiscal year to be exceeded."
