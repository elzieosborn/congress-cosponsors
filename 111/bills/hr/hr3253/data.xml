  <summary date="2009-07-28T19:38:44Z" status="Introduced in House">Advance Directive Promotion Act of 2009 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require a service provider, Medicare+Choice organization, or prepaid or eligible organization to include the content of an advanced directive in a prominent part of an individual's current medical record.

Requires a service provider to give effect to a valid advance directive executed outside the state in which such directive is presented to the same extent as such provider would give effect to a valid advance directive executed under the law of the state in which it is presented.

Requires an initial preventative physical examination to include an end-of-life planning consultation.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, to operate a clearinghouse and a 24-hour toll free telephone hotline in order to provide consumer information about advance directives, end-of-life decisionmaking, and available end-of-life and hospice care services.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary, directly or through grants to public or nonprofit private entities, to conduct a national public education campaign to increase awareness of advance directive planning.</summary>
