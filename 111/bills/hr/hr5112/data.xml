Federal Buildings Personnel Training Act of 2010 - Directs the Administrator of General Services (GSA) to: (1) identify, annually, the core competencies necessary for federal personnel performing building operations and maintenance, energy management, safety, and design functions to comply with requirements under federal law, including competencies relating to sustainability, water efficiency, electrical safety, and building performance measures; and (2) identify a course, certification, degree, license, or registration to demonstrate, and for ongoing training in, each core competency for the appropriate category of personnel. Requires individuals in each category to demonstrate each core competency identified for the category within one year.

Directs the Administrator: (1) to develop or identify comprehensive continuing education courses to ensure the operation of federal buildings in accordance with industry best practices and standards; and (2) and the Secretary of Energy to develop, annually, a recommended curriculum relating to facility management and the operation of high-performance buildings.

Makes training requirements under this Act applicable to non-federal personnel performing building operations and maintenance, energy management, safety, and design functions under contract with a federal agency. Requires a contractor to provide training to, and certify the demonstration of core competencies for, non-federal personnel in a manner that is approved by the Administrator.</summary>
