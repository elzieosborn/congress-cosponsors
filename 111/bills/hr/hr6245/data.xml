  <summary date="2010-11-05T21:59:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Effective Law Enforcement Through Transparent Interrogations Act of 2010 - Amends the federal criminal code to render inadmissible as evidence in the prosecution of a federal felony all prior and subsequent statements by an individual during a custodial interrogation that are not electronically recorded, except where the recording of such statements is impracticable due to an imminent threat of bodily injury or other exigent circumstances.

 Requires the Attorney General to: (1) make a copy of the electronic recording of a custodial interrogation available to the individual who was subject to such interrogation; (2) identify and catalogue any such recording; and (3) preserve such recording until all related proceedings are final or the applicable statute of limitations has expired.</summary>
