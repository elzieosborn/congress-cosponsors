    "text": "Smart Electronics Act - Requires the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to submit a report to Congress that: (1) assesses the potential for cost-effective integration of smart electronics technologies and capabilities in all products that are reviewed by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the EPA for potential designation as Energy Star products; (2) assesses the growth of consumer electronics utilization and the associated energy consumption; (3) analyzes the potential energy savings and electricity cost savings that could accrue through specific Energy Star program focus on smart electronics; and (4) analyzes and ranks the potential of cost-effective smart electronics technologies. \n\nDefines \"smart electronics\" to mean consumer electronics with one or more of the following: (1) power-factor correction; (2) stand-by power; (3) communication with smart grid and in-home and networked energy monitoring equipment; (4) on-demand and variable processing speed semiconductors; (5) off-peak operation and charging; (6) low power switchable modes; or (7) the ability to achieve greater efficiency with multiple functions on semiconductors.\n\nRequires the Secretary and the Administrator, to the extent that it is consistent with report findings, to: (1) develop a smart electronics emphasis as part of the implementation of the Energy Star program; and (2) establish a Smart Electronics Registry that provides a voluntary mechanism for electronics manufacturers and sellers to register their smart electronics products. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator, in operating the Registry, to work with: (1) manufacturers to develop testing and verification protocols to ensure that products qualify as smart electronics; and (2) sellers to develop qualification criteria for smart electronics sales location labeling."
