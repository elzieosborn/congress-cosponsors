    "text": "Cleanup of Inactive and Abandoned Mines Act - Sets forth provisions to encourage the partial or complete remediation of inactive and abandoned mine sites for the public good by good samaritans (defined as persons who had no role in the creation of the historic mine residue or the resulting environmental pollution and who are not legally responsible for such remediation).\n\nAuthorizes a permitting authority (i.e., the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] or a state or Indian tribe with an approved Good Samaritan program) to issue a permit to a good samaritan for a mine remediation project if it is determined that: (1) the project will improve the environment on or in the area of the mine site to a significant degree; (2) the project will meet applicable water quality standards; (3) the permittee has the financial and other resources to complete, and will complete, the permitted work; and (4) the relevant governmental entities concur with the issuance of the permit. Terminates the authority to issue permits under this Act on September 30, 2019.\n\nExempts permits from requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 relating to environmental assessments and impact statements.\n\nRequires a permitting authority to: (1) consult with permit applicants; (2) maintain all records relating to the permit and the permit process; (3) allow cooperating agencies and the public to participate in the permit process; and (4) monitor remediation projects.\n\nEstablishes civil penalties for violations of permit requirements and authorizes injunctions to require compliance with a permit."
