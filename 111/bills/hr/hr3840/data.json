Requires the President to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees for five years regarding such diplomatic activities.\n\nAmends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that information regarding certain defense items exported without a license under the Arms Control and Export Act be included in the annual military assistance report.\n\nAmends the Arms Export Control Act to direct the President to report to Congress, by country and by international organization, regarding the total dollar value of major defense equipment and defense articles exported pursuant to licenses for the previous fiscal year.\n\nAuthorizes the President to remove satellites and related components from the United States Munitions List, except for any satellite or related component that may be transferred to, or launched into outer space by, the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\nDirects the Inspector General of the Department of State to: (1) review Department investigations of possible misuse of U.S.-origin defense items; and (2) and report to Congress.\n\nDirects the Secretary of State to report to Congress regarding placing the export licensing functions of the Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls on a self-financing basis."
