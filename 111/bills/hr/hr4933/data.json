Directs the President to transmit to Congress and make publicly available a five-year strategy for implementing the Initiative.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) address the urgent shortage of U.S. health professionals without exacerbating the health professional shortage in developing countries; and (2) pursue trade and investment policies that support United States Global Health Strategy goals.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct: (1) the U.S. Executive Director at each international financial institution to oppose any loan, grant, or policy that would result in the imposition of user fees or service charges on poor individuals in connection with such institution's financing programs for primary education or primary health care; and (2) the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to oppose any loan or program that would not exempt government spending on health care, health infrastructure, and education from national budget caps and restraints, hiring and wage ceilings, and other IMF-imposed limits."
