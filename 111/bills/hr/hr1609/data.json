(Current law authorizes payment denial for up to five crop years.)\n\nRequires that a person or legal entity that received benefits while ineligible due to excess income repay such amounts fully.\n\nDirects the Secretary to request the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to verify the income-related eligibility of a benefit applicant, and deny benefits to a person or entity determined to be ineligible. Authorizes Farm Service Agency reconsideration of a denial."
