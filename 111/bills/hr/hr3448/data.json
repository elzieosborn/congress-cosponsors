Instructs the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Nuclear Energy Council.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for the Nuclear Power 2010 program.\n\nDirects DOE and the NRC to reevaluate the Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant schedule for purposes of significant acceleration.\n\nProhibits use of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to arbitrarily prevent uranium mining on federal lands.\n\nProhibits the federal government from collecting additional leasing fees, beyond those currently applicable to mine uranium on federal lands.\n\nRequires that any remediation fees collected in association with commercial uranium mining on federal lands be applied only to remediation of sites that incurred damage as a result of commercial nuclear activities. Prohibits the application of such fees to remediation of sites that incurred damage as a result of government or government-sponsored activities."
