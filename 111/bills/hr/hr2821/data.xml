  <summary date="2009-07-22T18:58:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of the Army to modify the terms of lease agreements entered into with owners and operators of marinas at Lake Cumberland, Kentucky, who have been adversely affected by low lake levels resulting from a Corps of Engineers rehabilitation project at Wolf Creek Dam and to suspend lease payments until the ordinary high water mark at the lake has been restored.

Requires the Secretary to reimburse: (1) counties in Kentucky for income lost as a result of the suspension of the lease payments; and (2) marinas for expenses determined to have resulted from that project.</summary>
