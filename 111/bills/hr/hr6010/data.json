Requires the President to submit to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate: (1) a report on the identity of each U.S. citizen that is on the list of the Joint Special Operations Command or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a high value individual or a high value target; and (2) a written assurance that no U.S. citizens are being added to such list. Defines \"extrajudicial killing\" to mean a premeditated and intentional use of lethal force against a U.S. citizen, but excludes from such definition the use of force in certain circumstances, including against a U.S. citizen whose guilt has been adjudicated consistent with due process of law, who directly participates in armed hostilities against the United States, and against whom force is required for purposes of self defense, defense of others, or for enabling the release of hostages."
