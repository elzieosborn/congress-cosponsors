Extends the authority of the Secretary to make transfers to the Trust Fund for certain annual distributions (duty refunds) to U.S. manufacturers who certify by affidavit to have used such imported cotton in the manufacture of cotton shirts.

Requires annual affidavits from shirting manufacturers and from yarn spinners.</summary>
