Increases such prison term to any term of years or life if death results from such torture. Defines \"torture\" to mean intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, on a person for such purposes as obtaining from that person or another person information or a confession, punishing that person, or intimidating or coercing that person or another person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, but does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful sanctions."
