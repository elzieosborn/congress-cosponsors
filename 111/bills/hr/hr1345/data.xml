  <summary date="2010-12-27T20:15:35Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">District of Columbia Hatch Act Reform Act of 2010 - Amends federal law commonly referred to as the "Hatch Act" (concerning political activities of federal, state, and local employees) to: (1) include the District of Columbia or an agency or department thereof within the definition of a "state or local agency" under such Act; (2) ensure that individuals employed by an educational or research institution, establishment, agency, or system supported in whole or in part by the District are exempt from Hatch Act restrictions; (3) exempt the duly elected head of an executive department of the District who is not classified under the District's merit or civil-service system from the prohibition against being a candidate for elective office; and (4) direct the Merit Systems Protection Board to issue an order to withhold federal funds upon finding that a District employee ordered removed for violating the Hatch Act has been reappointed in the District within 18 months.

Excludes District of Columbia employees and officials from the definition of "employee" for purposes of provisions applicable to the political activities of only federal employees.

Makes such amendments effective on the date a law is enacted by the District that places restrictions on political activities of employees of the District of Columbia government.</summary>
