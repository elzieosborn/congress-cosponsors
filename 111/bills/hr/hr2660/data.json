Requires such capital standards to conform, to the extent practicable, with the capital standards prescribed under the Act.\n\nAuthorizes an appropriate federal banking agency, by regulation, to establish any additional relevant capital measures for such entities or vehicles necessary to guard against the risk that they become undercapitalized.\n\nRequires the appropriate federal banking agencies to define jointly a \"special purpose entity,\" with a focus on trusts and other legal entities established by or for an insured depository institution to fulfill narrow, specific, or temporary objectives, including: (1) the holding of financial assets transferred during a securitization process; (2) issuing applicable securities representing claims on such assets; (3) receiving and reinvesting cash flows from such assets; and (4) distributing proceeds to holders of the securities."
