Authorizes the Secretary to deposit not more than $50 million into a tribal school modernization escrow account and to accept additional amounts from other federal agencies and nonfederal public or private sources. Declares that no bond shall be an obligation of, nor shall payment of the principal be guaranteed by, the United States, the tribes, or their schools. Exempts from federal income tax any earnings through the investment of funds under the control of a trustee. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit to individuals who hold such bonds."
