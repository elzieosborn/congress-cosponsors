Provides that the decision to participate or to implement any assistance or recommendations provided by the Secretary shall be at the sole discretion of the owner or operator.\n\n Requires the Secretary, upon request, to advise such owner or operator of the overall effect that implementing all categories of assistance or recommendations provided by the Secretary would have on the Secretary's determination regarding: (1) the placement of the facility in a risk-based tier under CFATS, or (2) whether the facility would no longer present a high level of security risk. Provides that no act or failure to act by the owner or operator relating to assistance or a recommendation provided by the Secretary shall be interpreted or applied to create any liability or cause of action for compensation that may result from a terrorist act or incident at the facility, with an exception for intervening acts or omissions.\n\nDirects the Secretary to develop a repository for information and data on best practices and cost-effective technologies for implementing CFATS and the voluntary technical assistance program. Provides for the protection of information that may reveal: (1) vulnerabilities or other details of the security capabilities of a covered facility that may be exploited by terrorists, and (2) trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is not customarily in the public domain.\n\nDirects the Secretary, by October 4, 2013, in coordination with a nine-member Chemical Facility Security Advisory Board established by this Act, to submit a report regarding lessons learned from the voluntary technical assistance program."
