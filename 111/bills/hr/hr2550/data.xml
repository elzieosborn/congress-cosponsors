Defines "municipal financial adviser" as a person who, for compensation, engages in the business of: (1) providing advice to a municipal securities issuer with respect to issuance of securities, investment of proceeds from such securities, the hedging of risks associated with such securities, or preparation of disclosure documents; (2) assisting a municipal securities issuer in selecting or negotiating guaranteed investment contracts or other investment products; or (3) assisting a municipal securities issuer in the primary offering of securities not involving a public offering.

Provides requirements concerning sanctions (including revocation of registration), fair practices, compliance with standards of operational capability, and the fiduciary duty of such an adviser.</summary>
