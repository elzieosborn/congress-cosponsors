Declares that the sunset provision (general terminating date of December 10, 2010) of EGTRRA shall not apply to title V of such Act ( Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Provisions).\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) provide for an increase to $3.5 million of the estate tax exclusion (eliminating the phase-in period); (2) impose a maximum estate tax rate of 45% ; (3) restore the phaseout of graduated estate tax rates and the unified credit against the estate tax; (4) set forth estate valuation rules for certain transfers of nonbusiness assets; and (5) limit estate tax discounts for certain individuals with minority interests in a business acquired from a decedent."
