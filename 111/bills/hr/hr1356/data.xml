Sets forth a schedule for repayment of principal only if the borrower defaults.



Shields a servicer from liability for entering into a loan modification or workout plan with respect to any such mortgage if the servicer acts consistent with the fiduciary duty of servicers of pooled residential mortgages under the Truth in Lending Act.</summary>
