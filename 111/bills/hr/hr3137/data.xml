Allows the United States Postal Service (USPS) to accept monetary donations for the funding of plaques in connection with the commemorative designation of postal facilities.

Requires the USPS to provide for a plaque after a law has been enacted for such designation and sufficient amounts have been received.

Allows, with the donor's consent, use of amounts received in excess of those needed for funding a plaque for any other such designated facility.

Prohibits construing this Act to: (1) affect the authority of the USPS regarding requirements concerning the design, placement, and limitation on costs relating to commemorative plaques, so long as the requirements are applied uniformly; or (2) limit, supersede, or render inapplicable any other authority or duty of the USPS regarding the commemorative designation of a facility or the funding, commissioning, or installation of a plaque in connection with such a designation.</summary>
