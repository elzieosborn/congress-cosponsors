  <summary date="2010-06-03T16:02:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Manufactured Housing Licensing Clarification Act of 2010 - Amends the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to exclude from the definition of "loan originator" (and exempt from the requirements of the Act) an individual who performs manufactured or modular housing retail sales activities and is licensed or registered under state law, unless such individual is compensated by a lender, a mortgage broker, or other loan originator or by one of their agents.

 Adds to state loan originator licensing law requirements new ones declaring that the state loan originator supervisory authority: (1) has created education and testing appropriate for personal property loan originators; and (2) ensures that additional mortgage lending licensing is not required of a state-licensed personal property lender and has not created unnecessary, duplicative licensing requirements for state-licensed lenders engaged solely in making residential mortgage loans secured by personal property, such as manufactured homes.</summary>
