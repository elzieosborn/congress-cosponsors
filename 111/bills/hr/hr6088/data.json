Allows a state law, between such dates, also to: (1) reduce from 6.5% to 6% the unemployment rate triggering an \"on\" indicator for any week; and (2) treat as repealed for the extended unemployment compensation period the requirement regarding the average rate of total unemployment in the state (seasonally adjusted)."
