  <summary date="2010-10-07T18:06:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Endocrine Disruptor Screening Enhancement Act of 2010 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in carrying out the Estrogenic Substances Screening Program: (1) not later than one year after this Act's enactment, to publish a list of at least 100 substances for testing of endocrine disrupting substances that may be in drinking water and a plan for the identification of additional substances for testing with the goal of testing all substances that have been placed on the Drinking Water Preliminary Contaminant Candidate List; (2) to give priority in selecting substances for listing to substances that pose the greatest public health concern; (3) not later than two years after enactment of this Act, to publish guidance on developing and updating protocols for testing of possible endocrine disruptors; (4) within four years after this Act's enactment, to issue test orders for all substances on the list; (5) not later than 180 days after this Act's enactment, to publish an electronic, publicly searchable database that contains information regarding the testing program; and (6) within six months after receipt of testing results, to determine whether to take administrative action related to the substance.

Authorizes the Administrator to accelerate testing for a substance if: (1) such substance is known to be found in sources of drinking water; (2) a substantial population is known to be exposed to the substance; and (3) the substance is either suspected to be an endocrine disruptor or has a structural similarity to a substance known to be an endocrine disruptor. Requires the Administrator, not later than one year after this Act's enactment, to publish guidance on how the Administrator will make determinations on whether to require accelerated testing for such substances.

Authorizes any person to petition the Administrator to add a substance to the list or the plan and to issue an order requiring the substance to be tested on an accelerated basis.</summary>
