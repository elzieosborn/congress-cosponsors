        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to extend the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to audit reports prepared by a domestic registered or foreign public accounting firm regarding issuers, brokers and dealers, and any companies subject to securities laws (currently only issuers and public companies).</p> <p>Directs the Board to: (1) establish standards for independence to be used by a registered public accounting firm; and (2) conduct annual inspections to assess compliance of each registered public accounting firm that regularly provides audit reports for more than 100 brokers and dealers.</p> <p>Declares it shall be unlawful for any person that is suspended or barred from being associated with a registered public accounting firm to willfully become, or remain associated with any broker or dealer (as well as, under current law, any issuer) in an accountancy or financial management capacity. </p> <p>Prescribes a formula for mandatory allocation among non-issuer brokers and dealers of accounting support fees due from them to fund the budget of the Board.</p> <p>Authorizes the Board to: (1) refer an investigation to a self-regulatory organization if the investigation concerns an audit report for a broker or dealer subject to the organization's jurisdiction; and (2) make available to the organization documents or information related to such an investigation or an inspection.</p>]]></text>
