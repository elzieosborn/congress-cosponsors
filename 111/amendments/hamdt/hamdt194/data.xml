  <description>Amendment clarifies that passage of laws in Afghanistan that restrict or repress human rights, including the rights of women, undermines the support and goodwill shown by the international community and the U.S. through the considerable financial aid that has been provided to help rebuild Afghanistan and may make it harder to generate public support for those seeking to provide such support in the future.</description>
