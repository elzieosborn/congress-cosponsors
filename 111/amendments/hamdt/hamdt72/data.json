  "purpose": "An amendment in the nature of a substitute numbered 1 printed in House Report 111-73 to provide $991 billion for non-military di scretionary spending in FY10, $469 billion above President Obama's request; provides $479 billion as sufficient defense spending level; and reduces the deficit by 58% by FY2012. Savings come from eliminating Cold War era weapons systems, targeting waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon, military redeployment and military contractors out of Iraq, repeal of Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year, crackdown on corporate welfare and reinstating a quarter-cent tax (0.25%) on all stock transactions. Spending increases include health care for all Americans, cutting poverty in half in ten years, additional economic stimulus, increased Foreign Assistance, combating global warming and establishing energy independence, providing comprehensive education, and providing health care to veterans as an entitlement.",
