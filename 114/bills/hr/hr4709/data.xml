This bill amends the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 to require commercial email messages to contain an "unsubscribe from all" option that recipients may select, with not more than one additional action required by the recipient, to send a reply requesting not to receive future emails from the sender.

A commercial email message must remain capable of receiving such unsubscribe replies for at least 30 days after the transmission of the original message.</summary>
