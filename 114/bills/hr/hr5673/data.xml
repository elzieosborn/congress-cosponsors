This bill authorizes the President, upon request of a governor of a state, to declare that a major disaster exists as a result of contamination of drinking water from a public water system. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must promulgate regulations to carry out such authority within 60 days of this bill's enactment.

In the case of such a declared major disaster, the federal coordinating officer appointed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act shall ensure that the coordination of administration of relief required under such Act includes coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, and any other relevant agency.</summary>
