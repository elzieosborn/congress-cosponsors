This bill expresses the sense of Congress on a cost-of-living increase to Social Security benefits for seniors.

The Department of the Treasury shall disburse a one-time payment to certain individuals who are entitled to a benefit under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act (SSAct), an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or a veterans benefit, or are eligible for a cash benefit under SSAct title XVI (Supplemental Security Income).

The amount disbursed shall be 12% of the amount of such benefit payment or SSI cash benefit payable to the individual for November 2015.

The Internal Revenue Code is amended to require a Social Security number to claim the refundable portion of the child tax credit.

As offsets for these payments:

 all balances under the United States Enrichment Corporation Fund are hereby permanently rescinded; of the amounts obligated, but not expended, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 for the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury shall transfer $2.5 million to the general fund of the Treasury; and of the funds made available to the Department of Energy under the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program Account for the cost of direct loans as authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the unobligated balance is hereby rescinded.</summary>
