  <summary date="2015-08-14T18:41:53Z" status="Reported to House amended, Part I">Seniors' Health Care Plan Protection Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) States the intent of Congress to: (1) continue to study and request input on the effects of socioeconomic status and dual-eligible populations on the Medicare Advantage (MA) STARS rating system before reforming it, and, pending study and input results; (2) delay Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authority to terminate MA plan contracts solely on the basis of performance under the STARS rating system.

Amends part C (Medicare+Choice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services, through the end of plan year 2018, from terminating a contract with respect to the offering of an MA plan by a MA organization solely because the plan has failed to achieve a minimum quality rating under the 5-star rating system.</summary>
