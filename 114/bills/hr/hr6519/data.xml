This bill prohibits reducing or withholding federal financial assistance that a state or local government would otherwise receive because such state or local government has in place any policy that limits or restricts compliance with a detainer.

A "detainer" is defined as any order or request by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for a state or local official to:

 temporarily hold a person until such person may be taken into federal custody, transport such a person for transfer to federal custody, or notify DHS prior to releasing such person.</summary>
