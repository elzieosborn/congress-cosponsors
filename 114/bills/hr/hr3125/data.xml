This bill requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to submit a biannual report to Congress on the number of proposed firearm transfers where: (1) a licensed gun dealer submitted a background check through the National Instant Criminal History Background Check System (NICS), (2) NICS failed to respond to the licensed gun dealer within three business days, and (3) the licensed gun dealer completed the transfer.

The FBI must also report on the procedures followed once the transferee is discovered to be ineligible.</summary>
