This bill amends the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 to revise hold harmless requirements for the allotment of career and technical education assistance grants to states.&#160;A state is prohibited from receiving an allotment for a fiscal year that is less than 90% of the allotment the state received for the preceding fiscal year. (Currently, no state may receive an allotment less than the one it received for FY1998.)</summary>
