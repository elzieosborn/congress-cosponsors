The stock must meet specified requirements and be transferred to the employee from an eligible corporation in connection with the performance of services as an employee.\n\nA corporation is eligible if: (1) no stock of the corporation is readily tradable on an established securities market during the year or any preceding year, and (2) it has a written plan under which at least 80% of all employees have the same rights and privileges to receive stock for the year.\n\nEmployees are excluded if they are or have been: (1) a 1% owner, the chief executive officer, or the chief financial officer of the corporation; (2) a family member of the specified individuals; (3) or one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation.\n\nThe corporation transferring stock must notify employees regarding the option of deferring income and meet specified withholding and reporting requirements."
