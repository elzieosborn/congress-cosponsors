  <summary date="2016-05-23T16:24:37Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Crosswalk Hospital Code Development Act of 2015

This bill amends Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid (CMS) to establish a crosswalk between Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes and Medicaid Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) codes for similar hospital services. (A crosswalk shows users where to put data from one scheme into a different scheme.)

Specifically, CMS must develop HCPCS versions for MS-DRGs that is similar to the Internal Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) codes for such MS-DRGs such that, to the extent possible, the MS-DRG assignment shall be similar for a claim coded with the HCPCS version as an identical claim coded with an ICD-10-PCS code.

CMS must develop and publish a freely available HCPCS/MS-DRG definitions manual and software.</summary>
