This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to define "fill material" to mean any pollutant that replaces portions of waters of the United States with dry land or that changes the bottom elevation of a water body for any purpose and to exclude from its meaning pollutants discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste (e.g., mining waste). Thus, permits issued under the Clean Water Act that allow for the discharge of fill material into navigable waters and wetlands may not include those waste pollutants.</summary>
