  <summary date="2016-01-20T16:01:44Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to collect data, and report annually to Congress, regarding instances in which an alien admitted to the United States as a refugee returns temporarily or permanently: (1) to the country of the alien's nationality at the time of such admission; or (2) in the case of an alien having no nationality at the time of such admission, to the country in which the alien last habitually resided prior to such admission.

The bill prohibits DHS from admitting aliens into the United States as refugees until Congress passes a joint resolution giving DHS authority to resume admitting such aliens.</summary>
