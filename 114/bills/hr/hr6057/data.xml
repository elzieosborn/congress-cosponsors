 This bill amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit contributions and expenditures in federal elections by multicandidate political committees or separate segregated funds sponsored by foreign-controlled corporations and associations (at least 50% owned by a non-U.S. citizen or foreign national). Ownership and operating fund reporting requirements are set forth.

 A foreign national Floor Agenda Team may not participate in the decision-making process of any person's election-related activities (such as those of a corporation, labor organization, or political committee).

The bill establishes within the Federal Election Commission (FEC) a clearinghouse of existing public information regarding the political activities of foreign principals and agents of foreign principals.

 The Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 is amended to: (1) revise foreign agents' supplemental reporting requirements, and (2) provide civil penalties for specified reporting violations.</summary>
