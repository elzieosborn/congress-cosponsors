  <summary date="2015-01-28T21:00:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015

 Amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to eligible state and local governments to develop, improve, or expand comprehensive domestic child trafficking deterrence programs that assist law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judicial officials, and qualified victims' services organizations in collaborating to rescue and restore the lives of trafficking victims, while investigating and prosecuting offenses involving child human trafficking. Authorizes such grants to be used for the establishment or enhancement of specialized training programs, dedicated anti-child human trafficking law enforcement units and task forces, problem solving court programs for child human trafficking victims, and victims' services programs.

Amends the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to: (1) include human trafficking and the production of child pornography within the definition of "child abuse" for purposes of such Act; and (2) authorize grants to develop and implement specialized programs to identify and provide direct services to victims of child pornography.

Amends the federal criminal code to allow state and local prosecutors to obtain wiretap warrants in state courts for investigations into human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and child pornography production.

Amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to require the law enforcement agency that enters a missing children report with the National Crime Information Center to: (1) include a photograph of the child taken within the previous 180 days, and (2) notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of each child reported missing from a foster care family home or childcare institution.

Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) apply the prohibition against sex trafficking of minors or of other persons by force, fraud, or coercion to patronizing or soliciting such a person for a commercial sex act, and (2) provide that the government need not prove that the defendant recklessly disregarded the fact that the victim had not yet attained 18 years of age if the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.

Directs the Attorney General to ensure that all task forces and working groups within the Violent Crimes Against Children Program engage in activities to increase the investigative capabilities of law enforcement personnel in the detection, investigation, and prosecution of persons who patronize or solicit children for sex.

Modifies the standard for defense to a prosecution for transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity to require the defendant to show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant reasonably believed that the person with whom he or she engaged in the commercial sex act had attained 18 years of age.

Amends the federal criminal code to include among the rights of crime victims: (1) the right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement, and (2) the right to be informed about all such rights and about victims' services required under the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and to be provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' Rights Ombudsman of the Department of Justice.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States, as a leader in monitoring and combating human trafficking throughout the world, must hold all nations to U.S. standards.</summary>
