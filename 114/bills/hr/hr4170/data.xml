 This bill directs the Department of Labor to:

 draft disclosures which describe the rights and liabilities of customers and providers of domestic care services, require that any provider of domestic care services give such disclosures to each customer before entering into a contract with the customer, and disclose to the customer whether the individual or individuals who will provide such services are employees of the provider of domestic care services or independent contractors. It shall be unlawful, and subject to certain civil penalties, for any provider of domestic care services to contract with a customer without first providing the disclosure document required by this Act.</summary>
