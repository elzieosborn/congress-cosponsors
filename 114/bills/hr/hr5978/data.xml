  <summary date="2017-06-08T16:22:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Amendments Act of 2016

This bill makes several changes to the U.S. Coast Guard major acquisition system.The changes are designed to establish a customer-oriented acquisition system.

The bill expands the acquisition responsibilities of the Coast Guard's Chief Acquisition Officer and Vice Commandant. Additionally, the bill limits the Coast Guard's authority to procure unmanned aerial systems (drones).

The Coast Guard may extend an acquisition contract without competition if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)approves.DHS must study the effects that multi-year contracting has on Coast Guard acquisition programs.

The bill also requires the Coast Guard to make payment based on a predetermined fixed amount to the Department of Defense (DOD) for medical care of current or former members of the Coast Guard and their dependents at DOD facilities.

The bill revises the deadline for when certain fishing vessels must be in compliance with the alternative safety compliance program.

National Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2016

The Coast Guard must also develop a land-based system to backup its Global Positioning System (GPS).
