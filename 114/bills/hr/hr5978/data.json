Additionally, the bill limits the Coast Guard's authority to procure unmanned aerial systems (drones).\n\nThe Coast Guard may extend an acquisition contract without competition if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)approves.DHS must study the effects that multi-year contracting has on Coast Guard acquisition programs.\n\nThe bill also requires the Coast Guard to make payment based on a predetermined fixed amount to the Department of Defense (DOD) for medical care of current or former members of the Coast Guard and their dependents at DOD facilities.\n\nThe bill revises the deadline for when certain fishing vessels must be in compliance with the alternative safety compliance program.\n\nNational Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2016\n\nThe Coast Guard must also develop a land-based system to backup its Global Positioning System (GPS).\n\nThe Coast Guard is authorized to reimburse private entities for costs incurred to construct projects that facilitate safe and efficient marine transportation."
