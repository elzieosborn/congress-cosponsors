        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>Reciprocity Ensures Streamlined Use of Lifesaving Treatments Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish a reciprocal marketing approval process that allows for the sale of a drug, biological product, or medical device that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if the product is approved for sale in another country.</p> <p>For a product to be granted reciprocal marketing approval, the product's sponsor must submit a request to the FDA that demonstrates: (1) the product may be sold in at least one country from a specified list of countries, (2) the FDA and listed countries have not withdrawn approval of the product because of safety or effectiveness concerns, and (3) there is a public health or unmet medical need for the product.</p> <p>The FDA may: (1) require postmarket studies of a product granted reciprocal marketing approval, or (2) decline to approve a product that is not safe and effective.</p> <p>The FDA must grant or decline reciprocal marketing approval not later than 30 days after receiving a request. During that period, the FDA and product sponsor must negotiate and finalize product labeling and, for a medical device, classify the device.</p> <p>Congress may pass a joint resolution to grant reciprocal marketing approval to a product that the FDA declines to approve through this process.</p> <p>User fees apply to requests for reciprocal marketing approval.</p> The FDA must encourage the sponsors of potentially eligible products to request reciprocal marketing approval.]]></text>
