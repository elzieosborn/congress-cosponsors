This bill prohibits a state or local government from receiving federal financial assistance if it restricts or prohibits a government entity or official from: (1) sending to or receiving from the responsible federal immigration agency information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status, or (2) maintaining or exchanging information about an individual's status.

 The prohibition shall be lifted when a state or local government submits a comprehensive plan to no longer restrict or prohibit such actions.</summary>
