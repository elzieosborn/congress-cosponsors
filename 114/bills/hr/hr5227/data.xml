Library of Congress Modernization Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill authorizes the Library of Congress to purchase, maintain, or replace reproducers for books published either in raised characters, on sound-reproduction recordings, or in any other form (currently limited to reproducers of sound-reproduction recordings) for the use of the blind and for other physically disabled U.S. residents.

(Sec. 3) The bill establishes the Library of Congress National Collection Stewardship Fund, whose amounts may be used for:

 preparing collection materials for long-term storage; and transferring amounts to the Architect of the Capitol for designing, constructing, altering, upgrading, and equipping collections preservation and storage facilities for the Library of Congress, or for acquiring real property by lease for the preservation and storage of Library of Congress collections. The Library of Congress shall report a plan for expenditures from the fund in its first five fiscal years of operation.

(Sec. 4) The bill requires continued service on the Joint Committee on the Library in a new Congress, until new committee members are appointed, of Members of Congress who served on such Committee in the previous Congress.

The bill also sets forth requirements for determining who shall serve as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library before its first organizational meeting in a new Congress.</summary>
