 This bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to promulgate a final consumer product safety standard for free-standing clothing storage units (furniture items referred to as, or that may contain, a chest, door chest, chest of drawers, dresser, or bureau) to protect children from tip-over-related death or injury, unless the CPSC determines that a voluntary ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International standard adequately protects children and is likely to be complied with by furniture manufacturers.

If an ASTM standard meets the CPSC's requirements, the standard shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule.</summary>
