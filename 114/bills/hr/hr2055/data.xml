It is the sense of Congress that it shall be the goal of the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Secretaries of the military services, to ensure the management of the manufacturing workload of the military arsenals to maintain critical capabilities and ensure cost efficiency and technical competence in peacetime, while preserving the ability to provide an effective and timely response to mobilizations, national defense contingency situations, and other emergent requirements.

The Secretary shall report to Congress on the equipment, weapons, weapons systems, components, subcomponents, and end-items purchased from foreign entities and identify: (1) those items which could be manufactured in U.S. military arsenals or military depots to meet such goals, as well as (2) a plan for moving that workload into U.S. military arsenals or depots.</summary>
