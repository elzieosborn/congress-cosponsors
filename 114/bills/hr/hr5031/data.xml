This bill authorizes amounts made available to any department or agency for Ebola response and preparedness under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 to be used for Zika virus response and preparedness. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available for Zika virus response and preparedness until such amounts have been fully obligated.

The President shall: (1) require all federal officials and employees responsible for insect-bourne infectious disease response and preparedness, including efforts to eradicate such disease, to cooperate by sharing best practices; and (2) report to Congress at specified intervals on the programs and activities of the federal government for Zika virus response and preparedness.</summary>
