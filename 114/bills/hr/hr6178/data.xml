This bill revises the methodology for apportioning federal highway funds among states. Specifically, the bill adjusts each state's apportionment based&#160;not only on certain tax payments attributable to highway users in&#160;the state, but also on other federal taxes collected&#160;in&#160;the state. The bill also caps the apportionment that each state may receive.</summary>
