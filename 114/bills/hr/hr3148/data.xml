  <summary date="2015-07-27T18:48:48Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill exempts broadcast television stations from the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) amended joint sales agreement (JSA) rules if the stations were parties to a JSA that was in effect on the effective date of the amendment adopted by the FCC on March 31, 2014.

Under the FCC's amended rule, a television station that sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time of another station in the same market is attributed an ownership interest subject to ownership limitations. The bill exempts stations from being considered in violation of such ownership limitations by reason of the amended rule if they were a party to an existing JSA that was in effect on the effective date of the amendment.</summary>
