This bill bars any major rule proposed by a federal agency on or after enactment of this bill from taking effect as a final rule until the Department of Labor, through the Bureau of Labor Statistics, conducts a study to determine how the rule will impact:

 wage growth (including for hourly and part-time workers) in each industry to which it is applicable, and employment in each such industry. The bill states that the requirement for conducting a study under this bill may not be fulfilled by a study that is conducted prior to this bill's enactment date, or conducted by another agency.</summary>
