  <summary date="2017-02-09T18:32:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2016 

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) permit an individual to pay primary care service arrangement costs from a health savings account; and (2) allow an eligible taxpayer enrolled in a high-deductible health plan to take a tax deduction for cash paid into a health savings account, even if the taxpayer is simultaneously enrolled in a primary care service arrangement.

Under a "primary care service arrangement," an individual is provided coverage restricted to primary care services in exchange for a fixed periodic fee or payment for such services.

For the purposes of certain tax-deductible expenses for medical care, the bill expands the definition of "medical care" to include periodic provider fees, including: (1) periodic fees paid to a primary care physician for a defined set of medical services or the right to receive medical services on an as-needed basis; and (2) pre-paid primary care services designed to screen for, diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease and promote wellness.</summary>
