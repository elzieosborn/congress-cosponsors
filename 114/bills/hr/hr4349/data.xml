This bill requires the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to award grants to states for real-time, Internet-based bed registries that provide information about beds in inpatient psychiatric facilities, crisis stabilization units, residential community mental health treatment facilities, and residential substance abuse treatment facilities to facilitate the identification of space for the temporary treatment of an individual in psychiatric or substance abuse crisis.

A bed registry must: (1) describe and provide contact information for every relevant facility in the state; (2) provide real-time information about the number of beds available at each facility and, for each available bed, provide the type of patient that may be admitted, the level of security provided, and any other information that may be necessary to identify an appropriate facility for an individual in crisis; and (3) allow specified users to search the registry for an appropriate and available bed for an individual in crisis.</summary>
