This bill amends the Commodity Exchange Act to make the Federal Housing Finance Agency the appropriate federal banking agency for any Federal Home Loan Bank (thereby exempting any Federal Home Loan Bank loan from regulation as a swap).

The Legal Certainity for Bank Products Act of 2000 is amended to include as a bank any Federal Home Loan Bank.</summary>
