This bill prohibits an air carrier operating an aircraft from charging ticketed passengers a fee for the use of a lavatory on such aircraft. If an aircraft lacks an adequate number of functioning lavatories at the time of boarding, the carrier shall permit a ticketed passenger to select alternative equivalent air transportation operated by such carrier without charging an additional fee.

 A carrier must refund any baggage fee for baggage that does not arrive within two hours after the passenger arrives at the scheduled destination.</summary>
