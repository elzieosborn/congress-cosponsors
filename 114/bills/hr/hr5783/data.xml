  <summary date="2017-02-16T14:39:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2016

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for tax-preferred Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts to pay for trade or business expenses, including the purchase of equipment or facilities, marketing, training, incorporation, and accounting fees. The bill allows annual nondeductible contributions to such accounts of up to $10,000, subject to a $150,000 limit on total contributions to the account and adjustments for inflation after 2017. The bill sets forth rules for the tax treatment of contributions to and rollovers or distributions from the accounts, similar to rules governing individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Qualified distributions from the accounts are excluded from gross income.</summary>
