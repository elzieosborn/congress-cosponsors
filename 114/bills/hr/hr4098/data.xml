This bill amends titles III (Institutional Aid) and V (Developing Institutions) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to permit an eligible minority-serving institution of higher education (IHE) to concurrently receive grant funds under more than one of the following programs: (1) the Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions program; (2) the Strengthening Native American-serving, Nontribal Institutions program; (3) the Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions program; and (4) the Hispanic-Serving Institutions program.

At least 35% of grant funds awarded under each program must be awarded to IHEs that are not eligible to concurrently receive funds under more than one program.

An eligible minority-serving IHE is a Hispanic-serving institution, Alaska Native-serving or Native Hawaiian-serving institution, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institution, or a Native American-serving nontribal institution.</summary>
