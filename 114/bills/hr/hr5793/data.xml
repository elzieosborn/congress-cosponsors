This bill amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to direct the chief election official of a state to distribute mail voter registration application forms to each person who becomes a U.S. citizen at a naturalization ceremony in that state at the ceremony's conclusion.

The Department of Homeland Security shall implement procedures necessary to enable state chief election officers to carry out this requirement.</summary>
