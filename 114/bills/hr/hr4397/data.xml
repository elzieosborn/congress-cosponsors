This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop and preposition caches of emergency response equipment, which may include firefighting equipment and fire suppression agents, to facilitate the rapid deployment of resources needed to reduce damage to life, property, and the environment in the event of an accident involving rail tank cars transporting hazardous material, crude oil, or flammable liquids.

Such caches shall be strategically prepositioned along rail routes over which a high volume of high-hazard trains operate in a manner that lowers the response time of firefighters to fight fires involving flammable liquids and to prevent such fires from spreading. FEMA may collect fees from railroad carriers to develop and preposition the caches.</summary>
