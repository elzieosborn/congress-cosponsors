Provides funding from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for Administrative Expenses and Federal-Aid Highways.

Rescinds specified balances of unused contract authority from the HTF.

(Most of DOT's budget is mandatory budget authority rather than discretionary budget authority. The mandatory budget authority is primarily in the form of contract authority derived from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Contract authority is the authority to obligate funds in advance of an appropriation Act.

Spending from the HTF is determined both by authorization bills and appropriations bills. Authorization bills provide contract authority for highway programs, and appropriations bills include obligation limitations that determine how much of the contract authority may be used in a given year.)

(Sec. 120) Specifies allocations and requirements for distributing obligation authority from the HTF among federal-aid highway programs.

(Sec. 121) Credits funds received by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics from the sale of data products to the Federal-Aid Highways account to reimburse the bureau for expenses.

Provides funding from the HTF to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) for: (1) Motor Carrier Safety Operations and Programs, and (2) Motor Carrier Safety Grants.

 (Sec. 130) Directs the FMCSA to require certain Mexican motor carriers to meet specified safety requirements when applying to operate beyond U.S. municipalities and commercial zones on the U.S.-Mexico border.

(Sec. 131) Requires the FMCSA to provide written notice of violations of certain safety procedures and regulations that could require an expedited safety audit or compliance review or a written response demonstrating corrective action.

 (Sec. 132) Prohibits funds from being used to enforce certain hours-of-service rules for commercial drivers, including the requirements for: (1) two off-duty periods from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m., (2) or the prohibition on using more than one restart during a consecutive 168-hour period. Requires the 34-hour restart rule in effect on December 26, 2011, to be restored.

(Prior to 2013, commercial drivers were required to take at least 34 hours off duty after working for 60 hours in a seven-day period [or 70 hours in an eight-day period], which is known as the "34-hour restart requirement." FMCSA regulations that took effect in 2013 require the 34-hour off-duty period to cover two consecutive 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods, and limit the drivers to one 34-hour "restart" in a 168-hour period.)

(Sec. 133) Prohibits funds for Motor Carrier Safety Operations and Programs from being used for a wireless roadside inspection program until after DOT makes specified certifications to Congress.

(Sec. 134) Specifies that federal laws and regulations related to hours of service for commercial drivers preempt state and local laws and regulations. Makes the preemption retroactive to the date of enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994

(Sec. 135) Prohibits funds from being used to amend, revise or otherwise modify regulations for safety fitness determinations for motor carriers until the DOT Inspector General makes specified certifications.

Provides appropriations to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for Operations and Research.

Provides funding from the HTF to NHTSA for Operations and Research and Highway Traffic Safety Grants.

(Sec. 140) Provides additional funding to NHTSA for travel and related expenses associated with state management reviews and core competency development training for highway safety staff.

(Sec. 141) Exempts from the current fiscal year's obligation limitation for NHTSA programs any obligation authority that was made available in previous public laws.

(Sec. 142) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used to conduct or support the National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers or any similar survey of alcohol and drug use by drivers.

(Sec. 143) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used to mandate global positioning system tracking without fully considering privacy concerns.

Provides appropriations to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) for:

 Safety and Operations, Railroad Research and Development, the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program, Federal-State Partnership for State Of Good Repair Grants, Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Grants, Northeast Corridor Grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), and National Network Grants to Amtrak. (Sec. 150) Limits overtime for Amtrak employees. Permits Amtrak to waive the limit for specific employees due to safety or operational efficiency reasons. Requires Amtrak to report to Congress on waivers granted and overtime payments incurred.

Requires rental payments received pursuant to this provision to be credited to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

(Sec. 171) Prohibits DOT or MARAD from using funds provided by this bill for fee-for-service contracts for vessel disposal, scrapping, or recycling, unless there is no qualified domestic ship recycler that will pay any sum to purchase and scrap or recycle a vessel owned, operated or managed by MARAD or that is part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

Provides appropriations to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) for:
