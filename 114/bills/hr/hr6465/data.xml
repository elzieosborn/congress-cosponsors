  <summary date="2017-05-23T17:39:43Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) by allowing a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program to incorporate a water quality improvement partnership program that encourages investment by publicly owned treatment works and municipal separate storm sewer systems in watershed-based projects for improving water quality. Those partnerships may be used by publicly owned treatment works and municipal separate storm sewer systems to attain and maintain water quality standards.</summary>
