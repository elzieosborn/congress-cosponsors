This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to permit the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide support to partnerships between hospitals and other local health care facilities to improve access to mobile medical health care services for individuals present in the United States who are not citizens or nationals. (Mobile medical health care services are provided in a moveable vehicle or a non-permanent clinic.) In providing such support, HHS must give priority to areas with a high ratio of such individuals to citizens and nationals.</summary>
