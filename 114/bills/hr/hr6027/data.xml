This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to exempt health insurers in jurisdictions where premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions are not available from the annual fee on health insurers. Currently, premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions are not available in U.S. territories. The bill reduces the total amount to be collected annually from health insurers by the amount that would have been collected from those jurisdictions.</summary>
