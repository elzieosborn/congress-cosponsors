  <summary date="2016-11-23T22:24:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Veterans Emergency Treatment Act or the VET Act

This bill declares that, if a veteran who is enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care program requests a medical examination or treatment at an emergency department of a VA medical facility, the veteran shall be provided with:

 a medical screening examination to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists; and if an emergency condition exists, stabilizing medical treatment or transfer to another VA or non-VA medical facility. If a non-stabilized emergency medical condition exists the VA hospital may not transfer the veteran unless the veteran, after being made aware of the risks, makes a written transfer request, or a physician (or a qualified medical person if a physician is not present) certifies that the medical benefits of a transfer outweigh the risks.

The VA may not take adverse action against a VA employee because the employee refuses to authorize the transfer of an enrolled veteran with a non-stabilized emergency medical condition or because the employee reports a violation of a requirement of this Act.

A VA or non-VA medical facility may not delay provision of an appropriate medical screening examination or further medical examination and treatment required in order to inquire about the payment method or insurance status of an enrolled veteran.</summary>
