  <summary date="2015-10-07T18:45:04Z" status="Reported to House with amendment(s)">DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct each component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), on a quarterly basis, to submit to the Chief Human Capital Officer of DHS (the Chief): (1) the number of employees who had been on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for six consecutive months or longer; (2) the total cost to the component associated with such leave and paid non-duty status for the quarter; and (3) the average duration that employees are placed on such administrative leave or paid non-duty status for six months or longer. Requires the Chief to submit quarterly reports for 2016-2018 to Congress on the number of such employees, the costs to DHS, and any actions taken by DHS to resolve any personnel matter involved.

Requires the Chief to: (1) maintain records of the number of employees who are placed on administrative leave or paid non-duty status for personnel matters and the associated costs; and (2) determine appropriate actions to be taken by DHS to resolve any personnel matter objectively, appropriately, and expeditiously or to reduce the use of such leave and paid non-duty status.

Encourages DHS to leverage existing systems and operations to implement this Act's requirements.

(Sec. 3) Directs the Chief to develop and implement a department-wide policy in accordance with existing federal guidance specifically related to the use of such leave or paid non-duty status for personnel matters. Requires such policy to: (1) include the responsibilities of the DHS components for reporting related information to the Chief, and (2) provide guidance on expediting the resolution of a personnel matter involved in an objective and appropriate manner.</summary>
