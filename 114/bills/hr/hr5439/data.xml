This bill amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to replace the Federal Election Commission with the Federal Election Administration (FEA).

The Government Accountability Office shall conduct: (1) a thorough examination of the Attorney General's enforcement of the criminal provisions of FECA and Internal Revenue Code requirements and prohibitions regarding the Presidential Election Campaign Fund and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account; and (2) an ongoing study on the level of funding that constitutes an adequate level of resources for the FEA to execute competently the responsibilities imposed on the FEA by this bill.</summary>
