This bill appropriates funds to carry out the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program for the first full fiscal year after the enactment of this Act and for each of the following four fiscal years. This Program compensates local governments for tax revenue lost due to tax-exempt federal lands within their boundaries.

The bill amends the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 to extend payment and project authorities for the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Program for five years. This Program provides payments to states to compensate for the cost of providing services in tax-exempt federal lands within their jurisdiction.</summary>
