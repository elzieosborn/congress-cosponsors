  <summary date="2015-03-17T21:40:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Establishes an Appeals Task Force to evaluate the backlog of appeals of claims within the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

Requires the Task Force to study: (1) the anticipated surge in appeals of claims; and (2) possible improvements to the appeals process, including whether substantive and structural changes to the overall appeals process are required.

Directs the Task Force to submit to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Chairman of the Board of Veterans' Appeals, and the Court a feasible, timely, and cost effective plan to eliminate the backlog of appeals based on the remedies and solutions it identifies. Requires the Secretary, Chairman, and Court to: (1) fully consider those remedies and solutions, (2) implement those the Secretary deems appropriate, and (3) submit to Congress justification for failing to implement any such remedy or solution.</summary>
