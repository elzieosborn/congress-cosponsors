This bill allows federal agencies, under Office of Personnel Management regulations, to remove certain employees from civil service or to reduce their grade or pay.

An employee may appeal within 7 days to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which must refer the case to an administrative judge to expedite a final decision within 45 days after the MSPB receives the appeal.

If the administrative judge cannot reach a decision within 45 days, the removal or reduction becomes final. But the MSPB must explain to Congress why a decision was not issued.</summary>
