This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to make chiropractic personnel eligible for appointment to the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Surgeon General must ensure that doctors of chiropractic (chiropractors) are trained, equipped, and otherwise prepared to fulfill public health and emergency response service responsibilities in the Commissioned Corps.

The President must appoint at least six chiropractors into the commissioned Regular Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps.

The Surgeon General must submit a quarterly report to the relevant congressional committees on measures taken by the President, Surgeon General, and HHS to carry out this Act.</summary>
