This bill amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to:

 eliminate the dollar amount thresholds for mandatory reporting of the identity of persons making contributions (generally in the aggregate amount or value in excess of $200 within the calendar year or election cycle) to political committees in federal elections; and so require reporting the identification of all persons making contributions within the calendar year or election cycle to such committees, regardless of the amount.</summary>
