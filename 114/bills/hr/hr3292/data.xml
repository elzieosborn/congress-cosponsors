This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to revise Medicare payment for indirect medical education (IME) costs in teaching hospitals. (Teaching hospitals receive IME payments to account for various factors that increase costs in such hospitals.)

Under current law, the IME adjustment is calculated based on the ratio of the hospital's full-time equivalent (FTE) interns and residents to beds. The bill alters the calculation of IME payments such that they are equal to the product of a base amount (adjusted, after FY2019, by the market basket percentage increase applicable to discharges and to account for new teaching programs) and an allotment factor based on FTE resident count.

The bill also makes a technical amendment.</summary>
