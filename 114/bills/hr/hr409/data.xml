  <summary date="2015-02-02T16:09:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Punishing Innocent Americans Act 

 Reinstates the 10-year statute of limitations period applicable to the collection of amounts paid to Social Security beneficiaries by administrative offset. (This former statute of limitations was repealed effective May 22, 2008.)

Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSAct), with respect to overpayments under OASDI or SSAct title XVI (Supplementary Security Income) (SSI), to prevent the recovery of any such overpayments made to or on behalf of individuals under age 18 by shielding such individuals from liability for the repayment of such amounts.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit any tax refund offset of Social Security overpayments made to or on behalf of a minor (under age 18).</summary>
