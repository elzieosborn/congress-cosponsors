  <summary date="2016-05-03T17:19:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Compact Impact Relief Act of 2016

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to make quarterly increases in the federal medical assistance percentage, under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, to cover expenditures for medical assistance provided to qualified nonimmigrants under the Compact of Free Association by American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the State of Hawaii.

The bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to make local educational agencies eligible for impact aid (aid to jurisdictions that lose property tax revenue due to federal activities or location within tax-exempt federal areas) for educating alien children admitted to the United States as citizens of one of the Freely Associated States.

The bill amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 to grant a preference to citizens and nationals of the United States within Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in the receipt of housing assistance over any non-resident alien.

The bill directs the Department of State to contract with an eligible organization to conduct an independent assessment of the strategic importance of the relationship between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.</summary>
