This bill amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act to prohibit a state to which a TANF grant is made from using any part of such grant for drug testing of TANF applicants or recipients.

If the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines that a state has violated such prohibition, it shall reduce the family assistance grant amount payable to the state for the immediately succeeding fiscal year by not more than 1%.

This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to prohibit drug testing of aid recipients under the housing choice voucher program.</summary>
