This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify the federal student loan discharge process for a veteran who has a total and permanent disability.

Specifically, it directs the Department of Education (ED) to establish a system to automatically transmit, from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Department of Defense (DOD), an applicable determination of unemployability or assignment of a service-connected disability rating of 100%.

ED must accept, as sufficient documentation of a borrower's total and permanent disability, a determination of unemployability by the VA or an assignment of a service-connected disability rating of 100% by the VA or DOD that is transmitted in accordance with such system.</summary>
