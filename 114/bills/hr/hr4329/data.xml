This bill amends the Small Business Act to revise requirements for federal procurement contracts awarded to small businesses.

The total value of federal procurement contract awards for a fiscal year may not be determined in a manner that excludes the value of a contract based on:

 where the contract is awarded; where it is performed; whether the contract is required by federal law to be performed by an entity other than a small business; whether funding for the contract is made available in an appropriations Act, if the contract is subject to requirements for civilian procurement planning and solicitation or military procurement as well as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); or whether the contract is otherwise subject to the FAR.</summary>
