This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Environmental Protection Agency to revise the national primary drinking water regulation by lowering the action level for lead in drinking water to no more than: (1) 10 parts per billion by December 31, 2020; and (2) 5 parts per billion by December 31, 2026.

(An action level for lead is a certain contaminant level that triggers a requirement for the public water system to take additional actions to control corrosion from lead. The current action level for lead is 15 parts per billion.)</summary>
