  <summary date="2015-06-03T19:12:29Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Knife Owners' Protection Act of 2015

 Allows any individual who is not otherwise prohibited by federal law from possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a knife to transport a knife from any state or place where such individual may lawfully possess, carry, or transport such a knife to any other state or place where such individual may lawfully do so: (1) by motor vehicle if the knife is not directly accessible from the passenger compartment or is in a closed container, glove compartment, or console; or (2) by other means over land or through water or the air if the knife is in a closed container. Excludes the transport of a knife with the intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year involving the use or threatened use of force against another person or with knowledge, or reasonable cause to believe, that such an offense is to be committed in the course of, or arising from, the journey.

Allows an individual to carry a knife or tool that is designed for enabling escape in an emergency and that incorporates a blunt tipped safety blade or a guarded blade or both for cutting safety belts in the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle without being secured in a closed container, glove compartment, or console, except in the passenger cabin of aircraft whose passengers are subject to airport screening procedures of the Transportation Security Administration.

Establishes a cause of action by individuals subjected to deprivation of rights provided under this Act. Requires the court to award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party if an individual asserts this Act as a claim or defense.</summary>
