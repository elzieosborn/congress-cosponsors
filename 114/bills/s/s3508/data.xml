This bill prohibits the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from considering the social cost of carbon, methane, nitrous oxide, or greenhouse gas as part of any cost benefit analysis, unless a federal law is enacted authorizing such consideration.

The EPA must report on the number of proposed and final rulemakings, guidance documents, and agency actions since January 2009 that use those social costs, including as part of any cost benefit analysis required under Executive Order 12866 or other relevant authority.</summary>
