  <summary date="2016-01-11T17:51:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to waive applicable general and Medicaid requirements of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) in order to conduct demonstration projects through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMS Innovation Center) that involve PACE. Prohibits HHS, however, as part of a CMS Innovation Center demonstration, from waiving: (1) the requirement to offer items and services under Medicare without limitations, and (2) certain requirements regarding enrollment in and disenrollment from PACE programs.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that HHS should use waiver authority to provide, in a budget neutral and expeditious manner, PACE programs with increased operational flexibility to support their ability to improve and innovate and to reduce technical and administrative barriers that have hindered enrollment in them.</summary>
