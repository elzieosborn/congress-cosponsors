This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to set forth requirements about data collection related to students with disabilities. Specifically, the bill requires institutions of higher learning to outline which documents disabled students need to submit in order to ensure they are eligible for student disability support services.

Institutions must submit key data related to their undergraduate students with disabilities for inclusion in federal postsecondary institution data collection efforts.</summary>
