This bill directs the Government Accountability Office to submit a biennial report on the current state of the skills gap in the United States, including: (1) an analysis of the effectiveness of efforts to close such gap, and (2) policy recommendations to improve such efforts.

The bill defines "skills gap" as the difference between the specific skills set of employees and the skills desired by employers.

Each report may include:

 an analysis of employer participation in apprenticeships and on-the-job training in the United States; an assessment of the Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship program to determine if it can be better utilized; an analysis of the prevalence and portability of recognized postsecondary credentials that align with occupations that are in demand; a comparison of policies and strategies addressing the current skills gap in the United States with those employed by other large countries; and an analysis of the specific barriers preventing the U.S. workforce from acquiring the skills desired by U.S. employers, including an assessment of opportunities to reduce those barriers.</summary>
