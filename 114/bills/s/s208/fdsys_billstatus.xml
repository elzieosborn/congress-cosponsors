and (3) within five years, to expand such system to all land, air, and sea ports of entry. </p> <p>Prohibits travel, training, bonuses, or salary increases for DHS political appointees if the metrics requirements, the objectives relating to the achievement of situational awareness and operational control, or the biometric exit data system requirements are not met.</p> <p>Directs DHS to submit a northern border threat analysis.</p> <p>Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in DHS a program known as Operation Stonegarden, under which DHS shall make grants to eligible law enforcement agencies to enhance border security.</p> <p>Authorizes the sale or donation of certain excess personal property of DOD for border security activities.</p> <p>Directs DOD to reimburse states for the cost of the deployment of any National Guard units or personnel to perform operations and missions under State Active Duty status in support of a southern border mission, subject to a specified cap.</p> <p>Directs DHS to hire, train, and assign to duty, by September 30, 2019: (1) 5,000 full-time CBP officers to serve on all inspection lanes and enforcement teams at U.S. land ports of entry on the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico;

and (3) an annual report that details the implementation plan for required staff enhancements. </p> <p>Directs DHS to ensure that each CBP officer is equipped with a secure two-way communication and satellite-enabled device that allows CBP officers to communicate between ports of entry and inspection stations and with law enforcement entities.</p> <p>Requires DHS to establish a program for awarding grants for the purchase of: (1) identification and detection equipment;

and </li> <li>substantially reduce passenger vehicle and pedestrian crossing wait times by upgrading or expanding existing ports of entry. </li></ul> <p>Requires DHS to consult with Interior, USDA, the Secretary of State, the International Boundary and Water Commission, the International Joint Commission, and appropriate representatives of states, Indian tribes, local governments, and property owners to: (1) determine locations for new ports of entry; and (2) minimize adverse impacts from such ports on the environment, historic and cultural resources, commerce, and the quality of life of the communities and residents located near such ports.</p> <p>Permits DHS, upon determining that the acquisition of a leasehold interest in real property and the construction or modification of any facility on the leased property is necessary to facilitate the implementation of this Act, to acquire such interest and construct or modify such facility. </p> <p>Allows CBP and GSA, over a 10-year period, to: (1) enter into cost-sharing or reimbursement agreements or accept donations of real or personal property to facilitate the construction, alteration, operation, or maintenance of a facility or other infrastructure at a port of entry; and (2) transfer property or services between the CBP and GSA for activities related to a port of entry. Directs CBP to: (1) consider the impact of a proposal submitted for such an agreement on reducing wait times at that and other ports of entry, the proposal's potential to increase trade and travel efficiency through added capacity, and the proposal's potential to enhance the security of the port of entry; and (2) report annually on agreements entered into. </p> <p>Directs DHS to: (1) develop a strategic plan for standardized collection of vehicle wait times at land ports of entry; (2) develop a standardized model for the allocation of CBP officers and support staff at land ports of entry that utilizes current and future operational priorities and threats, historical staffing levels and patterns, and anticipated traffic flows; and (3) identify and adopt not less than two new outcome-based performance measures that support the trade facilitation goals of CBP, which measures shall include the extent to which trusted traveler and shipper program participants experience decreased annual percentage wait time, and an annual reduction in percentage of referrals to secondary inspection facilities, compared to nonparticipants. </p> <p>Authorizes CBP, for a 10-year period,&nbsp;to enter into a partnership with a requesting person under which CBP will provide, and the person will pay a fee to reimburse CBP for the cost of providing, services related to customs, agricultural processing, border security, or immigration inspection-related matters at land border ports of entry. </p>]]></text>
