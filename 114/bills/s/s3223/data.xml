This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into cooperative agreements with states to: (1) expand opioid use disorder treatment capacity, (2) make such services more affordable to those who cannot afford them, and (3) help individuals receive treatment and sustain recovery. (Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.)

Funding is allocated to a state based on the severity of the opioid epidemic in the state and the strength of the state's response strategy.

The bill provides funds for these cooperative agreements for FY2017 and FY2018.</summary>
