This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require an alien to list on his or her naturalization application such person's current legal name and date of birth and all other names used since birth.

The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security, by May 31, 2017, to: (1) complete the digitization of fingerprints of aliens who were fugitives, convicted criminals, or subject to deportation orders or who had other derogatory information dating back to 1990 under the Historical Fingerprint Enrollment program; and (2) store such digitized fingerprints along with related biographical data in its Automated Biometric Identification system.</summary>
