  <summary date="2015-10-02T17:33:35Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Phone Scam Prevention Act of 2015

Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to publish on its website a report that identifies existing technologies that consumers can use to protect against misleading or inaccurate caller identification information.

Requires the FCC, within one year after enactment of this Act, to submit to Congress a report detailing a plan to expeditiously develop, within six years after submission of such report, reasonable authentication standards for voice service providers to validate caller information so that subscribers may obtain secure assurances of a call's origin, including the calling party's number and identification.

Extends the prohibition on the provision of inaccurate caller identification information to persons outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States.

Expands the definition of "caller identification information" to include text messages.

Revises caller identification requirements to make standards applicable to voice communications using resources from the North American Numbering Plan (currently, the requirements apply to telecommunications or IP-enabled voice services).</summary>
