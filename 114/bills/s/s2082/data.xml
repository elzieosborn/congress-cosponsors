 authority for transportation of individuals to and from VA facilities for vocational rehabilitation, counseling, treatment, or care; the requirement to provide annual reports to Congress regarding equitable relief in the case of administrative error; authority for Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans; authority to enter into agreement with the National Academy of Sciences regarding associations between diseases and exposure to dioxin and other chemical compounds in herbicides; and authority for performance of medical disabilities examinations by contract physicians.
