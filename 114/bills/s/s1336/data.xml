This bill authorizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to promulgate regulations to implement U.S. participation in the South Pacific Fisheries Convention. The convention is designed to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources and marine ecosystems in the South Pacific Ocean.

The United Statesmust be represented by no more than three commissioners on the Commission of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation.

In addition, a permanent advisory committee is established. Advisory committee members shall represent groups concerned with fishery resources covered by the South Pacific Fisheries Convention.

NOAA must develop a memorandum of understanding with the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council describing the role of the council.

 The State Department has the authority to receive and transmit various communications concerning the South Pacific commission, and can approve or disapprove bylaws and rules adopted by the commission.

This bill details NOAA's authority in implementing this bill and measures adopted by the commission.

(NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard are required to administer and enforce this bill.

This bill lists 16 fishing and shipping activities that are prohibited in the South Pacific Ocean.

 Operators of commercial fishing vessels that do not carry vessel monitoring systems capable of communicating with U.S. enforcement authorities must:

 notify the U.S. Coast Guard prior to or within a reasonable time after entering the exclusive economic zone of the convention area; ensure that all fishing gear is stowed below deck and not readily available for fishing; and if requested, proceed to a specified location so that a vessel inspection can be conducted.</summary>
