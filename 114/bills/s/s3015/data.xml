This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report on the availability of information regarding prescription of opioids after youth sports injury, including information on opioid use and misuse, injury treatments that do not involve opioids, and treatment for opioid addiction. (Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.) The report must determine the extent this information is available to teenagers and adolescents who play youth sports, their families, youth sports groups, and health care providers.

Taking into consideration the findings of the report, HHS must develop and disseminate such information.</summary>
