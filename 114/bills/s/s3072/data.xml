This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide training for administering community awareness briefings and related activities in furtherance of its efforts to counter violent extremism, identify and report suspicious activities, and increase awareness of and more quickly identify terrorism threats, including the travel of individuals from the United States to support a foreign terrorist organization abroad.

DHS shall: (1) assess its efforts to support countering violent extremism at the state, local, tribal, and territorial levels; (2) notify Congress of the number of employees of state, local, tribal, and territorial governments with security clearances sponsored by DHS; and (3) incorporate the public testimonials of former extremists into its efforts to combat terrorist recruitment.

The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in DHS a board to coordinate and integrate DHS's intelligence, activities, and policy related to its counterterrorism mission and functions. The board shall advise DHS on the issuance of terrorism alerts. DHS shall appoint a Coordinator for Counterterrorism to serve as the chair of the board.</summary>
