        <text><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Tax Refund Protection Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to direct the Department of the Treasury to establish a program to license or certify and regulate tax return preparers. The program must: (1) require that the tax return preparer demonstrate good character, good reputation, necessary qualifications to enable the preparer to provide valuable service as a tax return preparer, and competency; (2) require preparers to make certain disclosures relating to fees charged for tax preparation and the average amount of time expected to receive a tax refund; and (3) authorize Treasury to take enforcement action against a tax return preparer for incompetency or wrongdoing. </p> <p>The bill also amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)&nbsp;to regulate refund anticipation payment arrangements. A refund anticipation payment arrangement is defined as an arrangement under which, in exchange for tax preparation services, a taxpayer agrees to pay a fee or interest upon receipt of a tax refund to a preparer or lender either by a direct payment to a preparer or lender or by direct deposit to a designated account. The CFPB shall require tax return preparers to provide a disclosure statement to a consumer about the arrangement and shall promulgate regulations that require preparers to comply with the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act. A certified public accountant who is offering to perform customary and usual accounting activities is&nbsp;exempted from such regulation. </p> <p>Finally, the bill allows an income tax refund requested on a tax return prepared by an income tax preparer to be split between the preparer and the taxpayer and prohibits the treatment of such a split as disreputable conduct merely because the taxpayer requested such split.</p>]]></text>
