    "text": "Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act\n\nThis bill establishes requirements for the Department of Justice (DOJ) with respect to investigating and prosecuting elder abuse crimes and enforcing elder abuse laws. Specifically, DOJ must:\n\n designate Elder Justice Coordinators in federal judicial districts and at DOJ, implement comprehensive training for Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, establish a working group to provide policy advice, and establish best practices for data collection. Additionally, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys must operate a resource group for prosecutors; the Federal Trade Commission must designate an Elder Justice Coordinator within its Bureau of Consumer Protection; and the Department of Health and Human Services must provide data on elder abuse cases referred to adult protective services.\n\nRobert Matava Elder Abuse Prosecution Act of 2016\n\nThis bill amends the federal criminal code to expand prohibited telemarketing fraud to include \"telemarketing or email marketing\" fraud. It expands the definition of telemarketing or email marketing to include measures to induce investment for financial profit, participation in a business opportunity, or commitment to a loan.\n\n A defendant convicted of telemarketing or email marketing fraud that targets or victimizes a person over age 55 is subject to an enhanced criminal penalty and mandatory forfeiture.\n\nThe bill adds health care fraud to the list of fraud offenses subject to enhanced penalties.\n\nDOJ, in coordination with the Elder Justice Coordinating Council, must provide information, training, and technical assistance to help states and local governments investigate, prosecute, prevent, and mitigate the impact of elder abuse, exploitation, and neglect.\n\nIt grants congressional consent to states to enter into cooperative agreements or compacts to promote and to enforce elder abuse laws. The State Justice Institute must submit legislative proposals to Congress to facilitate such agreements and compacts."
