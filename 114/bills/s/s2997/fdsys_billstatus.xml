        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act of 2016</b></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill expresses the sense of Congress that voluntary policies outlined in the Wireless Network Resiliency Cooperative Framework should be adhered to by all parties to aid consumers, 9-1-1 professionals, first responders, and local governments in accessing communication services during emergencies.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must publish a study on the public safety benefits, technical feasibility, and cost of providing the public with access to 9-1-1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable, through:</p> <ul> <li>telecommunications service provider-owned WiFi access points and other communications technologies operating on unlicensed spectrum, without requiring any login credentials; </li> <li>non-telecommunications service provider-owned WiFi access points; and</li> <li>other alternative means. </li> </ul> <p>The types of emergencies subject to this bill are: (1) occasions or instances under the Robert T.
