This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require a state plan for academic content and achievement standards to describe how the state will ensure the educational stability of children in foster care. Specifically, a state plan must include assurances that: (1) a foster child will remain or be enrolled in the child&#8217;s school of origin absent a determination that such enrollment is not in the child&#8217;s best interest; (2) if such a determination is made, the child will be immediately enrolled in a new school, which must immediately contact the child&#8217;s previous school to obtain relevant records; and (3) the state will designate a point of contact for child welfare agencies, who shall also oversee implementation of the state&#8217;s responsibilities under the bill.

Relatedly, a local educational agency (LEA) plan must provide assurances that the LEA will develop and implement procedures governing the provision and funding of transportation services necessary to maintain a foster child&#8217;s enrollment in the child&#8217;s school of origin.

This bill amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to alter the definition of &#8220;homeless children and youths&#8221; to no longer include children who are awaiting foster care placement.</summary>
