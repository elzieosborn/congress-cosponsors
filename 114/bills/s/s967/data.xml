This bill amends the Small Business Act to define "covered loan" as a loan made or debenture issued under the Act or the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 by a private individual or entity.

The bill requires the Small Business Administration to make publicly available on its website a Lender Activity Index (i.e., a user-friendly database of specified information relating to lenders making these loans).

The SBA shall: (1) include in the database information relating to covered loans made during FY2009-FY2015, and (2) incorporate information related to such loans on an ongoing basis.</summary>
