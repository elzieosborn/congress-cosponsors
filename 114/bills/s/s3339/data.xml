 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to roll back the increased threshold for determining the amount of the tax deduction for medical expenses. Currently, individual&#160;taxpayers under age 65&#160;may only deduct those medical expenses that exceed 10% of their adjusted gross income. This bill reduces that percentage to 7.5% for all taxpayers for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015. &#160;

The threshold percentage remains at 10% for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax (AMT).</summary>
