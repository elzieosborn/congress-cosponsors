  <summary date="2016-12-27T16:49:17Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016

This bill prohibits the Forest Service from authorizing a prescribed burn (i.e., a planned fire intentionally ignited) on Forest Service land if, for the county or contiguous county in which such land is located, the national fire danger rating system is indicating an extreme fire danger level.

Nonetheless, the Forest Service may authorize a prescribed burn under such a condition if it coordinates with the applicable state government and local fire officials.</summary>
