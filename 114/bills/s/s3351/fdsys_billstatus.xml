        <text><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Keep Terrorists Off the Battlefield Act</strong></p> <p>This bill prohibits U.S. agency funds from being used to transfer an individual detained at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba: (1) from Department of Defense (DOD) custody or control to the custody or control of another U.S. agency, (2) to the custody or control of any Western Hemisphere country or entity within such country, or (3) to any country or entity that does not have laws prohibiting acts of terrorism or material support for such acts. </p> <p>&quot;Individual detained at Guantanamo Bay&quot; means any individual located at Guantanamo naval station as of October 1, 2009, who is: (1) not a U.S. national or a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, and (2) in DOD custody or control or otherwise under detention at Guantanamo.</p> <p>No U.S. agency funds may be used to fund activities, envoys, or offices to carry out activities to close Guantanamo naval station.</p> <p>The bill expresses the sense of Congress that any individual who was detained at Guantanamo and is suspected of or confirmed by U.S. intelligence as having re-engaged in terrorist activity after being released should be arrested and returned to detention at Guantanamo.</p> </p>]]></text>
