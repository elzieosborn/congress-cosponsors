  <summary date="2016-07-19T14:58:25Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Safeguarding America's Future and Environment Act or the SAFE Act 

This bill requires the President to establish an interagency National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy Joint Implementation Working Group to adopt the National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy (released March 26, 2013) to protect, manage, and conserve fish, wildlife, and plants to maintain the inherent resilience and adaptability of fish, wildlife, and plants to withstand the ongoing and expected effects of extreme weather and climate change.

Each federal agency must integrate the elements of the strategy that relate to conservation, management, and protection of fish, wildlife, and plants into agency plans, environmental reviews, and programs.

The Department of the Interior must establish a National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center to assess and develop scientific information, tools, strategies, and techniques to support the Working Groups and other interested parties in addressing the effects of extreme weather and climate change on fish, wildlife, and plants.

Interior must establish an Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Sciences to advise the working group on the state of the science regarding the effects of extreme weather and climate change on fish, wildlife, and plants and strategies and mechanisms for fish, wildlife, and plants adaptation.

To be eligible to receive funding under the bill, the states (including, the District of Columbia, Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands) must submit to Interior and the Department of Commerce for review and approval a state fish, wildlife, and plant adaptation plan that details efforts to address the effects of climate change on fish, wildlife, and plants and coastal areas.</summary>
