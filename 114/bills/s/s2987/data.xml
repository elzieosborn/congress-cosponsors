This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security to establish a pilot program at three category X airports to reconfigure and install security systems that increase efficiency and reduce vulnerabilities in airport terminals, particularly those that have large open areas where screening occurs.

The TSA shall also establish a pilot program at those airports to develop and test prototypes of screening security systems and security checkpoint configurations to expedite the movement of passengers by deploying an array of technologies including passive and active systems, new types of security baggage and passenger screening systems, and new systems to address passenger and baggage anomalies.</summary>
