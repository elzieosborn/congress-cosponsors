This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise provisions regarding disclosure by researchers of the identifiable, sensitive information of research subjects. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must prohibit researchers from disclosing such information from federally funded research to persons not connected to the research. Researchers may apply to have other research covered by this prohibition.

Disclosures of such information are permitted if required by law, necessary for the medical treatment of the research subject, made with the consent of the subject, or made for the purposes of other research that is in compliance with regulations regarding protection of subjects.

HHS may exempt identifiable information collected for biomedical research from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.</summary>
