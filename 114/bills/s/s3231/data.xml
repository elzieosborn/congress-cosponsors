This bill requires the Department of Labor to establish a program, through grant agreements with state and local government agencies, that provides eligible unemployed or partially employed individuals with opportunities to work in a transitional job for the purpose of enabling them to gain, through wage-paying jobs, the experience and skills needed to move into regular employment.

The Internal Revenue Code is amended to revise the earned income tax credit.

The bill eliminates the existing child care tax credit and establishes in its place a refundable child tax credit equal to a specified percentage of the taxpayer's earned income, with limitations.</summary>
