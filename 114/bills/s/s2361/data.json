    "text": "Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act\n\nThis bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assess the level of risk posed to the domestic air transportation system by individuals with unescorted access to a secure area of an airport.\n\nThe TSA shall:\n\n update DHS rules on access controls, and issue guidance to airport operators for placing expiration dates on each airport credential issued to a non-U.S. citizen. The TSA shall also revise certain regulations to enhance the eligibility requirements and disqualifying criminal offenses for individuals seeking or having unescorted access to an airport's Secure Identification Display Area (SIDA).\n\nBoth the TSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shall implement fully the FBI's Rap Back service for recurrent criminal history vetting of eligible TSA-regulated populations of individuals with unescorted access to any airport SIDA.\n\n The TSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shall ensure that the TSA may receive automated, real-time access to additional Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) data and any other terrorism related category codes to improve the TSA credential vetting program.\n\nDHS shall authorize direct access for each airport operator to the E-Verify program and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) automated system to determine the eligibility of individuals seeking unescorted access to an airport SIDA.\n\nThe TSA shall develop performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of security for airport SIDAs, as well as a model and best practices for unescorted access security meeting specified criteria.\n\nThe TSA shall also:\n\n expand the use of TSA officers and inspectors to conduct physical inspections of airport workers in each airport SIDA and at each SIDA access point, and review airports that have implemented additional airport worker screening or perimeter security. The TSA may conduct a pilot program to test and validate best practices for comprehensive airport worker screening or perimeter security.\n\nThe TSA shall:\n\n increase the use of red-team, covert testing of access controls to any secure airport areas; and review every current security directive addressed to any regulated entity."
