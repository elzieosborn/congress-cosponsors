This bill requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to expedite: (1) the completion of the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Study by taking into consideration information developed by the Gulf Coast Community Protection and Recovery District, and (2) the completion of the reports for the study. (The study will evaluate the feasibility of developing a comprehensive plan for flood risk management, hurricane and storm risk management, and ecosystem restoration for Texas' coastal areas.) The Corps of Engineers may proceed without additional congressional authorization to preconstruction, engineering, and design of coastal protection projects along the Texas coast that are justified by the Corps of Engineers in the reports.</summary>
