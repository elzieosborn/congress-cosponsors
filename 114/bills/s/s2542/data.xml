This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to allow for alternative certification requirements for a residential pediatric recovery center to participate in a state Medicaid program. A "residential pediatric recovery center" is a facility that treats infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is caused by exposure to opioids before birth.

With respect to certifying such facilities, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid must establish guidelines that: (1)&#160;include requirements specifically applicable to treating infants with NAS, and (2) take into account that certain requirements needed for centers that treat adults may not be necessary for facilities that treat such infants. A residential pediatric recovery center&#160;may satisfy the requirements set forth in these guidelines in lieu of any comparable requirements otherwise applicable for purposes of the center's participation&#160;under a state Medicaid program.

A&#160;facility licensed by a state as a residential pediatric recovery center shall be treated as&#160;having satisfied&#160;certification requirements for participation under&#160;the Medicaid program for that state.&#160;</summary>
