  <summary date="2015-02-12T15:23:05Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Prescribe A Book Act

Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award matching grants to nonprofit organizations for the implementation of Pediatric Early Literacy Programs, through which:

 health care providers encourage parents to read aloud to their children and offer parents developmentally appropriate recommendations and strategies for doing so; health care providers give each visiting child between the ages of six months and five years a new, developmentally appropriate children's book to take home and keep; and health care facilities create literacy-rich environments that include gently used books for waiting room use or volunteer readers to show parents the techniques of reading aloud to young children. Requires that the books provided to children under the programs be obtained at a discount.</summary>
