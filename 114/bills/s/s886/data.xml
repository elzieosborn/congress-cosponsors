  <summary date="2016-04-13T18:47:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Smart Energy and Water Efficiency Act of 2015

This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish and carry out a smart energy and water efficiency pilot program to award grants to utilities, municipalities, water districts, and other water authorities for demonstrating novel and innovative technology-based solutions that will:

 increase the energy efficiency of water, wastewater, and water reuse systems; improve those systems to help communities make significant progress in conserving water, saving energy, and reducing costs; and support the implementation of innovative processes and the installation of advanced automated systems that provide real-time data on energy and water. DOE must annually evaluate each grant project and make best practices identified in the evaluations available to the public.</summary>
