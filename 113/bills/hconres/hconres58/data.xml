Recognizes the performance of religious services and the provision of ministry as protected activities under the First Amendment of the Constitution.

Urges the Secretary of Defense, during any lapse in appropriations, to permit: (1) the performance of religious services on property owned or maintained by the Department of Defense (DOD); and (2) military chaplains and other personnel, including contract personnel, hired to perform duties of a military chaplain to perform religious services and ministry.

Expresses the sense of Congress that such services be permitted and available during a lapse in appropriations in the same manner and to the same extent as they are otherwise permitted and available.</summary>
