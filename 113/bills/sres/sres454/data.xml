States that the Senate: (1) recognizes that heart disease remains the number one killer of women in the United States and that basic, preventive heart disease screenings are recommended to be a routine part of women's health care; (2) recognizes the importance of making such screening available for women as recommended; and (3) commits to improving the heart health of all women, tearing down barriers that prevent women from getting screened for heart disease, ensuring women are provided with personalized lifestyle modification recommendations and support, and ensuring every woman has a healthy heart.</summary>
