  <summary date="2013-07-09T17:26:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of State to submit to Congress an Annual Report on International Child Abduction.

Directs the Secretary to ensure that U.S. diplomatic and consular missions: (1) maintain a consistent reporting standard with respect to abduction or access cases, and (2) designate at least one official in each mission to assist U.S. parents who are visiting to resolve such cases.

Directs the Secretary to seek to enter into a memorandum of understanding (an agreement between the United States and a country that is not a Convention country to resolve abduction and rights of access cases) with every country that is not a Convention country. Defines "Convention country" as a country other than the United States that has ratified, acceded, or succeeded to the Hague Abduction Convention and with respect to which the United States has entered into a reciprocal agreement pursuant to the Hague Abduction Convention.

Provides that whenever the President determines that the government of a foreign country has failed to resolve an unresolved abduction or access case, or has engaged in a pattern of noncooperation, the President shall take one or more specified actions to promote resolution or cooperation.</summary>
