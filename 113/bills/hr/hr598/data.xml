  <summary date="2013-02-20T22:40:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Revises mandatory retirement requirements for members of the U.S. Capitol Police under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS).

Requires the Capitol Police Board, at a member's request, to exempt the individual from automatic separation requirements until he or she becomes age 60, if the member: (1) undergoes a physical examination during the six-month period ending on the day the member turns age 57, and (2) on the basis of the examination meets appropriate physical fitness criteria.

(Currently, the Board, when in its judgement the public interest so requires, may exempt such a member from automatic separation until that member becomes 60 years of age.)</summary>
