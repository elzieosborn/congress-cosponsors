  <summary date="2013-03-14T19:31:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require: (1) biennial (currently annual) budget resolutions, (2) biennial appropriations Acts, and (3) biennial government strategic and performance plans.

Defines the budget biennium as the two consecutive fiscal years beginning on October 1 of any odd-numbered year.

Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) determine the impact and feasibility of changing the definition of a fiscal year and the budget process based on that definition to a two-year fiscal period with a biennial budget process based on such period, and (2) report the findings to the House and Senate Budget Committees.</summary>
