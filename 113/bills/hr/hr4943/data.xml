Requires the regional training centers to: (1) develop model interdisciplinary undergraduate curricula on recognizing and responding to cases of child maltreatment that consists of at least a three-course certificate program or minor degree; (2) develop related model graduate curricula for medical schools, law schools, seminaries, and other institutions of higher education that instruct students likely to become child protection professionals or other professionals required by law to report cases of child maltreatment; (3) disseminate such curricula, upon the Attorney General's approval, to institutions of higher education; (4) develop "laboratory" training facilities that allow for simulated, interactive, and intensive training of students preparing for child protection careers as well as child protection professionals currently in the field; (5) assist communities in developing evidence-based prevention programs; and (6) assist states in developing and maintaining forensic interview training programs.</summary>
