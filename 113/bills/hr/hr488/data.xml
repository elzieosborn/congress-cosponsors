  <summary date="2013-02-14T17:04:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, with respect to the allocation of surface mining reclamation funds to states and Indian tribes, to authorize uncertified states and Indian tribes to use certain unexpended and unappropriated balance amounts for: (1) acid mine drainage abatement and treatment, and (2) noncoal abandoned mine land reclamation.

 Modifies limitations placed upon the allocation of such surface mining reclamation funds to provide for payments for filling voids and sealing tunnels and entryways of noncoal mines as well as coal mines.

 ("Uncertified states and Indian tribes" are those which have not certified to the Secretary of the Interior completion of their abandoned coal mine reclamation work.)</summary>
