        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2014 - <b>Title I: Block Grants and Grant Requirements</b> - (Sec. 101) Amends the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to act within 60 days upon a request by an Indian tribe for a waiver of certain local cooperation requirements and an exemption from taxation requirements under the program providing tribes with block grants for affordable and self-determined housing activities. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary to recommend to Congress standards and procedures for: (1) the waiver of the requirement for an Indian tribe to submit Indian housing plans (IHPs); or (2) alternative IHP requirements, which may include multi-year housing plans. Requires recommendations to describe any legislative and regulatory changes necessary to implement them.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary (who currently is merely authorized) to waive environmental review requirements if inadvertent error prevents satisfaction of such requirements and certain other conditions are met. Requires the Secretary to act within 60 days upon a request of an Indian tribe to waive such requirements. </p> <p>Deems an Indian tribe that is receiving a block grant for an affordable housing project, and is using additional funding from other federal sources that does not exceed 49% of the total project cost, to have satisfied any environmental review requirements attached to those sources if the tribe has assumed environmental review, decisionmaking, and action responsibilities under NAHASDA and complied with its environmental review requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) Gives the Secretary 60 days to approve or deny a request to exceed the maximum total development cost for an affordable housing project.</p> <p><b>Title II: Affordable Housing Activities</b> - (Sec. 201) Makes low-income training and employment requirements under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 inapplicable to tribal housing activities under the Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 202) Makes maximum rent and homebuyer payment requirements for housing assisted under NAHASDA inapplicable if the grant recipient has a written policy that includes maximum rent and homebuyer payment requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) Treats rental housing as affordable housing if it is made available only to a current rental family for purchase as a homebuyer or lease-purchase unit and that family was a low-income family at the time of their initial occupancy of the unit.</p> <p>Makes the requirement that housing assisted under NAHASDA remain affordable throughout the remaining life of the property inapplicable to improvements of a privately owned home if the cost of those improvements do not exceed 10% of the maximum total development cost for such home.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) Requires the owner or manager of rental housing assisted under NAHASDA and one or more other federal funding sources to only use leases that require a pre-lease termination notice period.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) Allows recipients of funding under NAHASDA to use funding from the Indian Health Service (IHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the construction of sanitation facilities for housing construction and renovation projects funded under the Act.</p> <p><b>Title III: Allocation of Grant Amounts</b> - (Sec. 301) Reauthorizes appropriations for the block grant program through FY2018.</p> <p>(Sec. 302) Sets forth notice requirements when an Indian tribe has undisbursed block grants under the Act. Directs the Secretary to require a justification from any block grant recipient whose total amount of undisbursed block grants in the HUD line of credit control system is more than three times the formula allocation the recipient would otherwise receive, if that formula amount is $5 million or more.
