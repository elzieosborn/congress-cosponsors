        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Servicemembers Insurance Relief Act of 2014 - Declares that a member of a servicemember's household neither loses nor acquires a residence or domicile for purposes of insuring a motor vehicle primarily for personal, family, or household use if: (1) the servicemember has temporarily moved to comply with any temporary duty or permanent change of station order, or (2) the member of the household has temporarily moved to accompany a servicemember who is complying with such an order.</p> <p>Defines: (1) "servicemember" as a member of the uniformed services, the National Guard, or reserve components; and (2) "member of a household" as the servicemember, the spouse of a servicemember, or any dependent residing with such a servicemember or a servicemember's spouse.</p> <p>Requires insurers to provide a member of a servicemember's household with a servicemembers insurance choice notice if a household member notifies the insurer of such a move. </p> <p>Directs the Federal Insurance Office of the Department of the Treasury to promulgate a standard servicemembers insurance choice notice that: (1) summarizes the right of servicemembers and members of their households, in addition to options available under current law, to continue an existing auto insurance policy as allowed by the insurer with appropriate adjustments that relate only to location risk factors; (2) notifies the servicemember that the insurer will explain the coverage options available to the servicemember as a result of the move; and (3) requires no alterations or additions for an insurer to be in compliance with such notification requirements. </p> <p>Prohibits this Act from requiring an insurer to continue providing coverage to such a member.</p> <p>Provides enforcement authority to the states in which the relevant auto insurance policy was issued or renewed.</p>]]></text>
