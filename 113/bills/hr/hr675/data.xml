  <summary date="2013-04-18T21:01:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Part-Time Worker Bill of Rights Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the large employer health insurance coverage mandate to part-time employees (as well as full-time employees, currently covered).

Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to make an employee eligible for coverage under such Act if that employee has been employed for at least 12 months by a covered employer with respect to whom such leave is requested. (Eliminates the requirement, under current law, that the employee have served at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period before the leave request.)

Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require that certain employees working at less than full-time under participation, vesting, and accrual rules governing pension plans be treated as meeting full-time year-of-service criteria. Qualifies such workers for group health plans. Extends ERISA coverage to certain individuals whose services are leased or contracted for.</summary>
