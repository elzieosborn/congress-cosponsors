  <summary date="2014-09-09T16:32:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Hospice Opportunities for Supporting Patients with Integrity and Care Evaluations (HOSPICE) Act of 2014 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to subject any entity certified as a hospice program to a standard survey by an appropriate state or local survey agency, or an approved accreditation agency, at least once every 36 months.

Specifies funding from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for FY2014-FY2016 for such survey requirements.

Applies certain rules for the limitation of a beneficiary's liability with respect to denial of a Medicare payment for hospice care provided to an individual for more than 180 days in the same manner as such limitation applies with respect to denial of a payment for items and services as not reasonable or necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury.</summary>
