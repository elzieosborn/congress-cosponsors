  <summary date="2014-08-27T22:27:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Living Donor Protection Act of 2014 - Prohibits discrimination based on a person's status as a living organ donor in the offering, issuance, cancellation, coverage, price, or any other condition of a life insurance policy, disability insurance policy, or long-term care insurance policy.

Revises the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to specifically include living organ donation as a serious health condition that entitles a covered employee to leave under that Act.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to update public service announcements, websites, and other media regarding live organ donation to educate the public on the benefits of live organ donation and access to insurance for living organ donors.</summary>
