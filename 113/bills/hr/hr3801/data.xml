  <summary date="2014-02-14T22:48:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Repeals the provision of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 which reduces the cost-of-living adjustment to the retirement pay of members of the Armed Forces who have not attained age 62.

Authorizes the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to establish a general, nationwide mail delivery schedule of five days per week that does not result in nondelivery of mail for more than two consecutive days, including as a result of federal holidays. Requires USPS, if it establishes such a schedule, to allow publishers of newspapers regularly mailed as periodicals access to curbside mailboxes on any day on which it does not deliver mail.

Requires USPS to provide domestic competitive product service six days per week until January 1, 2019, to each street address that was scheduled to receive package service six days per week as of September 30, 2012.</summary>
