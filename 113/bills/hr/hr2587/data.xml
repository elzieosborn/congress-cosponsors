  <summary date="2013-09-06T20:40:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Planting STEM in the Classroom Act - Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop a policy to: (1) encourage federal employees engaged in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) activities to volunteer in STEM education activities by providing them with the administrative leave and support they need to do so; and (2) support increased communication and partnerships between federal scientists and engineers and elementary and secondary schools and teachers through volunteerism in STEM education activities.

Requires each federal science agency to report to Congress on efforts it will make to promote widespread public understanding of career opportunities in the STEM fields specific to the workforce needs of that agency.</summary>
