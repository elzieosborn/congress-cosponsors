  <summary date="2015-03-02T19:36:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Ansel Adams Act - Declares that it is contrary to U.S. public policy to prohibit or restrict photography in public spaces, whether for private, news media, or commercial use.

Requires a federal agency, should it seek to restrict photography of its installations or personnel, to obtain a court order that outlines the national security or other reasons for the restriction. Instructs that such court order shall allow restrictions of such photography when it may lead to the endangerment of public safety or national security.

Prohibits any federal government agency from requiring fees, permits, or insurance as a condition to take still or moving images on federal lands, National Parks and Forests, and public spaces, whether for private, media, or commercial use.

Prohibits federal law enforcement officers or private contractors from seizing any photographic equipment or their contents or memory cards or film nor from ordering a photographer to erase the contents of a camera or memory card or film.</summary>
