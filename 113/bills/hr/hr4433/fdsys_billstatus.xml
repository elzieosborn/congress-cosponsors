        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Forging Peace Through Strength in Ukraine and the Transatlantic Alliance Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the continuing practice by the Russian Federation of physical, diplomatic, and economic aggression toward neighboring countries is clearly intended to undermine regional security and stability; (2) the Russian military build-up and aggressive posture on the eastern border of Ukraine represents an intent to intimidate Ukraine and its citizens to submit to Russian control; (3) the Russian Federation should immediately cease all improper and illegal activities in Ukraine and President Putin should direct an immediate return of Russian forces; (4) the United States reaffirms its commitment to explicitly secure the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and borders of Ukraine; (5) the United States supports the expansion of security cooperation with states in Central and Eastern Europe, including NATO member states, NATO aspirants, and appropriate Eastern Partnership countries; (6) the United States reaffirms support of NATO efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully and diplomatically; and (7) the United States should take immediate steps to enhance its military presence and readiness posture in Europe to deter aggression and assure its allies and partners through forward presence and engagement.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) (Secretary) to develop and report on a strategic framework for U.S. security force assistance and cooperation in the European and Eurasian regions.</p> <p>Directs the President to submit a plan to: (1) increase U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities devoted to monitoring the situation in Ukraine; (2) increase U.S. intelligence information sharing and situational awareness to the maximum extent practicable with Ukraine utilizing appropriate bilateral channels and the NATO-Ukraine Commission; (3) provide military advice and technical assistance to the Ukrainian military to enhance their defensive preparations and posture; (4) convene NATO member states and Ukraine to review options and implement prudent steps to increase the defense of U.S., NATO, and Ukraine cyber networks; and (5) work with NATO member states and the Ukrainian military to counter Russian propaganda.</p> <p>Expresses the sense of Congress in support of the immediate augmentation of U.S. Armed Forces in the area of responsibility of the U.S. European Command in order to meet operational plan requirements for response in support of a NATO ally.
