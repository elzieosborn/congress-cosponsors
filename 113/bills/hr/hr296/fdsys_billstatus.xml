        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Congress is Not a Career Act - Redefines &quot;Member of Congress&quot; under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) with respect to the exclusion from the meaning of &quot;Member&quot; of any Member of the House of Representatives, including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress, who opts out of FERS, but only if he or she served as a Member before the enactment of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2004. Repeals the requirement of service before enactment of such Act. (Thus, allows Members to opt out of FERS benefits regardless of when they have been elected.)</p> <p>Amends the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Agency Contributions requirements to permit a Member of Congress to elect irrevocably, by written notice to the official by whom such Member is paid, not to receive TSP contributions.</p>]]></text>
