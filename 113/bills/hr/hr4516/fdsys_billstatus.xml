Makes any female member of the Marine Corps who graduates from the enlisted infantry course eligible for assignment to an infantry occupational specialty. </p> <p>Requires: (1) the Secretary of the Army to permit female members of the Army to apply to Army Ranger School for leadership training opportunities, and (2) the Secretary of Defense to direct the Special Operations Command to submit to Congress the type of approach and methodology it will be using for the integration of women into the Special Operations Forces.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary of Defense to direct the Secretaries to take immediate steps to ensure that properly designed and fitted combat equipment is available and distributed to female members of the Armed Forces.</p> <p>Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a review of Services' Outreach and Recruitment Efforts gauged toward women representation in the officer corps.</p>]]></text>
