  <summary date="2015-01-08T19:35:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Transportation Connections to Opportunity Act of 2014 - Requires the metropolitan transportation planning process to offer interested parties a reasonable opportunity to participate in the development and consideration of transportation scenarios in a metropolitan planning area. Includes as a national transportation goal an interconnected transportation system which connects people to jobs, schools, and other essential services through a multimodal network. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish a performance measure for use by metropolitan planning organizations in assessing the degree to which a transportation system provides multimodal connections to opportunity, particularly for transportation-disadvantaged populations.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a pilot program in which not more than 10 metropolitan planning organizations develop and deploy measures and targets to improve multimodal connectivity and increase connections for populations with limited transportation options; (2) create and maintain data sets and analysis tools to assist metropolitan planning organizations, states, and the Department of Transportation (DOT) in carrying out performance management analyses; and (3) carry out a broadband infrastructure initiative to expand right-of-way use to accommodate broadband infrastructure (buried or aerial facilities that provide wired or wireless connections to enable users to send and receive data) and improve broadband access in unserved and underserved areas.</summary>
