  <summary date="2013-09-12T15:41:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Refers the bill (H.R. 3068) entitled "Relating to members of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan" to the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for a determination as to whether the tribe and its members have Indian trust-related legal or equitable claims against the United States other than the legal claims pending in such Court on the date of enactment of this resolution.

Directs the chief judge, notwithstanding any statute of limitations, to report back to the House of Representatives providing: (1) findings of fact and conclusions of law to inform Congress of the nature, extent, and character of the Indian-trust related claims of such Band and its tribal members for compensation in such legal or equitable claims against the United States; and (2) the amount, if any, legally or equitably due from the United States to such claimants.</summary>
