  <summary date="2014-12-04T21:42:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Reaffirms U.S. support for the peaceful resolution of maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.

Reaffirms support for freedom of navigation and overflight and condemns coercive actions or the use of force to impede these freedoms in international maritime domains and airspace.

Urges China to refrain from implementing the declared East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone which is contrary to freedom of overflight in international airspace, and to refrain from taking similar provocative actions elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.

Urges the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), U.S. allies and partners, and all claimants to fairly resolve these outstanding disputes, including through developing a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea.

Supports continued U.S. operations to support freedom of navigation in international waters and air space in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.

 Encourages continued U.S. efforts to strengthen regional partnerships to build capacity for maritime domain awareness in support of freedom of navigation, maintenance of peace and stability, and respect for principles of international law.</summary>
