Authorizes the Office to employ the services of outside counsel and other experts for this purpose.\n\nRequires: (1) the chair of the Committee on House Administration to cause to be printed in the Congressional Record a statement setting forth the aggregate amounts expended by the Office on the outside counsel and other experts on a quarterly basis, and (2) the statement to be submitted for printing within 30 days after the expiration of each quarter."
