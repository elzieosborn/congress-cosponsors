        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Authorization for Use of Military Force Against ISIL Resolution - Expresses the sense of Congress that: </p> <ul> <li>the President has rightly committed limited forces in Iraq to protect U.S. diplomatic and military personnel against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL); </li> <li>the President should be commended for authorizing military operations to protect ethnic and religious minorities from ISIL and for providing assistance to prevent a humanitarian disaster; </li> <li>the President should be commended for working with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies to form a coordinated response to ISIL; </li> <li> the President should seek United Nations (U.N.) Security Council consensus prior to pursuing a multilateral military campaign against ISIL, and should endeavor to form a broad coalition of allies, including members of the Arab League; and </li> <li>a negotiated political solution among ethnic groups is the only sure solution to end sectarian violence and reach permanent peace.</li> </ul> <p>Authorizes the President to use the Armed Forces to: </p> <ul> <li>defend U.S. national security against ISIL, and </li> <li>enforce a Security Council resolution adopted on or after the date of the enactment of this joint resolution that provides for multilateral action against ISIL and authorizes a coalition military force under Security Council auspices to degrade ISIL's capacities to commit terrorist acts and destabilize peaceful governments. </li> </ul> <p> Authorizes the President, in the absence of a requested Security Council resolution, to use the Armed Forces to defend U.S. national security against ISIL, other than in direct ground combat operations, upon a certification to Congress and enactment of a joint resolution.</p> <p>Requires expedited congressional consideration of such a joint resolution.</p> <p>Directs the President to report to Congress at least every 60 days on matters relevant to this joint resolution.</p> <p>States that: </p> <ul> <li> the authorization to use military force under this joint resolution is intended to constitute specific authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution, </li> <li>nothing in this joint resolution is intended to limit the President's authority to use military force in self-defense pursuant to the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, and </li> <li>this joint resolution (with a specified exception) shall expire two years after its enactment.</li></ul>]]></text>
