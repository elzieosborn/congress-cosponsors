  <summary date="2022-07-22T11:34:30Z" status="Introduced in House">Authorization for Use of Military Force to defend America's Allies Resolution of 2022

This joint resolution authorizes the President, upon making a determination that Russia has used chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons in the territory of Ukraine, to use the Armed Forces as necessary and appropriate to (1) protect U.S. national security interests with respect to Ukraine, and (2) assist in defending and restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

No later than 48 hours after exercising such authority, the President shall make available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate the President's determination that reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either (1) will not adequately protect U.S. national security interests with respect to Ukraine, or (2) is not likely to defend and restore Ukraine's territorial integrity.</summary>
