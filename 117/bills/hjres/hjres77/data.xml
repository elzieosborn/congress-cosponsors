  <summary date="2022-03-21T10:18:53Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment prohibiting total federal expenditures for a year from exceeding the average annual federal revenue collected in the three prior years, adjusted for changes in population and inflation. Expenditures for payment of debt and revenues derived from borrowing are excluded.

Congress may authorize specific expenditures in excess of the limit for up to one year by declaring an emergency with a roll call vote of two-thirds of each chamber.

The requirements take effect in the first year beginning at least 90 days following ratification, except that expenditures are permitted to exceed the limit by specified amounts during each of the first nine years that the requirements are in effect.</summary>
