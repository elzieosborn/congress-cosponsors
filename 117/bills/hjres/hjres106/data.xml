  <summary date="2023-08-16T18:29:33Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment prohibiting total outlays for a fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal year or 18.5% of the economic output of the United States. The amendment also requires a cancellation of budget authority that is equal to the amount by which total outlays exceeded these limits during the preceding fiscal year.

The amendment requires a three-fourths roll call vote of each chamber of Congress to increase the public debt limit or increase revenue.

The amendment also requires the President to submit an annual budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts.

Congress may waive these requirements due to a declaration of war or a military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security.</summary>
