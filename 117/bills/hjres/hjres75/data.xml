  <summary date="2022-03-15T16:45:02Z" status="Public Law">Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2022

This joint resolution provides continuing FY2022 appropriations to federal agencies through March 15, 2022. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2022 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires on March 11, 2022.

The joint resolution also (1) extends the temporary scheduling order issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration to place fentanyl-related substances in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, and (2) increases the limit on the value of the defense articles and services that the President is authorized to draw down to address unforeseen emergencies.</summary>
