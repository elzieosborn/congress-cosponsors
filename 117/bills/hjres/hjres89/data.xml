  <summary date="2022-07-06T18:00:44Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment specifying that protected speech does not include any financial expenditures, or in kind equivalents, with respect to a candidate for federal office, regardless of whether a communication expressly advocates the election or defeat of a specified candidate in the election.

The amendment gives Congress the power to enact a mandatory public financing system to provide funds to qualified candidates in federal elections, which shall be the sole source of funds raised or spent with respect to federal elections.</summary>
