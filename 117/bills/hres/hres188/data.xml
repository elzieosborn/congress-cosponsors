Certain proceedings regarding journal approval and adjournment shall take place on any legislative day from March 13, 2021, through April 22, 2021.

It shall be in order at any time through the calendar day of April 22, 2021, for the Speaker of the House to suspend the rules.

The resolution waives the two-thirds vote requirement to allow consideration of resolutions reported from the Committee on Rules through the legislative day of April 22, 2021, on the same day they are presented to the House.

The resolution also waives certain procedural requirements for a specified time period regarding journal approval, adjournment, suspension of the rules, and consideration of certain resolutions.

Finally, the resolution revises H. Res. 8 (adopting and modifying the rules of the House for the 117th Congress) to increase the membership of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis from 15 to 16 with 7 instead of 6 of such members being recommended by the minority leader.</summary>
