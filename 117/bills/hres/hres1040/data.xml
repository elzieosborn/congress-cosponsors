  <summary date="2022-07-15T18:29:11Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution supports and encourages Americans who choose to exercise their free speech rights by boycotting companies that do not provide life-saving or health-related goods and services to the Russian people yet continue to operate in Russia.

 The resolution also condemns companies that continue to operate in Russia and provide financial benefits to the Putin regime that enable his ability to continue waging war in Ukraine.

Finally, the resolution commends companies that have already suspended operations in or withdrawn from markets in Russia in response to the Putin regime's unlawful invasion of Ukraine.</summary>
