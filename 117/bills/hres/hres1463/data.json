It also urges relevant federal and state agencies, as well as nongovernmental organizations involved in traffic incident management response to spread awareness and promote the existence of, and adherence to, state move over laws. Move over laws generally require motorists to move at least one lane over when an emergency or rescue activity is taking place on the shoulder or side of the roadway, or, if unable to do so safely, to slow down and pass the scene with caution."
