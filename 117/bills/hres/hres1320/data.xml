  <summary date="2022-12-30T15:18:44Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution remembers the 80th anniversary of the Solomon Islands campaign, including the battles of Guadalcanal and Ironbottom Sound during World War II.

The resolution honors the sailors, soldiers, marines, and airmen that made the ultimate sacrifice for the United States and Allies in the Solomon Islands and the Pacific theater.

The resolution also recognizes the results of their sacrifice, including over three generations of a democratic Indo-Pacific.

Finally, the resolution affirms the critical importance of the U.S. relationship with the Pacific Islands and of U.S.-Pacific Island partnerships to promote democracy, peace, security, and prosperity.</summary>
