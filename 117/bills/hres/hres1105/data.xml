  <summary date="2022-08-09T16:48:13Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution supports the goal of increasing Latino individuals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as a way to promote economic empowerment and sustainability, not only in their community, but in the overall U.S. economy.

The resolution also encourages increased federal support for initiatives aimed at boosting the number of Latino students who pursue STEM education and career paths, particularly engineering.

Finally, the resolution recognizes the important role that Hispanic-serving institutions and all institutions of higher education must play in order to achieve the goal of increasing Latino individuals in STEM.</summary>
