  <summary date="2022-08-17T23:38:07Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution supports the designation of the Year of the Parents.

The resolution also expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that (1) students, parents, local school boards, states, and the federal government should work together to ensure children receive the best education possible; (2) governing authorities should take into consideration students' emotional, mental, and physical health when developing school health policy guidelines; (3) teachers' unions should not direct health policies for schools; (4) individuals who want to may continue to wear a mask or take other precautions; and (5) no federal funds should be dispersed to any public or private school that promotes critical race theory.</summary>
