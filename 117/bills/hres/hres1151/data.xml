  <summary date="2023-08-03T11:17:57Z" status="Passed House">This resolution establishes budget allocations and other budget enforcement requirements that apply in the House of Representatives for FY2023.

Specifically, the resolution establishes

 committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, limitations on advance appropriations, and procedures for exempting emergency spending from the requirements. The resolution also allows certain adjustments to the budgetary levels, including adjustments to accommodate additional spending for

 disaster relief, wildfire suppression, health care fraud and abuse control, continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, and reemployment services and eligibility assessments. The provisions in this resolution expire if a FY2023 budget resolution is adopted by both chambers of Congress.</summary>
