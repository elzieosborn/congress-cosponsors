  <summary date="2022-10-05T15:00:45Z" status="Reported to House">This resolution requests that the President transmit certain information to the House of Representatives related to the June 17, 2022, waiver of intellectual property commitments under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (known as the TRIPS waiver) and the proposed expansion of the TRIPS waiver.

In particular, the resolution requests information demonstrating that

 the TRIPS waiver will increase global supply and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and the extent to which these vaccines have been destroyed due to their expiration; the proposed TRIPS waiver expansion will increase global supply and delivery of COVID-19 diagnostics or therapeutics; the TRIPS waiver or the proposed TRIPS waiver expansion will accelerate the end of the COVID-19 pandemic; and China will not obtain access to patents or other intellectual property related to COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, or therapeutics even if expressly excluded from the TRIPS waiver or the proposed TRIPS waiver expansion.</summary>
