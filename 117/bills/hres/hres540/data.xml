  <summary date="2022-04-04T17:54:53Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that (1) the claims made by the members of the Texas legislature who have fled to the nation's capital from Texas are unfounded at best and deceiving at worst, and (2) their actions have further resulted in their abandonment of their responsibilities and duty to fulfill their oath of office.

The resolution also urges the House Sergeant at Arms, the U.S. Capitol Police, and the Department of Justice to cooperate with the Texas Department of Public Safety in their efforts to return these members to Texas.</summary>
