  <summary date="2022-04-13T16:04:28Z" status="Passed House">This resolution establishes certain budget enforcement procedures and allocations for FY2022 appropriations legislation.

Specifically, the resolution establishes FY2022 budget allocations for the House Appropriations Committee. In addition, the resolution allows the chair of the House Budget Committee to make specified adjustments to the allocations to accommodate additional spending for

 disaster relief, wildfire suppression, Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement, health care fraud and abuse control, and continuing disability reviews and redeterminations. The resolution also includes provisions that address emergency spending and advance appropriations.

The provisions in this resolution expire when a congressional budget resolution for FY2022 is passed by both chambers of Congress.</summary>
