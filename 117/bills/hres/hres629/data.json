    "text": "This resolution condemns racism, xenophobia, discrimination, scapegoating, and ethnic and religious bigotry. It acknowledges the climate of hate that Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Sikh communities have experienced since September 11, 2001, and suggests specified relief to support those affected.\n\nSpecifically, the resolution\n\n calls for the creation of an interagency task force to work with community-based organizations to review government policies that targeted such communities, investigate and document their impact, and dismantle those policies that continue to profile and target such communities; calls for hearings to explore the findings and recommendations of the task force; supports allocating resources to community-based organizations outside and independent of law enforcement that center the experiences and demands of Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Sikh communities to support the needs of victims of hate and state violence and to create alternatives to law enforcement and transformative justice programs that focus on vulnerable populations within these communities; and calls on the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation to work together to study the impact of hate, government targeting, and profiling on physical and mental health."
