  <summary date="2021-04-09T19:22:50Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution calls on the United States to recommit itself to the promotion of disability rights and to the values enshrined in the Prologue Room at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the dedication of the Prologue Room.

The resolution recognizes the important work of the disability community, and the historic campaign championed by that community, that led to the expansion of the memorial to include a statue that clearly and visibly depicts President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a wheelchair.

Finally, the resolution calls on the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation to continue to increase access to the memorial for individuals with disabilities and to support the development of accessible educational materials to ensure awareness is raised about the history of the memorial and disability rights.</summary>
