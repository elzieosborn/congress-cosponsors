  <summary date="2021-05-28T17:22:36Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution declares that (1) the United States needs a Marshall Plan for Moms to revitalize and restore mothers in the workforce; and (2) mothers, especially mothers of color have been pushed to the brink of economic, social, and emotional collapse during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic because of the existing economic and social inequalities women have long faced.

 The resolution also states that any relief and long-term recovery package to address the COVID-19 crisis must recognize and rebuild moms in the workforce by including certain policies such as

 establishing a robust paid leave plan; rebuilding and stabilizing the child care industry; providing necessary child poverty reduction tools for families' economic security that include recurring child benefits and an expanded and improved child tax credit and earned income tax credit; establishing an expanded unemployment insurance program that benefits struggling workers, including those experiencing long-term unemployment; raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour or higher for all minimum wage workers; and providing access to mental health support for mothers. Finally, the resolution declares that employers and policymakers must prioritize addressing the economic cliff facing mothers and make permanent the policies set forth in this resolution so that mothers are protected against any future economic calamities.</summary>
