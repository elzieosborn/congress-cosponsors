    "text": "This resolution impeaches President Donald John Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nSpecifically, the resolution sets forth an article of impeachment stating that President Trump weaponized hate for political gain.\n\nThe article states that, through declarations and conduct prior to and following the security breach at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, President Trump (1) undermined the integrity of his high office; (2) sowed discord among the people of the United States; and (3) violated his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. The article further states that, by such conduct, President Trump warrants immediate impeachment, trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States."
