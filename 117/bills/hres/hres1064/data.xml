  <summary date="2022-11-29T13:55:21Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution temporarily establishes in the House of Representatives the Select Committee on Older Americans, which is comprised of 12 Members appointed by the Speaker (6 of whom shall be appointed on the recommendation of the minority leader).

The select committee must serve as a bipartisan forum to bring awareness to, and advance recommendations to address, economic, health, housing, and other issues facing older adults. The recommendations may not, however, address Medicare or Social Security. The select committee must submit a final report that details its activities within two years after the appointment of its members and terminates on the date it submits the final report.</summary>
