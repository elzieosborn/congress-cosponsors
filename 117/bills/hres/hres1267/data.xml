This includes matters concerning (1) the NIH's determination that the laboratory's research was not anticipated to confer an attribute on a pathogen to enhance its pathogenicity or transmissibility (i.e., gain-of-function research), and (2) the laboratory's standard operating procedures for working with novel coronaviruses.</summary>
