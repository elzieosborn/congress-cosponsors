  <summary date="2022-05-03T17:49:27Z" status="Passed House">This resolution urges the U.S. government, European Union, and other transatlantic partners to increase cooperation and support for Moldova's democratic development, economic and energy independence, and efforts to root out corruption.

The resolution reaffirms that it is U.S. policy to support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Moldova.

The resolution affirms Moldova's right to determine its own partnerships and its right to associate with the European Union or any regional organization.

The resolution commends Moldova's efforts to take in Ukrainian refugees and urges increased assistance by the United States and other allies and partners to Moldova to assist with those efforts.

The resolution reaffirms the importance of free, fair, and transparent elections in Moldova.

The resolution calls upon the government of Russia to

 fulfill its commitments made at the Istanbul summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1999, withdraw its military forces and munitions from Moldova, refrain from issuing military and economic threats or exerting pressure against Moldova, and cease any and all actions that support separatists in the region of Transnistria. The resolution supports efforts to resolve the Transnistria conflict through a comprehensive settlement that secures Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Finally, this resolution affirms that lasting stability and security in Moldova is in the strategic interest of the United States and can only be achieved if the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Moldova and all other European countries are respected.</summary>
