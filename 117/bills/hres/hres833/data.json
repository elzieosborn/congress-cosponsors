The resolution supports efforts to resolve the Transnistria conflict through a comprehensive settlement that secures Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nFinally, this resolution affirms that lasting stability and security in Moldova is in the strategic interest of the United States and can only be achieved if the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Moldova and all other European countries are respected."
