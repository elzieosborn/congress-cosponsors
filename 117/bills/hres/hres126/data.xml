  <summary date="2021-03-03T21:47:12Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses support for (1) the designation of International Flower Workers' Day to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to practices that respect labor rights in other countries, and (2) the elimination of exploitative labor practices as a key U.S. policy goal.

Further, the resolution urges the governments of Colombia and other flower-producing countries to investigate and respond to the social and environmental impacts of the flower-producing industry, and it notes that the Colombian Action Plan Related to Labor Rights has not adequately strengthened or improved working conditions in Colombia.

The resolution also encourages the development and implementation of new measures to uphold and fulfill the strong labor commitments made under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.</summary>
