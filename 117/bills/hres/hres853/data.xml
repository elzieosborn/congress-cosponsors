  <summary date="2022-04-11T16:31:15Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution calls on the United States to increase support for and work with international partners, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), to address the education and health needs of every child as the world recovers and rebuilds from the global pandemic.

The resolution urges the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, and other agencies to work with UNICEF and other partners to reimagine basic education programs in foreign assistance and to ensure access across childhood from the earliest years through adolescence.

The resolution urges the U.S. government to reinforce its diplomatic efforts with the international community to increase global support for the pandemic response in low- and middle-income countries, especially to promote greater vaccine equity across sub-Saharan Africa.

Finally, the resolution urges the United States to support Giga, a global initiative to connect every school to the internet and every young person to educational resources and opportunities.</summary>
