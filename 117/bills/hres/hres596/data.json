    "text": "This resolution impeaches President Joseph R. Biden for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nSpecifically, the resolution sets forth one article of impeachment specifying that President Biden usurped the legislative authority of Congress and one article of impeachment specifying that President Biden disregarded and circumvented the judicial authority of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe first article states that President Biden, through an order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extending the moratorium on residential evictions through October 3, 2021, demonstrated his manifest disrespect for Congress, the American people, and the rule of law.\n\nThe second article states that President Biden empowered the CDC to extend the moratorium in direct contravention of Justice Kavanaugh's concurring opinion that the eviction moratorium via executive order exceeded the CDC's statutory authority.\n\nThe articles further state that by such conduct, President Biden warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States."
