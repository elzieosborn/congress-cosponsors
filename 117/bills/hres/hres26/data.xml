  <summary date="2021-01-12T18:49:03Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution impeaches President Donald John Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors.

Specifically, the resolution sets forth two articles of impeachment stating that President Trump has abused the powers of the presidency.

The first article states that, using the powers of his office, President Trump sought to threaten, intimidate, and solicit the Secretary of State of Georgia to acquiesce to his demand to find enough votes to make him the winner of Georgia's presidential election, even though the votes in Georgia had already been counted three times in favor of his opponent. The article further states that, by doing so, President Trump actively undermined public faith and confidence in the integrity of American elections, subverted the rule of law, and placed his personal interests above the national interest.

The second article states that President Trump has endeavored to undermine foundations of U.S. democracy, indicating an intention to make himself an authoritarian ruler who is unaccountable to the U.S. people. The article specifies the following actions by President Trump:

 refusing to acknowledge, and opposing efforts to protect against, Russian interference in U.S. affairs; expressing willingness to accept foreign assistance to win reelection; refusing to accept the results of the election; undermining the ability of American citizens to exercise their rights as voters; falsely alleging widespread voting fraud while producing no evidence; inciting his supporters to believe falsely that the election had been stolen from him; and failing to take action to protect federal officers, personnel, property, and institutions on January 6, 2021, when the Capitol was besieged by his supporters. Both articles state that, by such conduct, President Trump warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold U.S. office.</summary>
