  <summary date="2022-12-06T15:56:03Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution recognizes

 the contributions of African Americans to the musical heritage of the United States; the wide array of talented and popular African-American musical artists, composers, songwriters, and musicians who are underrecognized for contributions to music; the achievements, talent, and hard work of African-American pioneer artists and the obstacles that those artists overcame to gain recognition; and the need for African-American students to have greater access to, and participation in, music education in schools across the United States. The resolution also supports the designation of an African-American Music Appreciation Month.

Finally, the resolution recognizes Black History Month and an African-American Music Appreciation Month as an important time to celebrate the impact of the African-American musical heritage on the musical heritage of the United States.</summary>
