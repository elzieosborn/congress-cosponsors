  <summary date="2022-06-06T14:23:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that (1) BridgeUSA exchange programs are vital to the economy and national interests of the United States, (2) BridgeUSA should continue with robust support from the Department of State to further those national interests, and (3) the processing of J-1 BridgeUSA visas should be prioritized at U.S. Embassies and consulates to ensure the program's public diplomacy goals are met.

It also expresses that Congress and implementing partners should be consulted on any major changes to BridgeUSA programs given the significant national security and economic impacts of the program.</summary>
