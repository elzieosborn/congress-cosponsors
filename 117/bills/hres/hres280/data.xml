  <summary date="2021-04-16T17:24:50Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution commits to the use of competitive free market and free trade policies to combat national security threats caused by China and its attacks on the U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing base.

The resolution urges the United States to (1) remove tax, regulatory, and debt burdens and barriers that have weakened this base; (2) empower the U.S. Trade Representative to take specified actions to counter harmful and unfair trade practices by China; (3) address shortcomings in Food and Drug Administration data collection related to foreign-sourced pharmaceutical ingredients; and (4) identify and streamline regulatory hurdles that have impeded the U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing base.</summary>
