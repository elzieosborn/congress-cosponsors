  <summary date="2022-08-10T18:15:59Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution states that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should, to the extent scientifically and legally possible, integrate the process behind Operation Warp Speed into FDA operations. (Operation Warp Speed was a partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense to coordinate federal efforts to accelerate the development of COVID-19 medical countermeasures, including vaccines.)

The resolution also states that the FDA should issue guidance identifying ways to accelerate drug and biological product development through clinical trials and the approval and licensure processes.</summary>
