This resolution also calls on (1) the President to refrain from taking actions inconsistent with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the U.S. Constitution; and (2) state and local governments to overturn existing laws and oppose new laws that impact Americans' ability to exercise their religion, including laws on sexual orientation and gender identity.</summary>
