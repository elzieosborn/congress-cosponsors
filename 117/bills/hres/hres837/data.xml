  <summary date="2022-05-09T16:34:44Z" status="Passed House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the case of Peng Shuai is directly related to broader international concerns around the freedom of speech and safety of athletes participating in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.

The resolution also expresses that the role of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in legitimizing China's claims about Peng's safety raises questions about the IOC's ability and willingness to protect the rights of athletes participating in the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic games in Beijing.

Finally, the resolution expresses that China should (1) provide independent and verifiable proof of Peng's whereabouts and that she is safe, (2) allow Peng to engage directly with the Women's Tennis Association and the United Nations to independently verify her safety and explain her absence from public life since making her allegation, (3) open an independent and transparent investigation into Peng's allegations against former senior Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, (4) publicly commit to holding sexual violence abusers accountable, (5) cease all censorship of reporting and discussions of Peng's case, and (6) allow Peng to leave China if she so desires and not retaliate against her family members who remain there.</summary>
