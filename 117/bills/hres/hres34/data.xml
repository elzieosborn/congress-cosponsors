  <summary date="2021-01-12T19:30:14Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution impeaches President Donald John Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors.

Specifically, the resolution sets forth four articles of impeachment.

The first article states that President Trump abused the powers of the presidency by inciting an insurrection against the U.S. government. The article specifies a pattern of conduct by President Trump, including the following:

 spreading disinformation and unsupported allegations of voter fraud; appealing to and defending white supremacists; and encouraging his supporters to descend on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, while Congress certified the results of the presidential election, leading to destruction and death. The second article states that President Trump abused the powers of the presidency by corrupting the electoral process. The article specifies the following conduct by President Trump:

 soliciting a foreign government (Ukraine) to intervene in the 2020 presidential election; soliciting the Secretary of State of Georgia to overturn election results in Georgia; and during the 2016 presidential election, making unlawful payments to silence persons with unfavorable information about him. The third article states that President Trump has accepted emoluments, including from foreign states, and, in doing so, has violated anti-corruption provisions of the Constitution and used the power of the presidency for improper personal gain.

The fourth article states that President Trump has obstructed justice by, for example, directing the firing of the Special Counsel who was investigating him in 2017 and later ordering federal officials to lie about this directive.

Each article states that, by such conduct, President Trump warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification from holding U.S. office.</summary>
