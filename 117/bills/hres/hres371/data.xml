  <summary date="2021-10-19T15:13:45Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution reaffirms the commitment of the United States to certain legislation and reassurances relating to the unofficial U.S.-Taiwan relationship. It also reaffirms the commitment of the United States to continued diplomatic and military coordination with Taiwan and condemns the Chinese government's military escalations toward Taiwan.

(China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and, as a result, the United States has an unofficial relationship with Taiwan.)</summary>
