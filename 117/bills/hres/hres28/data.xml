  <summary date="2021-01-13T18:54:20Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that President Donald Trump did knowingly and purposefully incite a violent and unlawful insurrection against the United States and that action should be taken to prosecute or sanction any individual who participated in or facilitated this insurrection, including Members of Congress. Further, the resolution urges the establishment of a commission to investigate all factors leading up to the breach of the U.S. Capitol and the Capitol Complex and to provide recommendations to prevent a similar event from occurring again.</summary>
