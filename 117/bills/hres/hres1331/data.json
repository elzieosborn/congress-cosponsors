    "text": "Moving Our Democracy and Congressional Operations Towards Modernization Resolution of 2022\n\nThis resolution implements recommendations made by the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.\n\nThe recommendations include\n\n enhancing bipartisan collaboration by, for example, establishing a space in the U.S. Capitol for bipartisan gathering and encouraging committees to experiment with alternative hearing formats; revising various administrative matters, such as authorizing the use of bulk purchases for supplies and services for Member offices, requiring offices to establish continuity of operations plans, and implementing secure information transfer practices; supporting efforts related to workforce and human resource management in the House; and improving accessibility of congressional spaces and websites for individuals with disabilities. The resolution also requires (1) reevaluating the method of calculating Representational Allowances (funds provided to Members for operating their offices and carrying out their official and representational duties), and (2) publishing information about the expenditures and staffing of eligible Congressional Member Organizations (groups of Members that register with the Committee on House Administration in support of a common legislative objective)."
