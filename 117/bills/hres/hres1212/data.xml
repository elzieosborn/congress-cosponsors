  <summary date="2022-07-26T16:12:09Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense that every person has the right to travel freely within the United States and that no one should be held criminally or civilly liable for seeking, providing, or assisting with out-of-state health care services that are legal in the jurisdiction in which they are delivered.

It also expresses the sense that those whose rights are violated may seek relief through Section 1983 lawsuits (Section 1983 is a federal statute that allows individuals to sue state or local government actors for violations of constitutional rights).</summary>
