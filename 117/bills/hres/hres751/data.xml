  <summary date="2022-04-05T16:19:18Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution recognizes the value and importance of the work being done by the six Palestinian civil society organizations defending the human rights of a vulnerable and at-risk Palestinian population living under Israeli military occupation.

The resolution also condemns as a repressive act designed to criminalize and persecute important Palestinian human rights organizations the decision by the Israeli government to designate six prominent Palestinian human rights and civil society groups as terrorist organizations.

Finally, the resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that President Biden and the Department of State should publicly

 condemn this authoritarian and antidemocratic act of repression by the Israeli government against prominent Palestinian civil society organizations; call on Israeli authorities to immediately end efforts aimed at persecuting, delegitimizing, and criminalizing Palestinian human rights defenders and civil society organizations; and state the ongoing U. S. commitment to recognize the valuable work of Palestinian civil society organizations.</summary>
