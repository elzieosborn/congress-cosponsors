  <summary date="2022-01-07T18:00:06Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution acknowledges and condemns the discrimination against, wrongful termination of, and exclusion from the federal civil service, the Foreign Service, and the Armed Forces of the thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals who were affected by the anti-LGBT policies of the federal government.

The resolution expresses that the House of Representatives, on behalf of the United States, apologizes to the affected LGBT military service members, Foreign Service members, veterans, and federal civil service employees and their families.

Finally, the resolution reaffirms the commitment of the federal government to treat all military service members, Foreign Service members, veterans, and federal civil service employees and retirees, including LGBT individuals, with equal respect and fairness.</summary>
