    "text": "This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that it is U.S. policy to recognize that\n\n a weapon of mass destruction designation of illicit fentanyl by the federal government would empower the government to go after international trafficking syndicates and root out illicit manufacturers and traffickers to take action to stop fentanyl from reaching the border; and such a designation of illicit fentanyl would not hinder the use of legal fentanyl or stop ongoing recovery, treatment, and harm-reduction efforts to assist those residents of the United States currently suffering from substance use disorder. Finally, the resolution urges President Biden and the Department of Homeland Security to officially designate illicit fentanyl and analogues, including carfentanil, as a weapon of mass destruction."
