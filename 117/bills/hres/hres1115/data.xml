  <summary date="2022-10-31T22:16:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Congress Observing Police Service Resolution or the COPS Resolution

This resolution urges each sitting Member of the House of Representatives to participate in one shift in a passenger seat of a law enforcement vehicle observing the work day of a local law enforcement officer each session of Congress.

The Committee on House Administration shall promulgate regulations to carry out this resolution, including regulations (1) waiving such requirement for any Member who is physically incapable of participating in such a ride-along, and (2) requiring such Committee to maintain a readily available, public list that identifies whether a Member completed such a ride-along for each session of Congress.

If the Committee on Ethics determines that a Member has not satisfied the requirement to participate in a ride-along for the previous session of the Congress and such requirement has not been waived, the Committee shall fine such Member $200.</summary>
