The resolution urges elected officials and policymakers in Moldova to build upon the practices of recent free and fair elections to further bolster legitimate and equitable election processes in their nation.

Finally, this resolution calls for all personnel and equipment belonging to Russian security or armed forces to withdraw from Moldova.</summary>
