  <summary date="2022-04-19T21:40:33Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses support for the designation of National Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Day. Triple-negative breast cancer is a distinct form of cancer that does not have the hormone and protein receptors commonly found in breast cancer. As a result, triple-negative breast cancer does not respond to hormone therapy or medicines that target those receptors.</summary>
