  <summary date="2023-07-31T14:37:31Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution recognizes the significance of the 70th anniversary of Miller v. Board of Education of District of Columbia, in which the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that the District had a duty to provide equal educational facilities within the District for Black deaf children as for White deaf children (in accordance with the Supreme Court's holding in Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada that a state may not provide educational facilities within its boundary for one race and send the other outside the state to receive the same course of instruction).</summary>
