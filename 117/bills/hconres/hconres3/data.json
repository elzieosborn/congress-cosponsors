    "text": "This concurrent resolution censures President Donald J. Trump for actions described in this resolution, including attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election and inciting insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe resolution calls upon President Trump to\n\n acknowledge that President-elect Joseph R. Biden was the victor of the election and that President-elect Biden will be the lawful President on January 20, 2021; call on his supporters not to engage in violence; disavow the actions of the insurrectionists who attacked the U.S. Capitol; and denounce any further acts of violence, including any planned to occur surrounding the 58th Presidential Inauguration. Finally, it finds that, in engaging in the above cited actions, President Trump \"as an officer of the United States ... engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [United States], or [gave] aid or comfort to the enemies thereof,\" as described in Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, making him ineligible for future office, unless Congress, in the future, removes such disability by a two-thirds vote of each chamber."
