  <summary date="2022-07-22T10:48:11Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution expresses the sense of Congress that

 those individuals who are responsible for the sexual war crimes on April 14, 1999, against U.S. citizen Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman in Kosovo should be brought to justice as per U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1820 and 2467, it is reprehensible that no individuals have been found guilty for their sexual war crimes against Ms. Krasniqi Goodman, and progress in resolving Ms. Krasniqi Goodman's case and those involving other survivors of sexual violence during the Kosovo war should remain an important bilateral priority between the United States and the government of Serbia.</summary>
