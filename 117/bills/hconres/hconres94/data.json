Security Council Resolutions 1820 and 2467, it is reprehensible that no individuals have been found guilty for their sexual war crimes against Ms. Krasniqi Goodman, and progress in resolving Ms. Krasniqi Goodman's case and those involving other survivors of sexual violence during the Kosovo war should remain an important bilateral priority between the United States and the government of Serbia."
