The resolution censures and condemns President Trump for trying to unlawfully overturn the 2020 presidential election and violating his oath of office on January 6, 2021. It affirms that Joseph R. Biden, Jr. was duly elected as the 46th President on November 3, 2020; was certified as the winner of the election by a Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021; and will be lawfully sworn into office on January 20, 2021.</summary>
