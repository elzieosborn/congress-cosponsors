  <summary date="2021-08-02T17:59:55Z" status="Introduced in House">This concurrent resolution urges all Americans to continue to observe the National Moment of Remembrance to honor the approximately 1.3 million members of the Armed Forces who have lost their lives in war from 1775 to 2021.

The concurrent resolution also recognizes (1) that Memorial Day is a day to commemorate and honor military personnel who never returned home, and (2) that representative governance of the people of the United States would not be possible without the bravery of those members of the Armed Forces who are honored on Memorial Day.</summary>
