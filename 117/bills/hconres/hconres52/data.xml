  <summary date="2022-08-17T18:10:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2021

This concurrent resolution sets forth a framework for automatically providing continuing appropriations to prevent a government shutdown if any appropriations measure for a fiscal year has not been enacted before the fiscal year begins or a joint resolution making continuing appropriations is not in effect.

For an initial 90-day period, the framework would provide continuing appropriations at 99% of the rate for the preceding year to continue programs, projects, and activities for which funds were provided in the preceding fiscal year. It would then reduce the continuing appropriations by 1% after the first 90-day period and by an additional 1% for each subsequent 90-day period until the applicable appropriations legislation is enacted.</summary>
