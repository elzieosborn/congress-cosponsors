  <summary date="2023-08-15T17:35:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This concurrent resolution condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its ongoing support of proxy militias in the region. The concurrent resolution also states that these actions pose a direct threat to international peace and security and run contrary to Russia's responsibilities and obligations as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.

The concurrent resolution urges the President to direct the U.S. representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to take all necessary steps to remove Russia as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.

 Finally, the concurrent resolution urges other member states to support such efforts to hold Russia accountable at the United Nations.</summary>
