  <summary date="2021-09-17T13:46:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Promoting Access to Capital in Underbanked Communities Act of 2021

This bill eliminates and reduces certain requirements applicable to new financial institutions, certain rural community banks, and federal savings associations.

Federal banking agencies must issue rules allowing new financial institutions three years to meet capital requirements. During this period, a financial institution may request to deviate from an approved business plan and the appropriate agency has 30 days to approve or deny the request.

The community bank leverage ratio&#8212;a way of evaluating debt levels&#8212;is reduced for certain rural community banks. Specifically, new rural community banks must have a ratio of 8%, with a three-year phase-in of the rate. Currently, the ratio is 8.5%.

The bill removes certain restrictions to allow federal savings associations to invest in, sell, or otherwise deal in agricultural loans.</summary>
