Furthermore, a depository institution or an SEC-registered securities broker or dealer may not process funds transfers (1) to or from China, or (2) for the benefit of CCP members.\n\nThe bill provides various waivers and exceptions to the required sanctions and prohibitions, such as an exception for certain U.S. intelligence activities."
