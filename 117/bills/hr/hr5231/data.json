Specifically, it extends the credit for a five-year period after an employer plan for payment of family and medical leave benefits is established. The bill also provides for an increased credit for plans established by certain small employers (i.e., employers with gross receipts not exceeding $25 million and 50 or fewer employees during the taxable year)."
