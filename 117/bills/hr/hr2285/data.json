The mechanism must be based on the recommendation of the Government Accountability Office in the report published on January 7, 2021, titled Aircraft Noise: Better Information Sharing Could Improve Responses to Washington, D.C. Area Helicopter Noise Concerns.\n\nThe bill also requires any helicopter operator operating in the Washington, DC area to provide helicopter noise complaint data to the FAA through such established mechanism."
