  <summary date="2022-02-01T22:02:48Z" status="Introduced in House">STOP II: Classrooms Over Conference Rooms Act

This bill increases the authorization of appropriations for FY2022-FY2028 for the Secure Our Schools grant program. The program provides grants to states, local governments, and Indian tribes to improve security, including the placement and use of metal detectors and other deterrent measures, at schools and on school grounds.

The bill requires any funds appropriated under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which may be used for renting conference rooms in the District of Columbia with respect to the administration of federal education programs, to instead be used for the Secure Our Schools grant program.</summary>
