  <summary date="2023-07-28T20:56:06Z" status="Introduced in House">Telehealth Benefit Expansion for Workers Act of 2022

This bill expands the exception for stand-alone telehealth benefits plans from certain requirements that generally apply to private health insurance plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Under the bill, employers may offer stand-alone telehealth benefits to all employees. This includes employees who are eligible for enrollment in their employer's group health plan.

Currently, employers may offer telehealth benefits to employees who are otherwise ineligible for the employer's group health plan. This flexibility applies during any plan year beginning before the end of the COVID-19 emergency.</summary>
