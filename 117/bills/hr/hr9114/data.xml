This bill requires the Department of the Interior to establish the Native American Millennium Challenge Demonstration Project to provide economic development assistance to remote Native American communities.

Specifically, an eligible entity (e.g., a consortium of Native organizations in a noncontiguous state) must enter into a five-year binding agreement (i.e., a compact) with the United States to receive assistance. Among other elements, the agreement must contain a description of the specific objectives related to sustainable economic development and poverty reduction that the entity expects to achieve.

Further, assistance shall be provided in the form of funding agreements and may not be provided as loans. Additionally, funds may not be used for regulated gaming activities.</summary>
