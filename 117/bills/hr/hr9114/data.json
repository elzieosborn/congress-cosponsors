Among other elements, the agreement must contain a description of the specific objectives related to sustainable economic development and poverty reduction that the entity expects to achieve.\n\nFurther, assistance shall be provided in the form of funding agreements and may not be provided as loans. Additionally, funds may not be used for regulated gaming activities."
