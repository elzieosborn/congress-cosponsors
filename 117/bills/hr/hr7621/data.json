DOD must also appoint a general counsel to assist the coordinator with such duties.\n\nThe coordinator must annually submit to Congress a report on civilian harm resulting from U.S. military operations during the preceding year.\n\nDOD must make publicly available in an electronic format a detailed list of all ex gratia payments (i.e., payments that are not legally required) and other payments in response to civilian harm paid by the United States. Some information may be excluded to ensure safety or privacy of payment recipients. DOD must provide specified information to Congress to certify the need for confidentiality.\n\nDOD must provide an easily accessible electronic method by which individuals may request ex gratia or other condolence payments."
