This bill allows meat and meat food products inspected by State Meat and Poultry Inspection programs to be sold in interstate commerce. Under the inspection program, the Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service allows states that meet certain requirements to inspect meat and meat food products. The state-inspected products are currently limited to intrastate commerce, unless a state opts into a separate Cooperative Interstate Shipment Program.</summary>
