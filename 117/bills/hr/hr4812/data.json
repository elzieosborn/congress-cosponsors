In addition, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response may coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security in establishing a system that alerts clinicians and public health officials to emerging health threats in border areas.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must evaluate commission and council activities every two years."
