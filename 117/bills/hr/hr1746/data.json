    "text": "Advanced Nuclear Deployment Act\n\nThis bill sets forth requirements to provide for the rapid deployment of new nuclear reactors.\n\nSpecifically, the bill excludes from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) fees preapplication activities and review of an application for an early site permit to demonstrate an advanced nuclear reactor on a Department of Energy (DOE) or Department of Defense site.\n\nThe NRC must also develop and implement (1) risk-informed and performance-based strategies and guidance to license and regulate micro-reactors, and (2) schedules to complete review activities applicable to the licensing of micro-reactors within two years.\n\nIn addition, the NRC must establish and carry out an expedited procedure for issuing a combined license to construct a new nuclear reactor on or adjacent to a site that already has an existing reactor.\n\nFinally, the bill establishes a pilot program that allows DOE to make long-term power purchase agreements for power generated by commercial nuclear reactors."
