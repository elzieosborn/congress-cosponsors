(Unless otherwise specified, the extensions referred to in this summary are effective through December 16, 2022.)\n\n(Sec. 3) This section provides that references to this Act included in any division of this act refer only to the provisions of the division unless the act expressly provides otherwise.\n\n(Sec. 4) This section provides appropriations for a payment to Dean Swihart, the beneficiary of the late Representative Jacqueline Walorski-Swihart. (A gratuity equal to one year's salary has long been given to the heirs or beneficiaries of Members of Congress who die in office.)\n\n DIVISION A--CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2023\n\nContinuing Appropriations Act, 2023 \n\nThis division provides continuing FY2023 appropriations to federal agencies through the earlier of December 16, 2022, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act.\n\nIt is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2023 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2023 begins on October 1, 2022.\n\nThe CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2022 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.\n\n(Sec. 101) This section provides FY2023 appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects or activities at the levels and under the conditions included in specified FY2022 appropriations acts.\n\nThe section extends several immigration-related programs and specifies several exceptions. It also includes a provision that provides additional funding for the Administration for Children and Families to carry out the Unaccompanied Children Program.\n\n(Sec. 102) This section prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) from funding new or accelerated production of certain projects and other activities and certain multiyear procurements prior to the enactment of the regular annual appropriations act.\n\n(Sec. 103) This section specifies that funds provided by Section 101 of this division shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided in the pertinent appropriations act.\n\n(Sec. 104) This section prohibits appropriations provided by Section 101 of this division from being used to initiate or resume any project or activity that was not funded during FY2022.\n\n(Sec. 105) This section specifies that appropriations provided by the CR are to be used to conduct FY2023 activities and programs during the period of the CR.\n\n(Sec. 106) This section continues the appropriations provided by this division through the earlier of December 16, 2022, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act.\n\n(Sec. 107) This section requires expenditures for activities funded in this division to be charged to the full-year appropriations bill and relevant account when the applicable appropriations bill becomes law.\n\n(Sec. 108) This section waives the normal time limitations for submission and approval of apportionments of accounts funded in annual appropriations acts.\n\n(Sec. 109) This section limits disbursements for programs that would otherwise have high initial rates of operation or would complete distribution of funding at the beginning of the fiscal year if those actions would impinge on final congressional funding prerogatives.\n\n(Sec. 110) This section requires this division to be implemented so that only the most limited funding action permitted by this division is taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities.\n\n(Sec. 111) This section continues funding for certain appropriated entitlements and mandatory payments with budget authority provided in an FY2022 appropriations act at the rate necessary to maintain program levels under current law.

It also addresses other related issues, such as modifying the formulas for calculating such user fees and reauthorizing various programs. (The FDA collects user fees from various entities, including companies that produce drugs and medical devices. The total amounts generated by each user fee program are set out in statutes. Generally, the FDA negotiates these user fees with the relevant industry every five years.)\n\nTITLE I--FEES RELATING TO DRUGS\n\nPrescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022\n\n(Sec. 1002) This section modifies various definitions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Specifically, it modifies the definition of human drug application to include applications for certain allergenic extract products licensed on or after October 1, 2022.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing the prescription drug program fee, if a drug manufacturer makes a request for a particular prescription drug to be placed on the list for discontinued drugs, the FDA shall consider the drug discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later.\n\nThis section also establishes a statutory definition for skin-test diagnostic product.

For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments. (The base revenue and various adjustments set the total amount of user fees that the FDA must collect through the particular user fee program each fiscal year.)\n\nFor the purposes of setting drug user fees, the FDA must make various adjustments including (1) increasing the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjusting the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees for FY2021.\n\nThis section also establishes that a human drug application for a skin-test diagnostic product shall not be subject to certain fees.\n\nFurthermore, this section establishes a rule for fees for an approved human prescription drug that was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the same fiscal year. Generally, the relevant manufacturers of such a drug must pay the annual prescription drug program fee for that fiscal year, if the manufacturer has had a human drug application or supplement pending before the FDA after September 1, 1992.\n\nThis section also modifies exemptions to the prescription drug program fees for certain drugs. Specifically, this section exempts from such fees (1) certain large volume parenteral products, (2) drugs that are pharmaceutically equivalent to certain FDA-approved drugs, and (3) skin-test diagnostic products.\n\n(Sec. 1005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.\n\nTITLE II--FEES RELATING TO DEVICES\n\nMedical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022\n\n(Sec. 2002) This section amends the statutory definition of process for the review of device applications to include activities related to de novo classification requests.

For example, the section establishes the total revenue amounts to be generated from such fees for each fiscal year through FY2027.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating such user fees, this section also authorizes increases for various purposes. For example, for FY2025-FY2027, the base establishment registration fee amounts shall be increased by specified amounts to meet improved performance goals for reviewing certain medical device applications. Other adjustments required by this section include decreases in the amount to be collected for such user fees if (1) the FDA's hiring to support the medical device application process is below certain thresholds, or (2) operating reserves for medical device application review operations exceed certain thresholds.\n\n(Sec. 2005) This section permanently reauthorizes and modifies a program under which accredited testing laboratories are involved in assessing whether a medical device complies with certain statutory requirements. Currently, such a laboratory shall assess whether a device conforms to the relevant requirements. Under this section, a laboratory shall conduct tests to support such assessments.\n\n(Sec. 2006) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, a program that allows accredited persons to review reports and make recommendations to the FDA pertaining to the initial classification of medical devices.\n\n(Sec. 2007) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to medical devices, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.\n\nTITLE III--FEES RELATING TO GENERIC DRUGS Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022\n\n(Sec. 3002) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses generic drug user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue amount and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year for the particular user fee program.\n\nThe FDA must establish a capacity planning methodology to meet the resource capacity needed for the FDA's human generic drug activities and increase the revenue collected under this user fee program accordingly.\n\nThe FDA may also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's human generic drug activities. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.\n\n(Sec. 3004) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to human generic drugs, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.\n\nTITLE IV--FEES RELATING TO BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS\n\nBiosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022\n\n(Sec. 4002) This section amends the definition of biosimilar biological product application to include a qualifying application for an allergenic extract product. Currently, applications for allergenic extract products are specifically excluded from the definition.\n\n(Sec. 4003) This section modifies the method by which the FDA assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through FY2027 the FDA's authority to assess and collect such fees. For example, this section establishes through FY2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments to set the total amount that the FDA must collect each fiscal year through the user fee program.\n\nFor the purposes of setting such user fees, the FDA must (1) increase the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjust the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the FDA used to set such fees in FY2021.\n\nThe FDA must also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year if doing so is necessary to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the FDA's review of biosimilar biological product applications. If the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the FDA must reduce the user fees accordingly.\n\nThe section also makes other changes to the biosimilar user fees, including by (1) authorizing the FDA to administratively remove from the biosimilar biological product development program a person who has failed to pay the required fee for two consecutive years, and (2) eliminating the biosimilar biological product fee.\n\nFurthermore, for the purposes of assessing the biosimilar biological product program fee, if a biosimilar product manufacturer makes a request for a particular biosimilar product to be placed on a list for discontinued products, the FDA shall consider the product discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later.\n\nIf an approved biosimilar product was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the fiscal year, the manufacturer of the product must pay the annual biosimilar biological product program fee for that fiscal year.\n\n(Sec. 4005) This section repeals a provision that terminates (1) on October 1, 2022, the FDA's authority to assess and collect user fees relating to biosimilar biological products, and (2) reporting requirements related to such authority.\n\nTITLE V--REAUTHORIZATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n(Sec. 5001) This section reauthorizes a National Institutes of Health program to (1) develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, and (2) award funds to entities with expertise in conducting research regarding such needs.\n\n(Sec. 5002) This section reauthorizes through December 17, 2022, the humanitarian device exemption program, which authorizes the FDA to, for the purposes of an application for approval to market a medical device, waive certain effectiveness requirements for an eligible device designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects no more than 8,000 individuals in the United States. Specifically, a request for such an exemption must be submitted on or before December 17, 2022.\n\n(Sec. 5003) This section reauthorizes a program that provides grants or contracts to nonprofit consortia for demonstration projects to promote pediatric device development.\n\n(Sec. 5004) This section reauthorizes a provision that allows an applicant for market approval for an eligible single-enantiomer drug to make an election that may qualify the drug for a five-year market exclusivity period.\n\n(Sec. 5005) This section reauthorizes the Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships, through which the FDA may enter into collaborative agreements with eligible entities to develop projects designed to achieve certain goals, such as fostering medical product innovation and accelerating medical product development.\n\n(Sec. 5006) This section reauthorizes an FDA program that provides grants to defray the costs of developing drugs, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases or conditions.\n\n(Sec. 5007) This section extends through December 17, 2022, a provision requiring the FDA to accredit persons to inspect facilities that manufacture certain classes of medical devices.\n\n(Sec. 5008) This section reauthorizes a provision requiring the FDA to post on its website quarterly reports with information on received generic drug applications and priority review applications.\n\nDIVISION G--HERMIT'S PEAK/CALF CANYON FIRE ASSISTANCE ACT\n\nHermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act\n\nThis division provides for monetary compensation to the persons injured by the prescribed fire burn in the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico that became a wildfire known as the Hermit's Peak Fire or the Hermit's Peak Fire/Calf Canyon Fire.\n\nEach person injured as a result the Hermit's Peak Fire shall be eligible to receive monetary compensation from the United States, including for personal injury, loss of property, business loss, or financial loss.\n\nAn Office of Hermit's Peak Fire Claims is established within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to receive, process, and pay claims from persons injured by the fire.\n\nFEMA or the independent claims manager (which FEMA may appoint) shall, on behalf of the United States, investigate, consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, grant, deny, or settle any claim for money damages asserted by a person injured by the Hermit's Peak Fire.\n\nAny claimant aggrieved by a final decision of FEMA concerning compensation may, not later than 60 days after the date on which the decision is issued, bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico to modify or set aside the decision."
