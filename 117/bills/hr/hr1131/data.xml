  <summary date="2021-04-07T19:14:13Z" status="Introduced in House">China Technology Transfer Control Act of 2021

This bill controls exports of certain national interest technology and intellectual property to China.

Specifically, covered technology or intellectual property includes items that (1) would contribute significantly to the Chinese military to the detriment of U.S. national security, (2) are included in a designated list of product components compiled by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), or (3) are used by China to violate human rights or religious liberties.

The President must control exports to China of any covered technology or intellectual property. Further, the President must sanction (1) a foreign person who sells to China or purchases from China any covered item, and (2) a Chinese person who knowingly uses a covered item provided to them in violation of U.S. export control law.

In addition to a specified list of industries subject to the bill, the USTR must identify certain products from China that either receive designated support from the Chinese government or are used by China to violate human rights or religious liberties.</summary>
