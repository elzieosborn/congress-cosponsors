This bill expands an exception to a provision that bars the admission of certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who unlawfully reenter (or attempt to unlawfully reenter) the United States after being ordered removed.

Currently, the bar to admission does not apply to such a non-U.S. national if the individual (1) last departed from the United States more than 10 years before the attempt to reenter the United States, and (2) has received consent from the Department of Homeland Security to reapply for admission. This bill adds another exception for individuals who last departed from the United States before becoming 11 years old.</summary>
