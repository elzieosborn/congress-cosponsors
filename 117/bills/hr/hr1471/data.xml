This bill temporarily provides credit unions with an exception to limits on outstanding member business loans. Specifically, a loan does not count towards this limit if (1) it is used for recovery from the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency, (2) it is made by an insured credit union that has received a specified soundness rating, (3) it is made during a specified time period, and (4) it does not threaten the safety and soundness of the insured credit union.</summary>
