    "text": "Stop China's Financing of Russia's Invasion Act\n\nThis bill requires additional tariffs on certain Chinese goods if China increases its importation of wheat and barley from Russia.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to certify to the President whether China has increased the volume of wheat and barley imported from Russia relative to the volume imported on February 1, 2022. Upon an affirmative confirmation and until certain requirements are met, the President must impose an additional tariff of 20% on Chinese products that are classified under section I, II, or III of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (which includes, among others, animal and vegetable products).\n\nAdditionally, the bill directs the USTR to take certain actions, including to consider steps to suspend Russia's participation in the World Trade Organization."
