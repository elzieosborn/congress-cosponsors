Currently, such assistance is provided through Medicare Savings Programs, which are administered by state Medicaid programs.\n\n The bill also establishes a related special enrollment period under Medicare, expands eligibility for assistance to beneficiaries with income up to 200% of the federal poverty line, and provides for joint eligibility determinations with respect to the bill's program and the low-income subsidy program under the Medicare prescription drug benefit."
