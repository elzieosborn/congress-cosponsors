  <summary date="2021-11-20T19:51:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Lowering Medicare Premiums and Prescription Drug Costs Act

This bill transfers certain programs that provide Medicare premium and cost-sharing assistance for low-income individuals from Medicaid to Medicare.

Specifically, the bill establishes a program under Medicare to assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries with premiums, coinsurance, deductibles, and other costs. Currently, such assistance is provided through Medicare Savings Programs, which are administered by state Medicaid programs.

 The bill also establishes a related special enrollment period under Medicare, expands eligibility for assistance to beneficiaries with income up to 200% of the federal poverty line, and provides for joint eligibility determinations with respect to the bill's program and the low-income subsidy program under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.</summary>
