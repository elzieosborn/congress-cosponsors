This bill modifies factors the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must consider when awarding grants under the Continuum of Care Program, which provides funding for nonprofit providers and state and local governments&#160;to quickly rehouse homeless individuals&#160;and families.

 Specifically, when awarding Continuum of Care grants, HUD must (1) consider the needs of survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; (2) consider transitional housing projects on an even basis with any other project; and (3) score applicants for grants without prioritizing or deprioritizing rapid-rehousing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, or short-term emergency shelter projects based solely on those project categories.</summary>
