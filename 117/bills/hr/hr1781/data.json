    "text": "Preventing Real Online Threats Endangering Children Today or the PROTECT Kids Act\n\nThis bill addresses the online collection of personal information from children.\n\nSpecifically, the bill raises the age for parental consent protections for children online from under 13 to under 16, adds geolocation and biometric information to protected personal information, and extends all protections for children online to mobile applications.\n\nThe bill also requires the operator of a website, online service, or mobile application to delete a child's personal information upon the verified request of a parent, and it prohibits such operator from terminating service to a child whose parent has refused to permit further collection or use of that child's personal information.\n\nAdditionally, the Federal Trade Commission must study and report on the appropriateness of the existing actual knowledge standard (preventing an operator from collecting personal information without meeting certain requirements when it has actual knowledge that it is collecting such information from a child) and what effects changing such standard will have on children's online privacy."
