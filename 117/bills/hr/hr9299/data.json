The bill also denies a deduction for related expenses, including:\n\n travel; goods or services constituting entertainment, amusement, or recreation; gifts; or other promotion expenses. The Department of the Treasury must enter into a contract with the National Academy of Medicine to develop procedures to evaluate and identify food of poor nutritional quality and brands that are primarily associated with such food.\n\nThe bill authorizes additional funding to carry out the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act."
