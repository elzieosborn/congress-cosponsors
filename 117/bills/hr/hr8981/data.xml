  <summary date="2023-08-15T12:57:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Securing America's Mineral Supply Chains Act of 2022

This bill addresses various matters related to mineral resources and ensuring adequate supply chains for them, with a particular focus on minerals that are critical to the U.S. economy and national security and critical energy resources. For example, the bill

 modifies various requirements related to permitting and other aspects of mining on federal land, including specific modifications related to critical energy resources; restricts mineral withdrawals on federal land and prohibits moratoria on or reversals of certain mineral leases, claims, or permits without congressional approval; establishes programs and requires activities to advance technologies for critical mineral production, carbon mineralization, and recovery of critical minerals from mine waste; provides support for workforce development related to mining; permits the inclusion of certain fuel minerals (e.g., uranium) on a list of minerals that are critical to the U.S. economy and national security; and requires efforts to diversify supply chains and promote domestic sources for critical energy resources.</summary>
