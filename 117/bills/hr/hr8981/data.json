For example, the bill\n\n modifies various requirements related to permitting and other aspects of mining on federal land, including specific modifications related to critical energy resources; restricts mineral withdrawals on federal land and prohibits moratoria on or reversals of certain mineral leases, claims, or permits without congressional approval; establishes programs and requires activities to advance technologies for critical mineral production, carbon mineralization, and recovery of critical minerals from mine waste; provides support for workforce development related to mining; permits the inclusion of certain fuel minerals (e.g., uranium) on a list of minerals that are critical to the U.S. economy and national security; and requires efforts to diversify supply chains and promote domestic sources for critical energy resources."
