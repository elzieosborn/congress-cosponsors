This bill makes it unlawful for a labor organization or its agents while representing, or seeking to represent, employees engaged in maritime employment to engage in a labor slowdown at any time, including when a collective-bargaining agreement is in effect. It also prohibits a labor organization from impeding (1) modernization efforts at a port, or (2) the servicing of any automated vessel.

The bill allows a party injured by such conduct to recover two times the amount of damages sustained and reasonable attorney fees and expert witness fees.</summary>
