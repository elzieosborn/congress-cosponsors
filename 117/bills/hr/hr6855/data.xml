The bill limits the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State from providing technical support or access to DOD/State facilities or assets to U.S. firms producing or funding films. The limitation does not apply if the firm enters into a written agreement with DOD or State not to alter the content of the film in response to, or in anticipation of, a request from China or the Chinese Communist Party. The bill also prohibits U.S. government agencies from providing technical support or access to U.S. firms producing or funding films if the film is co-produced by an entity subject to Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party conditions on content.</summary>
