    "text": "Supporting Education Recognition for Veterans during Emergencies Act or the SERVE Act\n\nThis bill addresses opportunities for certain veterans with medical experience.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to update its web portals to allow the identification of veterans who had a medical occupation as a member of the Armed Forces. Specifically, the bill authorizes veterans to elect to provide their contact information and a history of their medical experience and trained competencies.\n\nThe VA, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Labor must establish a program to share the veteran's provided information with specified entities (e.g., state credentialing bodies) for purposes of facilitating civilian medical credentialing and hiring of veterans seeking to respond to a national emergency, including a public health emergency.\n\nThe VA must implement a program to train and certify veterans who served as basic health care technicians during their service to work as VA intermediate care technicians, specifically at VA medical center locations with staffing shortages. Additionally, the VA must prepare a communications campaign under the Transition Assistance Program to convey opportunities related to the intermediate care technician program to members of the Armed Forces who are separating from active duty.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the VA and DOD to notify veterans service organizations and members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces about the opportunities for veterans provided under this bill."
