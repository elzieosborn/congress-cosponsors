This bill requires the Department of State to revoke passports for certain individuals who fail to make child support payments.

Under current law, if the Department of Health and Human Services certifies that an individual owes more than $2,500 in child support, the Department of State must refuse to issue the individual a passport and may revoke a previously issued passport. Under the bill, State must revoke the previously issued passport.</summary>
