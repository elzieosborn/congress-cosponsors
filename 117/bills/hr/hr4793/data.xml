This bill authorizes sanctions and other prohibitions relating to software that engage in user data theft on behalf of certain foreign countries or entities.

The President may regulate or prohibit transactions using software that engages in the theft or unauthorized transmission of user data and provides access to such data to (1) a communist country, (2) the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), (3) a foreign adversary, or (4) a state sponsor of terrorism.

The President may also impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on developers and owners of software that makes unauthorized transmissions of user data to servers located in China that are accessible by China's government or the CCP.

The Department of State shall report to Congress a determination regarding whether WeChat or TikTok fall within certain regulations and prohibitions, including those provided under this bill. (WeChat and TikTok are software programs developed by China-based companies.)</summary>
