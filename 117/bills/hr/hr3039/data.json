Specified amounts in the trust fund shall be available for the federal Highway Trust Fund, grants to low-income households, and other specified energy, environmental, infrastructure, and research and development priorities.\n\nThe bill also\n\n eliminates the federal motor vehicle and aviation fuel taxes, modifies the tax credit for carbon capture and storage and the qualifying advanced coal project tax credit, imposes a moratorium on finalizing and enforcing certain Clean Air Act regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and establishes a National Climate Commission to review policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The moratorium on regulations for limiting greenhouse gas emissions expires in 2035 if specified emission targets are not reached."
