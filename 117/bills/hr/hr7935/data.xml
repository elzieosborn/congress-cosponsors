This bill provides assistance to eligible companies relocating manufacturing from China to a qualifying Latin American or Caribbean country, generally a country in the region that has a free trade agreement with the United States and is not a foreign adversary.

For example, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation must use at least 10 percent of its funding for each fiscal year to provide assistance, such as financing eligible costs for moving and workforce development, to businesses relocating manufacturing from China to a qualifying Latin American or Caribbean country, subject to various conditions and requirements.

The bill also provides tax benefits related to certain property acquired and placed in service in connection with such a relocation of manufacturing.</summary>
