  <summary date="2021-06-10T12:34:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Broadband Speed Act

This bill establishes a reporting requirement for all broadband internet service providers and a capacity requirement for providers that&#160;use federal funds to construct new broadband infrastructure.

Specifically, the bill requires an internet service provider to report the actual speed of the broadband it provides consumers, and it establishes a fine for any provider that has willfully or knowingly provided false data about the speed it is capable of offering. Additionally, the bill requires any new broadband infrastructure built using funds awarded under federal universal service support programs to provide service of at least 100 megabits per second.</summary>
