This bill expands the notification requirement for plant closures and mass layoffs under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act to include notices to Members of Congress.

The bill provides that an employer's notice of a plant closing or mass layoff shall not be considered valid unless the employer, prior to serving such notice, covers the cost of an economic impact study to assess the economic impact of such an order. An employer who is not experiencing economic hardship and who orders a plant closing or mass layoff must make payments to the Impacted Workers Fund, created by this bill, to cover the financial losses of states resulting from such an order.</summary>
