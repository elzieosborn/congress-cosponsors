  <summary date="2023-01-20T14:51:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Websites and Software Applications Accessibility Act

This bill requires employers, public entities, and public accommodations that provide goods or services through a website or online application to make those websites and applications accessible to individuals with disabilities. The requirement applies even if the good or service is offered only digitally. The Department of Justice (DOJ) must issue standards of accessibility for applicable entities to meet this requirement. The bill provides for enforcement by DOJ, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and individual civil action. It also establishes various review and reporting requirements.</summary>
