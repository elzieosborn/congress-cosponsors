  <summary date="2022-07-15T19:07:44Z" status="Reported to House, Part I">Improving Language Access in Mortgage Servicing Act of 2021 

This bill establishes language translation requirements related to residential mortgage applications and servicing.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) must create a standard language preference form. Creditors and servicers must provide this form to consumers along with residential mortgage applications and certain notices related to a mortgage loan.

Upon notice of a consumer's language preference, creditors and servicers must provide (1) oral interpretation services; and (2) translated documents, if available.

The CFPB and the Federal Housing Finance Agency must publish translated documents used in association with a residential mortgage.</summary>
