This bill establishes a sovereign lending program for eligible Latin American and Caribbean partner countries to support such countries' short-term energy needs and fund projects to transition to renewable or clean energy that reduces carbon emissions.

The bill also directs the Department of State to prioritize and expedite U.S. government support for such countries' efforts to increase energy security, including by providing support for projects that improve Latin American and Caribbean energy markets.</summary>
