Such strategy shall encompass how to (1) ensure compliance by China with the financial terms and conditions of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits, and (2) eliminate subsidized export financing programs and other forms of export subsidies.\n\nAdditionally, the bill shifts certain requirements for negotiations related to ending export credit financing that currently lay with the President to Treasury."
