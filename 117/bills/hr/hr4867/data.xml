This bill directs the chief information officer (CIO) of each federal agency to take specified steps with respect to the management of data centers.

Specifically, each CIO shall (1) develop and publish a strategic plan to consolidate and optimize data centers at the agency, and (2) update the plan not later than two years after the plan was published.

Each agency, in coordination with the Office of the Archivist of the United States, shall create copies of all records controlled by the agency and transfer such copies to a records center maintained and operated by such office.

By three months after this bill's enactment, such office shall (1) develop standards for each agency to create copies of the records, (2) develop guidelines for each agency to store metadata with respect to such records and transfer such copies, and (3) make exemptions to the standards developed.

The bill requires each agency to designate a senior official to manage records and lists such official's duties.</summary>
