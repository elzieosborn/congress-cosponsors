Further, the bill repeals the President's authority to withdraw unleased lands on the outer Continental Shelf from oil and gas leasing.\n\nThe bill nullifies\n\n Executive Order 13990 titled Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis; Executive Order 14008 titled Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad; and the Department of the Interior's Secretarial Order 3395 concerning a temporary suspension of delegated authority to all of Interior's Bureaus and Offices, including the authority to approve leases."
