This bill designates specified segments of the Housatonic River in Connecticut as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

The designation of the river segments must not impact or alter the existing terms of permitting, licensing, or operation of

 the Falls Village Hydroelectric Generating Station located in Falls Village, Connecticut, or the Bulls Bridge Hydroelectric Generating Station located in New Milford, Connecticut. The designation of the river segments must also not preclude the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from licensing, relicensing, or otherwise authorizing the operation or continued operation of those facilities.

The authority of the Department of the Interior to acquire lands for the river segments shall be

 limited to acquisition by donation or acquisition with the consent of the owner, and subject to the additional criteria set forth in the Housatonic River Management Plan. No land or interest in land may be acquired for the river segments by condemnation.</summary>
