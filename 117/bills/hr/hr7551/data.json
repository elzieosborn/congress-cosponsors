The designation of the river segments must also not preclude the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from licensing, relicensing, or otherwise authorizing the operation or continued operation of those facilities.\n\nThe authority of the Department of the Interior to acquire lands for the river segments shall be\n\n limited to acquisition by donation or acquisition with the consent of the owner, and subject to the additional criteria set forth in the Housatonic River Management Plan. No land or interest in land may be acquired for the river segments by condemnation."
