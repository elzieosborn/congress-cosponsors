This bill establishes rights for individuals who are subject to legal guardianship or conservatorship.

Specifically, these individuals have the right to

 petition the court to replace their private legal guardian or conservator with a state guardian or other designated individual; and communicate with a caseworker employed by the state, without the interference or objection of the individual's legal guardian or conservator. Furthermore, the bill creates a private right of action for individuals whose rights have been violated.

The bill also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to provide grants to states to hire state-employed caseworkers, legal guardians, and conservators for legally incompetent adults.</summary>
