    "text": "We Will Not Comply Act\n\nThis bill prohibits discrimination based on an individual's COVID-19 vaccination status.\n\nSpecifically, the bill bars certain commercial businesses from discriminating on the basis of an individual's COVID-19 vaccination status.\n\nIn addition, the bill generally prohibits using federal funds to establish or enforce COVID-19 vaccination requirements. Further, federal funds may not be used to compel an individual with a religious objection to vaccinations to receive a vaccine.\n\nThe bill also prohibits federal funding of educational institutions that require an individual to receive a COVID-19 vaccine to participate in academic or extracurricular activities. Additionally, a public school or public college may not deny access to the school or college based on whether an individual has received a vaccine, including the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nFurthermore, air carriers may not deny an individual access to air transportation solely on the basis of COVID-19 vaccination status. The bill also prohibits proof of a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of receiving a U.S. passport.\n\nThe bill establishes a private right of action for individuals who have been discriminated against based on COVID-19 vaccine status or failure to comply with a requirement to wear a face covering."
