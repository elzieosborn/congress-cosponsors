  <summary date="2021-10-19T21:24:53Z" status="Introduced in House">We Will Not Comply Act

This bill prohibits discrimination based on an individual's COVID-19 vaccination status.

Specifically, the bill bars certain commercial businesses from discriminating on the basis of an individual's COVID-19 vaccination status.

In addition, the bill generally prohibits using federal funds to establish or enforce COVID-19 vaccination requirements. Further, federal funds may not be used to compel an individual with a religious objection to vaccinations to receive a vaccine.

The bill also prohibits federal funding of educational institutions that require an individual to receive a COVID-19 vaccine to participate in academic or extracurricular activities. Additionally, a public school or public college may not deny access to the school or college based on whether an individual has received a vaccine, including the COVID-19 vaccine.

Furthermore, air carriers may not deny an individual access to air transportation solely on the basis of COVID-19 vaccination status. The bill also prohibits proof of a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of receiving a U.S. passport.

The bill establishes a private right of action for individuals who have been discriminated against based on COVID-19 vaccine status or failure to comply with a requirement to wear a face covering.</summary>
