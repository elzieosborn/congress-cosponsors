(India and South Africa previously submitted a petition to suspend all intellectual property rights associated with COVID-19 innovations, such as vaccines.)\n\nBased on this report, the U.S. Trade Representative must oppose such elimination or waiver with respect to COVID-19 vaccines if HHS determines that the elimination or waiver will not materially increase global vaccine access or that it will have a negative impact on specified factors relating to access to, manufacture of, and investment in COVID-19 vaccines."
