Such actions may take effect without congressional approval for one 90-day period if the President\n\n determines that it is necessary because of a national emergency, because of an imminent threat to health or safety, for the enforcement of criminal laws, or for national security; and submits written notice of the determination to Congress. The U.S. International Trade Commission must report on the effects on the U.S. economy of any unilateral trade action taken pursuant to this bill."
