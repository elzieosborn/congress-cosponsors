This bill adjusts requirements related to utilizing Department of Veterans Affairs educational assistance for flight training purposes, including by removing the requirement that an individual must possess a valid private pilot certificate and meet certain medical requirements to utilize such assistance.

Individuals enrolled in a program of education at an institution of higher learning in which flight training is required may elect to receive accelerated payments of tuition and fees if they also elect to receive educational counseling. The bill also specifies the calculation and determination of such fees, as well as the calculation of available entitlement in cases of accelerated payments.</summary>
