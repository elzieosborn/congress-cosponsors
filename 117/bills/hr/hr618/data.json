This requirement begins 5 days after enactment of this bill and ends 60 days after the end of the period of time a borrower may request a COVID-19 related forbearance.\n\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency may not increase fees or otherwise restrict access to credit during the COVID-19 emergency without congressional notice.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on COVID-19-related assistance to consumers by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance programs."
