  <summary date="2022-08-02T21:16:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 2021

This bill modifies the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA).

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Defense to report on the goals and incentives used to increase awards of SBIR and STTR contracts. It also prioritizes innovation in manufacturing and cybersecurity and directs federal agencies to issue Phase III awards to technology developers without requiring further competition.

Further, the bill makes permanent (as the Civilian Agency Commercialization Readiness Program) the pilot program that a covered agency may establish for awarding SBIR and STTR Phase II and III funds for technology development and progression toward commercialization. The bill also extends the Commercialization Assistance Pilot Program though FY2026.

The bill authorizes specified agencies to use a percentage of STTR funds for a Proof of Concept Partnership program to accelerate the creation of small businesses and the commercialization of research innovations. It also authorizes all agencies participating in the SBIR program, during FY2022-FY2026, to provide a SBIR Phase II award for a project to a small business concern without regard to whether such concern was provided a Phase I award for such project.

The bill requires the SBA to conduct outreach efforts at minority institutions and Hispanic-serving institutions.</summary>
