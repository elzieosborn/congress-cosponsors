This bill provides localities injured by the cancellation or relocation of certain sporting events a remedy for such action.

Specifically, the bill makes it unlawful for Major League Baseball to cancel or relocate a competition that is not a part of the regular season unless it is a reasonable response to a pandemic, natural disaster, inclement weather, or emergency declared by the federal government or by the state in which the game is scheduled to occur. A locality that is injured by a violation may commence a civil action for damages from the league for canceling or relocating the game.</summary>
