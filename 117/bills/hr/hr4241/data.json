PFAS are man-made and may have adverse human health effects.\n\nNot later than 60 days following the detection of PFAS at a military installation, formerly used defense site, or state-owned facility of the National Guard, DOD must take removal actions to ensure that all individuals served by a drinking water source contaminated by PFAS have access to drinking water that meets the applicable standard, regardless of whether DOD is the drinking water purveyor. Additionally, DOD must complete all physical construction required for the remediation of PFAS at such sites not later than 10 years after the enactment of this bill.\n\nDOD must report to Congress identifying the status of remediation efforts at 50 specified sites, such as England Air Force Base, Louisiana. DOD must complete all physical construction required for the remediation of PFAS at the 50 specified sites not later than five years after the enactment of this bill."
