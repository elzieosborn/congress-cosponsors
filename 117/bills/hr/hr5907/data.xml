  <summary date="2023-08-28T18:03:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Water Infrastructure for Rural and Impoverished Communities Act

This bill makes rural communities with up to 30,000 residents eligible to apply, under certain conditions, for grants and loans for water and waste disposal infrastructure. (Current law limits eligibility to communities with 10,000 or fewer residents.)

 In making the grants and loans, the Department of Agriculture must prioritize communities in counties where at least 20% of the population has persistently lived in poverty.</summary>
