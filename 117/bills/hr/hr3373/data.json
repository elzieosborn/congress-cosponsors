Furthermore, the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security must carry out a program to support regional maritime security partnerships.\n\nIn addition, the President must impose sanctions on foreign individuals and entities that engage in corruption in Oceania.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs must commence a demonstration program to provide medical and extended care services to U.S. veterans residing in the freely associated states (i.e., Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Micronesia).\n\nThe U.S. International Development Finance Corporation must establish a strategy for using market-based private investment to support the development goals of Oceania countries.\n\nThe bill also requires reports on topics related to Oceania, including (1) a strategy to expand the presence of the Peace Corps, (2) the use of technology to address illegal fishing, and (3) the Department of the Treasury's financial intelligence resources."
