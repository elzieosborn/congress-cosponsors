This bill requires the Office of the Administration for Children &amp; Families to evaluate the protocols that states have developed to comply with the reporting requirements for locating a child missing from foster care.

Additionally, the administration, through the Children's Bureau, must provide states, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and tribal consortia with information, advice, educational materials, and technical assistance relating to eliminating identified obstacles to identifying and responding to children missing from foster care and other vulnerable foster youth and providing such children and youth with effective services.</summary>
