This bill provides continuing FY2023 appropriations to federal agencies through February 3, 2023.

It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2023 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires on December 16, 2022.

The bill also extends several expiring programs and authorities, including several health programs.</summary>
