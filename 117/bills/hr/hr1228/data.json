These sanctions shall expire on December 31, 2026.\n\nFurther, the President is authorized to expand educational and cultural exchange programs with Libya.\n\nThe bill urges the U.S. Agency for International Development to provide humanitarian assistance to individuals and communities in Libya, including health assistance, food, shelter, and support for an effective COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) response.\n\nThe Department of State must work to strengthen Libya's democratic governance, including by\u00a0providing assistance to (1) unify Libya's financial and governing institutions, and (2) ensure free and credible future elections in Libya.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must vote and argue for international financial institutions to support an economic recovery in Libya that\u00a0complements the establishment of democratic institutions and rule of law."
