It must also (1) create a database containing data and information on such objects, (2) utilize existing tools and methods to determine the likelihood and circumstances under which such objects may reenter the Earth's atmosphere, (3) assess the risk such objects may pose to aircraft or individuals and property on the ground, and (4) establish a system to control or restrict airspace when risks are present due to the presence or expected presence of airborne debris and to expeditiously notify and redirect aircraft at risk of being impacted by such debris."
