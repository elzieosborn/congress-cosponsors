  <summary date="2021-08-02T15:57:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Head Start Improvement Act

This bill replaces the existing Head Start program with block grants to states and Indian tribes for prekindergarten (pre-K) education.

Instead of providing direct financial assistance to Head Start agencies, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall allot block grant funds for pre-K education among eligible states and tribes in accordance with&#160;their relative proportions of children, age three, four, or five, from low-income households.&#160;Grant recipients&#160;shall use the grant funds to (1)&#160;award subgrants to eligible entities&#160;that provide&#160;pre-K education programs; (2) administer such programs; and (3) provide technical assistance, oversight, monitoring, research, and training.

Under current law, HHS is authorized to designate, monitor, and establish standards for&#160;Head Start agencies. The bill instead shifts&#160;pre-K program oversight and control&#160;to states and tribes.

In addition, to the extent permitted under state law, grant recipients may use grant funds to establish (1) portable voucher systems that allow costs to be paid&#160;for attendance at&#160;private pre-K education programs; and (2) an education savings account that allows a parent of a low-income child to use a portion of the grant funds, or other available public or private funds added to the account, for expenses related to pre-K education.

Under current law, federal financial assistance for a Head Start program&#160;is generally limited to&#160;80% of total program costs. The bill maintains this&#160;limitation by&#160;requiring grant recipients to provide matching funds equal to 20% of the grant amount.</summary>
