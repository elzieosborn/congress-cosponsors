This bill establishes the Commission on the Advancement of Social Enterprise to examine and make recommendations on ways the federal government can support and utilize social enterprises (i.e., businesses created to further a social purpose in a financially sustainable way).

The commission must (1) establish criteria for identifying social enterprises, which may include nonprofit and for-profit organizations, for purposes of federal programs; and (2) identify opportunities for the federal government to engage social enterprises in creating jobs and strengthening local economies.

The areas studied and potential recommendations offered shall include, among other things

 the role of social enterprises in addressing economic, social, and environmental policy challenges across all levels of government; corporate legal structures that foster or impede the development of social enterprises; how to encourage impact investing; and barriers to social enterprise growth. The commission shall (1) report to the President and Congress within one year after it establishes criteria by which to identify social enterprise, and (2) terminate 90 days after it submits its report.</summary>
