    "text": "American Workforce Recovery Act\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Labor to provide funding to states and local areas to expand their employment training programs for employed and unemployed individuals, displaced workers, and to meet particular employment needs of employers.\n\nSpecifically, the bill gives states funding to broaden training options such as remote or virtual for employees and employers by eligible providers of training services.\n\nThe bill also grants funds to local areas to establish a Pandemic Reskilling Fund for dislocated workers participating in specified training services and career services for adults and dislocated workers.\n\nLocal areas may also establish individual training accounts to support on-the-job training and supportive services.\n\nThese individual training accounts must pay for training provided by eligible entities. Any remaining funds in an individual's account may be paid in cash to the individual if such individual obtains full-time, unsubsidized employment within six weeks after completion of the training and has been so employed for six weeks. An individual who fails to meet these requirements must return such funds to the local government for redistribution.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report to Congress on (1) the flexibility provided through the individual training accounts; and (2) the overall effectiveness of the funds provided under this bill to promote the skill acquisition, employment, and retention of the individuals who were assisted with such funds, including individuals with barriers to employment."
