In implementing such fertility controls, the Bureau of Land Management shall prioritize the recruitment of military veterans to train and become certified in the application of fertility controls, including the certified PZP applicator certification offered by the Science and Conservation Center's Certification Program.\n\nInterior shall provide appropriate compensation to military veterans participating in such a certification program.\n\nThe bill authorizes Interior to contract with military veterans who have completed the training program to carry out fertility control activities."
