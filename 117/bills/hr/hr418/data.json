    "text": "Article I Restoration Act of 2021\n\nThis bill requires any covered rule issued by an executive agency after\u00a0this bill's enactment to sunset three years after its effective date unless specifically reauthorized by Congress.\n\nA covered rule does not include a rule\n\n issued in accordance with specified formal rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act; issued with respect to a military or foreign affairs function of the United States; that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs certifies is necessary for the enforcement of federal criminal laws; that is limited to agency organization, management, or personnel matters; or that is necessary due to an imminent threat to human health or safety or any other emergency. An agency may not reissue, enforce, revise, or take other regulatory action related to a covered rule that has sunset.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget or the relevant agency may oversee the sunset of covered rules.\n\nIf the agency that issues covered rules wants to request a reauthorization for such rules, such agency shall, by the December 1 that is one year before the rule is scheduled to sunset, submit to Congress a report that includes (1) a justification for such reauthorization, (2) any related covered rules, and (3) any recommendation or request made by the chair or ranking member of an appropriate committee."
