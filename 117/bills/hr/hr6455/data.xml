This bill requires actions to promote trade, investment, and strategic partnerships between the United States and countries in Africa.

The President must establish the Prosper Africa Initiative to prioritize and coordinate U.S. government activities and diplomatic efforts aimed at increasing two-way trade and investment between the United States and Africa. The President must also establish (1) the Prosper Africa Directorate to perform various functions to support the initiative, including by developing and implementing policies to promote such trade and investment; (2) an interagency leadership committee to provide strategic guidance to the initiative and coordinate federal agency efforts; and (3) an advisory council to advise the President on the extent to which the directorate and federal agencies are meeting the objectives established in this bill.

Designated staff in U.S. embassies located in Africa shall also support the initiative to the extent practicable.

The President must seek to convene a meeting every two years between the U.S. government and the heads of state of African countries to advance shared priorities and strengthen partnerships.

The bill also requires the President to (1) report to Congress and make publicly available a government-wide strategy to achieve this bill's objectives, and (2) annually report to Congress on matters related to U.S. government efforts to achieve this bill's objectives.</summary>
