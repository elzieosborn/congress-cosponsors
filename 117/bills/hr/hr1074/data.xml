  <summary date="2022-01-06T17:08:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Reducing Antiquated Permitting for Infrastructure Deployment Act or the RAPID Act

This bill modifies review requirements for deployment of a small personal wireless service facility and establishes a presumption related to the deployment of wireless facilities on properties owned by an Indian tribe or a Native Hawaiian organization.

Specifically, the bill exempts the deployment of a small personal wireless service facility from specified environmental and historic preservation review requirements.

The bill also establishes a rebuttable presumption that a wireless provider has completed a request for review if an Indian tribe or a Native Hawaiian organization has received certain completed forms with information reasonably necessary to ascertain whether historic properties of religious and cultural significance may be affected by the deployment of new or collocated wireless facilities.</summary>
