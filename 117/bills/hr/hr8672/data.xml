  <summary date="2023-01-09T19:12:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2022 

This bill establishes a process to vacate convictions and expunge arrest records for certain criminal offenses committed by victims of human trafficking that directly result from or relate to having been a trafficking victim.

It defines the offenses eligible to be vacated or expunged and sets forth procedures for filing a motion.

The bill directs the Government Accountability Office to assess the impact of this process, including the number of human trafficking survivors who file motions to vacate convictions or expunge records.

The bill permits certain grants for legal representation to be used to seek post-conviction relief.

Finally, the bill establishes a rebuttable presumption that certain offenses were induced by duress if the defendant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that he or she was a victim of human trafficking at the time of the offense.</summary>
