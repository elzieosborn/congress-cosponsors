  <summary date="2021-10-29T18:11:37Z" status="Introduced in House">ESP Family Leave Act

This bill allows education support professionals to meet the hours of service requirements for family and medical leave if they have worked a number of hours equal to not less than 60% of the total monthly hours expected for their job descriptions and duties, as assigned for the previous school year.

Education support professionals are employees within a public school or public institution of higher education which may include specified staff, such as paraeducators, administrative support staff, custodians, skilled trade workers, and nursing support staff.

The Department of Labor may provide a method for calculating such leave for these professionals.</summary>
