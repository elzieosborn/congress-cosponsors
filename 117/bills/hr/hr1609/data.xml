This bill allows for Medicare payment of ground ambulance services that did not result in the actual transport of an individual to a permitted facility, if the lack of transport was due to community-wide COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) protocols for emergency medical services during the public health emergency.</summary>
