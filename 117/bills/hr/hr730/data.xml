  <summary date="2022-05-04T21:37:29Z" status="Reported to House, Part I">Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act of 2021

 This bill authorizes private civil causes of action for disparate impact violations (to the same extent as intentional violations) of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities.

Education programs that receive financial assistance authorized or extended by the Department of Education (ED) must designate at least one Title VI compliance coordinator to carry out responsibilities, investigate complaints, and provide assistance to ensure students and employees are aware of their rights and responsibilities.

The bill requires ED to appoint a Special Assistant for Equity and Inclusion to (1) promote, coordinate, and evaluate efforts to engender program compliance and inform individuals of their rights; and (2) advise ED on matters relating to compliance.</summary>
