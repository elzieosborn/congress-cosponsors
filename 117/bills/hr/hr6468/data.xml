  <summary date="2022-04-01T20:13:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Domestic Security Using Production Partnerships and Lessons from Yesterday Act of 2022 or the Domestic SUPPLY Act of 2022

This bill establishes a program and sets out other requirements to promote domestic manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPE) for infectious diseases and other public health emergencies.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must establish a program to enter into purchasing agreements for PPE produced domestically by manufacturers that are majority-owned and -operated by U.S. citizens. HHS must coordinate with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security on this program.

In addition, the federal government must only procure, subject to limited exceptions, PPE that is produced domestically to prevent the transmission of an infectious disease. If using federal funds, states or localities must also procure PPE domestically.

Further, the bill requires HHS to consult with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on a report about changes to federal requirements for PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of those changes on health care workers who cared for patients in 2020 and 2021.</summary>
