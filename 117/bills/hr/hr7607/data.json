Personality traits refer to the patterns of an individual with respect to behaviors, thoughts, and emotions and may include patterns relating to humor, sensitivity, grit, leadership, integrity, helpfulness, courage, and kindness.\n\nSpecifically, the IHE must make available on its public website and application materials (1) a statement informing applicants of the use of personality traits in making admission determinations, (2) the rationale for such use of personality traits, (3) a description of the process under which personality traits are considered, and (4) the standards and criteria used for rating personality traits."
