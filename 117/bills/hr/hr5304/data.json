    "text": "Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act \n\nThis bill provides continuing FY2022 appropriations for federal agencies, suspends the debt limit, provides supplemental appropriations, and extends several expiring programs and authorities.\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides continuing FY2022 appropriations to federal agencies through the earlier of December 3, 2021, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act.\n\nIt is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2022 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2022 begins on October 1, 2021. The CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2021 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.\n\nIn addition, the bill provides supplemental appropriations to several federal agencies for activities related to natural disasters and the evacuees from Afghanistan.\n\nThe bill suspends the public debt limit through December 16, 2022. On December 17, 2022, the limit will be increased to accommodate obligations issued during the suspension period.\n\nThe bill also extends several expiring programs and authorities, including\n\n the National Flood Insurance Program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, the temporary scheduling order issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration to place fentanyl-related substances in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, and the authority for the Department of Agriculture to waive certain requirements for the school meal programs."
