This bill establishes requirements for Members of Congress related to consideration of appropriations bills, lobbying activities, and retirement benefits.

Specifically, the bill prohibits (1) the House of Representatives from adjourning for more than three calendar days in August until it has approved annual appropriations bills for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of that year, and (2) Congress from adjourning for more than three calendar days between October 1 and the end of the congressional session until the annual appropriations bills are presented to the President.

Neither chamber may recess or stand adjourned longer than 24 hours during any calendar year until Congress has agreed to a budget resolution for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of such year that projects a balanced budget by the last fiscal year covered by the resolution.

The bill establishes a five-year ban on (1) individuals appointed to executive schedule positions from engaging in lobbying activities in the executive branch, and (2) lobbying activities by Members of Congress.

 The Office of Government Ethics may waive lobbying restrictions for certain employees if it determines that the restrictions would create an undue hardship in obtaining qualified personnel for agency positions and granting such waiver would not create the potential for undue influence or unfair advantage.

The bill excludes future Members of Congress from the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and requires Members currently enrolled in FERS to opt in to continue their enrollment.</summary>
