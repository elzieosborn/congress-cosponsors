    "text": "Protecting American Resources, Innovation, and Sovereignty Act or the PARIS Act\n\nThis bill requires the President to submit a report to Congress prior to taking certain actions under the Paris Agreement, and it gives Congress the authority to block such actions. The bill also prohibits any legal cause of action in U.S. courts pursuant to the Paris Agreement.\n\nPrior to establishing or revising a climate change-related action (referred to under the agreement as a nationally determined contribution or NDC), the President must submit a detailed report to Congress that includes information such as how the NDC will impact the level of total global emissions. If any action proposed in this report results in increased costs of energy or manufacturing, the report must include specific policy measures to prevent (1) job displacement, (2) reduced global competitiveness of U.S. goods, and (3) leaked emissions that may occur as a result of the proposed action. Congress may block the NDC by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval within 60 days of the President submitting this report."
