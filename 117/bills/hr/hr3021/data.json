To be exempt from liability, professionals and entities must provide these services in good faith, even if a service is outside a professional's normal area of practice, or withhold these services for reasons related to the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nHowever, this exemption does not apply (1) if the act or omission constitutes willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed; or (2) if the professional provides the services while under the influence of alcohol or certain drugs."
