The modification extends through FY2030.\n\nBefore apportioning grant funds for any urbanized area that is no longer an eligible area due to a change in population, the Department of Transportation must apportion to such area, for three fiscal years, an amount equal to half of the funds the area received in the previous fiscal year."
