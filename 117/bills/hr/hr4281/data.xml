  <summary date="2022-01-07T16:33:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Tibet Independence Act

This bill addresses and imposes sanctions relating to Tibet.

The bill states that it is U.S. policy to affirm that China's territorial claims over Tibet are invalid and without merit. It also authorizes the President to recognize Tibet as a separate and independent country.

 The President must impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign persons that are knowingly responsible for or complicit in supporting the Chinese Communist Party's occupation of Tibet.</summary>
