This bill prohibits institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student-aid programs from using political tests in the selection, hiring, or promotion of students, employees, or faculty.

Political test refers to a method of compelling or soliciting an applicant for enrollment or employment, student, or employee of an IHE to identify commitment to or make a statement of personal belief in support of any ideology or movement that (1) promotes a specific partisan or political set of beliefs, (2) promotes a particular viewpoint on an issue of public controversy, or (3) promotes the disparate treatment of any individual or group of individuals on the basis of race or ethnicity.</summary>
