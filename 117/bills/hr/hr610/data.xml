  <summary date="2021-07-28T19:02:50Z" status="Passed House">San Francisco Bay Restoration Act

This bill provides support for the protection and restoration of the San Francisco Bay estuary and the&#160;recovery&#160;of certain species in the estuary.

Specifically, it establishes a San Francisco Bay Program Office in the Environmental Protection Agency.

The program must annually compile a list of funding priorities for projects or studies that advance the goals and objectives of the comprehensive conservation and management plan approved&#160;under the National Estuary Program for the San Francisco Bay estuary. The list must include projects or studies for

 water quality improvement; wetland, riverine, and estuary restoration and protection; nearshore and endangered species recovery; and adaptation to climate change. The program must review such plan at least once every five years and revise the plan as appropriate.

The program may&#160;provide funding through grants or other means for studies or projects on the priority list.</summary>
