  <summary date="2021-12-22T21:48:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Roadmap to Congressional Reform Act

This bill makes several modifications to congressional benefits and legislative procedures.

For example, the bill withholds the salaries of Members of a chamber that has not agreed to a budget resolution, and establishes a point of order in the House of Representatives against considering legislation that contains a congressional earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit.

The bill prohibits a recess or adjournment if Congress has not adopted a concurrent resolution on the budget or passed the regular appropriations bills for the next fiscal year by specified dates. A Member may not use any amount for official travel while this prohibition applies.

The bill also allows future Members of the House of Representatives to opt out of the Federal Employees Retirement System, and it permits Members of Congress who opt out to continue to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan.

Additionally, the bill requires a measure introduced in either chamber to cite the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution to enact the measure. Further, a measure must include the text of the current law being amended and show the modifications to that law.

The bill withholds one day's pay from a Representative's compensation for each day the Representative uses a designated proxy to cast a vote or record their presence.

Lastly, the bill imposes a permanent ban on lobbying contacts by a former Member of Congress or a former elected officer of the House or Senate.</summary>
