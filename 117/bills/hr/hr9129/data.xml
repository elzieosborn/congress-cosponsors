This bill establishes an Office of Global Competition Analysis.

The purposes of the office are to

 carry out a program of analysis on U.S. leadership in technology and innovation sectors critical to national security and economic prosperity relative to other countries, particularly those countries that are strategic competitors of the United States; and support policy development and decision-making to ensure U.S. leadership in technology and innovation sectors critical to national security and economic prosperity. To carry out the purposes, the office may enter into an agreement with a public-private or a federally funded research and development center, a university affiliated research center, or consortium of such centers.

Periodically, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Economic Council, and the National Security Council, in coordination with other executive agencies, shall jointly determine the analytical priorities of the office.</summary>
