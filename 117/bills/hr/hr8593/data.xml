This bill requires implementation of a plan for federal agencies to collect and publish statistics regarding the U.S. territories in the same manner as statistics are collected and reported for the states.

Specifically, the bill directs the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy to publish a list and assessment of existing federal statistical programs that collect and publish data for the U.S. territories comparable to the states.

The council must submit to Congress a plan to collect and publish statistics regarding the territories in the same manner as statistics are collected and reported by federal agencies for the states.

The council, in coordination with agencies, must implement the plan no later than four years after enactment of this bill.</summary>
