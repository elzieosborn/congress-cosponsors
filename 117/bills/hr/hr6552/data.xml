  <summary date="2022-10-05T19:25:48Z" status="Passed House">Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022

This bill reauthorizes programs to combat human trafficking and addresses related issues.

The bill reauthorizes through FY2026 various programs, including (1) Department of State and Department of Justice activities to combat human trafficking internationally; and (2) the Angel Watch Center, a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement program that notifies foreign countries of the pending arrival of certain convicted sex offenders.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may carry out a program to prevent the re-exploitation of certain victims of trafficking by helping such individuals reintegrate into society and achieve self-sufficiency.

The bill modifies an existing HHS grant program to provide training to school staff and students to recognize and avoid human trafficking, including by (1) renaming the program the Frederick Douglass Human Trafficking Prevention Education Grants program, and (2) modifying the prioritization for awarding such grants.

The U.S. Agency for International Development must encourage integration of activities to counter human trafficking into its broader assistance programs.

The bill also reauthorizes the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking through FY2031.</summary>
