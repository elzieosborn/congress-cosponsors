No federal funds may be used for the proposed settling, housing, or transporting if (1) the state governor's office does not approve of the action, or (2) the political subdivision in question has a law or resolution prohibiting or disapproving of such an action.\n\nThese requirements shall not apply to the use of federal funds to transport or detain such an individual for civil or criminal law enforcement purposes."
