  <summary date="2023-08-24T21:48:43Z" status="Introduced in House">Carbon Removal and Emissions Storage Technologies Act of 2022 or the CREST Act of 2022

This bill expands the current research and development programs of the Department of Energy (DOE) for capturing and storing carbon dioxide to include methods that harness natural processes, such as the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and its storage in geological, biobased, or ocean reservoirs. In addition, the bill establishes a five-year pilot program under which DOE must purchase from certain facilities carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere or upper hydrosphere.</summary>
