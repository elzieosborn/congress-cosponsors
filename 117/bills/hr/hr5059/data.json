    "text": "Make It in America Act\n\nThis bill addresses domestic content requirements and narrows instances in which waivers may be granted.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs the Office for Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to promulgate regulations to standardize and simplify how federal agencies comply with, report on, and enforce the Buy American Act, including guidelines to ensure that a project is not disaggregated for purposes of avoiding the applicability of such requirements.\n\nBefore granting a waiver in the public interest with respect to a product sourced from a foreign country, a federal agency shall assess whether a significant portion of the cost advantage of the product is the result of the use of dumped steel, iron, or manufactured goods or the use of injuriously subsidized steel, iron, or manufactured goods.\n\nThe OMB shall establish within it a Made in America Office to maximize and enforce compliance with domestic preference statutes, develop and implement procedures to review waiver requests, ensure that contracting personnel, financial assistance personnel, and nonfederal recipients are regularly trained on obligations under such statutes, and ensure the development of a domestic supply base to meet federal procurement requirements.\n\nThe bill directs the Department of Transportation to enter into a technical assistance partnership with the Department of Commerce to ensure the development of a domestic supply base to support intermodal transportation and to ensure compliance with domestic preference statutes."
