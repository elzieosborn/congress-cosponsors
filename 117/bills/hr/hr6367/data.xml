  <summary date="2022-03-01T11:20:46Z" status="Introduced in House">Guaranteeing Ukrainian Autonomy by Reinforcing its Defense (GUARD) Act of 2022 

This bill provides support for Ukraine and imposes sanctions related to Nord Stream 2, the pipeline constructed to increase exports of natural gas from Russia.

The Department of State must periodically report to Congress a determination as to whether Russia's government meets the criteria to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism.

The bill authorizes the State Department to provide Foreign Military Financing assistance to Ukraine in FY2022. The bill also authorizes providing Ukraine with lethal assistance, such as anti-armor weapon systems and anti-aircraft weapons systems.

From FY2022-FY2026, Ukraine shall have priority access to excess defense articles.

During the same time period, the bill also authorizes providing Ukraine with assistance, including (1) International Military Education and Training assistance; (2) assistance to strengthen cybersecurity and intellectual property enforcement; (3) support and training for banking reform, subsidy reform, corporate governance, and the privatization of state-owned enterprises; and (4) assistance to combat corruption and improve the rule of law.

Within 15 days of this bill's enactment, the President must impose sanctions on any entity responsible for planning, constructing, or operating Nord Stream 2, as well as any corporate officer of such an entity. The bill also subjects the President's authority to waive certain sanctions to congressional review.

The U.S. Agency for Global Media may expand broadcasting in countries of the former Soviet Union to combat Russian disinformation.

The bill requires reports to Congress on various topics, including a strategy on using U.S. diplomacy to support Ukraine.</summary>
