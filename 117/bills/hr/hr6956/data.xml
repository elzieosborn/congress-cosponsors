This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to carry out two programs to support student participation in local government and volunteer service.

Specifically, ED must make allocations for states to (1) support paid internships within local government agencies for secondary school students, and (2) award competitive scholarships to eligible students who demonstrate a commitment to volunteer service work conducted for or on behalf of a government or nonprofit organization.</summary>
