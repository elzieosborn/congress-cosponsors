(Currently, the authority to prosecute crimes is shared between DC and the federal government, while the authority to grant clemency is held by the President.)\n\nAdditionally, the bill eliminates the congressional review period that applies to legislation passed by the DC council. (Under current law, Congress reviews legislation passed by the council and may issue a joint resolution disapproving of the legislation; if the President signs the resolution, the legislation may not become law.)"
