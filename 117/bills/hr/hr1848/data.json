    "text": "Leading Infrastructure For Tomorrow\u2019s America Act or the LIFT America Act\n\nThis bill establishes several programs and incentives to modernize the nation's communications, drinking water, energy, transportation, health care, and other related infrastructure.\n\nFor example, the bill provides incentives to make broadband internet more accessible and affordable. It also establishes grants to implement next generation 9-1-1 services.\n\nIn addition, it supports drinking water programs, including the drinking water state revolving fund program. Further, it provides grants to treat perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as PFAS) in drinking water and to replace lead service lines.\n\nThe bill establishes a variety of programs to support clean energy infrastructure and address climate change, including efforts to (1) modernize the electric grid and make it more resilient, efficient, and secure; (2) increase energy efficiency in buildings; and (3) support renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nFurther, it provides incentives for vehicle infrastructure, such as incentives to develop infrastructure for electric vehicles and grants to reduce air pollution at ports by electrifying port infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes grants and programs for health care infrastructure, including by providing support for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, laboratories, and state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments.\n\nFinally, the bill reauthorizes grant programs to remediate brownfield sites (i.e., sites contaminated with hazardous substances) through FY2026."
