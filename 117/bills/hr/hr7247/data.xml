This bill makes amendments to the Apex Project, Nevada Land Transfer and Authorization Act of 1989, which provided Clark County, Nevada, with the option to acquire certain federal land referred to as the Apex Site for use as sites for industries that generate hazardous materials (including the Kerr-McGee site).

The Department of the Interior shall grant utility and transportation rights-of-way to the city of North Las Vegas and the Apex Industrial Park Owners Association for the connection of existing electric power, water, natural gas, telephone, railroad, and highway facilities to the Kerr-McGee site and the other lands conveyed in accordance with this bill.

 Interior shall also grant to the city of North Las Vegas and the Apex Industrial Owners Association such rights-of-way on public lands as may be necessary to support the development as a heavy use industrial zone of some or all of the lands authorized for sale by Interior within the Apex Site that lie outside the boundaries of the Kerr-McGee site.

Transfers by the United States of any additional lands or interests in lands within the Apex Site or rights-of-way issued pursuant to this bill shall be conditioned upon compliance with applicable federal land laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.

The withdrawal of the lands within the Apex Site shall continue in perpetuity for all of the transferred lands.</summary>
