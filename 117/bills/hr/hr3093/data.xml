  <summary date="2022-06-28T18:27:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Save Hotel Jobs Act

This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to award grants to hotel owners and operators to assist with payroll costs.

Applicants for a grant must provide Treasury with certain assurances, including that (1) the hotel, if in operation, experienced at least a 40% decline in revenue during a three-month period in calendar year 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019; and (2) the hotel owner or operator has a policy to offer employees who have been laid off during the COVID-19 public health emergency any same or similar positions that become available as a result of receiving a grant. All grant funds must be expended during the 270-day period beginning on the date the funds are disbursed.

If the hotel owner or operator receives loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, the grant must be reduced by the amount of such loans that are forgiven under the program, including loans received on or before enactment of this bill. For federal tax purposes, the grants are not included as part of the gross income of the hotel owner or operator.

The bill also establishes a tax credit equal to 50% of the expenses a hotel owner or operator incurs for qualified personal protective equipment (up to a maximum of $25,000).</summary>
