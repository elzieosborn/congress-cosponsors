This bill increases specified benefits and taxes related to, and otherwise modifies, the Social Security program. Changes to benefits include

 increasing the primary insurance amount for certain beneficiaries; revising the method for calculating cost-of-living adjustments by using a price index that tracks the spending patterns of older consumers; extending benefits through age 22 to full-time students who are eligible children of deceased, disabled, or retired workers; establishing a new minimum benefit for certain lifetime low-earners; and establishing an alternative benefit based on combined household benefits for widows or widowers in two-income households. Changes to taxes include subjecting earnings in excess of $250,000 to Social Security payroll taxes. No taxes shall be applied to earnings between the contribution base (the maximum amount subject to the Social Security payroll tax, set at $142,800 for 2021) and $250,000.

 The bill preserves eligibility for Supplemental Security Income payments and other means-tested programs, despite any changes to an individual's Social Security benefits under the bill.</summary>
