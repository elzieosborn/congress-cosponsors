This bill establishes that U.S. district courts shall have jurisdiction over any lawsuit based on an alleged violation of a constitutional right by the United States or any agent, person, or entity acting in the name of the United States. (Generally, the United States may not be sued unless it has consented to the lawsuit.)

The plaintiff filing such a lawsuit shall have the right to a jury trial. If the plaintiff prevails in such a lawsuit, it shall receive attorney fees and costs.</summary>
