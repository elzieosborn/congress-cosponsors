This bill allows certain military spouses to defer payment on their federal student loans for 90 days. Specifically, borrowers are eligible to receive this deferment if (1) their spouse is an active duty service member of the Armed Forces, (2) they have lost their employment due to a permanent change in duty station of their spouse, and (3) they provide certain documentation to the Department of Education. Loan interest shall not accrue during the deferment period.</summary>
