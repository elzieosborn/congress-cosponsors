First, the Consumer Product Safety Commission must consult with relevant stakeholders, such as data scientists and product manufacturers, and use artificial intelligence in a pilot program for a least one of the following processes: (1) tracking trends in injuries involving consumer products, (2) identifying consumer product hazards, (3) monitoring the sale of recalled consumer products, or (4) identifying consumer products that do not meet specified importation requirements related to product safety.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Commerce must consult with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other relevant agencies to study potential applications of blockchain technology (i.e., the technology that supports digital currencies such as Bitcoin), including the use of such technology to address fraud and other unfair or deceptive practices. Finally, the FTC must report on its efforts to address unfair or deceptive trade practices related to digital tokens (i.e., transferable units of a digital currency)."
