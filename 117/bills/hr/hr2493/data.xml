  <summary date="2021-06-16T15:00:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act of 2021 

This bill allows a beneficiary (or an heir of a beneficiary) of certain insurance policies in effect during the Holocaust to sue in U.S. district court to enforce rights under such policies.

An insurance policy covered under this bill must have been&#160;(1) in effect at any time between January 31, 1933, and December 31, 1945, and (2) issued to a policyholder domiciled in Nazi-controlled territory or Switzerland.

A court shall award to&#160;a prevailing beneficiary (1) the amount due under a policy, (2) prejudgment interest of 6% a year, (3) attorney's fees and costs, and (4) treble damages if the insurer acted in bad faith.&#160;

An action under this bill or state law related to&#160;a covered&#160;insurance policy shall be considered timely if filed within 10 years of this bill's enactment.

Judgments and agreements entered before this bill's enactment shall not preclude a claim brought under the bill, with certain exceptions. Neither executive agreements between the United States and a foreign government nor&#160;U.S. executive foreign policies shall (1) affect or preclude claims brought under this bill, or&#160;(2) supersede or preempt any state laws relating to insurance policies covered by this bill.</summary>
