  <summary date="2021-11-08T17:02:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Critical Infrastructure Employee Protection Act 

This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support state, local, tribal, and territorial jurisdictions in providing (1) priority COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) testing for essential critical infrastructure employees; (2) priority access to personal protective equipment, sanitizers, face coverings, and health-related or protective supplies necessary to safely perform essential critical infrastructure work; and (3) priority access to COVID-19 vaccinations for such employees. Essential critical infrastructure employees include, but are not limited to, medical and health care, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, and law enforcement.

DOT must also issue regulations to adopt guidance from the Department of Homeland Security during any future health crisis to account for the transportation sector and ensure it takes substantially similar action regarding prioritization for essential critical infrastructure employees.</summary>
