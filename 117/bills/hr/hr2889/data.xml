  <summary date="2021-10-29T15:49:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Fairness for Landowners Facing Eminent Domain Act

This bill limits the use of eminent domain by the holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to acquire land or property for the construction and operation of a natural gas pipeline facility.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the use of eminent domain unless the holder (1) obtains all federal and state permits required by law for the construction and operation of pipeline facilities, and (2) complies with all environmental conditions appended to the certificate order.

Additionally, the bill suspends eminent domain authority if (1) the holder requests a material amendment to the certificate, or (2) a federal or state permit held by the holder is vacated or remanded.

The bill also sets forth a dispute resolution process and related requirements to resolve disagreements about accessing properties prior to acquiring them.</summary>
