This bill increases the maximum amount of funding available in FY2021 and FY2022 for temporary assistance for U.S. citizens and their dependents who are returning from foreign countries due to a crisis and are without available resources. Under current law, the Department of Health and Human Services may provide assistance such as money payments and medical care to these individuals on a temporary basis. The bill designates the funding as emergency spending that is exempt from pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules and other budget enforcement procedures.</summary>
