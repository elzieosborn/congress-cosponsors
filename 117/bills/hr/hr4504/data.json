Biochar refers to carbonized biomass produced by converting feedstock through reductive thermal processing for nonfuel uses.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs the Department of the Interior (for land under Bureau of Land Management jurisdiction) and the Department of Agriculture (for land under Forest Service jurisdiction) to enter into agreements with tribes or tribal organizations to carry out biochar demonstration projects. These projects must support the development and commercialization of biochar on Indian forest land or rangeland and in nearby communities by providing them with reliable supplies of feedstock from federal lands."
