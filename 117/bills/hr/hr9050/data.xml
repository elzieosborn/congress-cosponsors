This bill addresses various issues related to border security.

For example, the bill

 authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to waive reimbursement for the salaries of DHS employees providing training to foreign-vetted law enforcement or national security units under an agreement with the Department of Defense; authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide air and marine support to foreign governments for certain operations, such as an operation to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States; and makes it a crime to destroy or significantly damage physical or electronic devices (e.g., fences or cameras) used by the federal government to control a U.S. international border with the intent to achieve certain goals relating to securing financial gain and breaking federal laws.</summary>
