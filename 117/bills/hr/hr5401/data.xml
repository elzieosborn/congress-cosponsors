This bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a task force that must evaluate the implications of amending the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to remove exemptions from environmental laws for spent nuclear waste and high-level radioactive waste in order to enable consent-based siting of disposal and storage solutions for such waste. The task force must provide a clear explanation of what constitutes consent-based siting. In addition, the task force may provide participation grants to help environmental justice communities on issues relating to the storage and disposal of such waste.</summary>
