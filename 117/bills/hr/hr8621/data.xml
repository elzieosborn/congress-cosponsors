This bill authorizes the Department of Transportation (DOT) to extend the duration of certain waivers for commercial driver's license applicants seeking to operate a school bus.

Specifically, DOT may provide a waiver that grants states, for a period not in excess of one year, the discretion to waive the engine compartment component of the pre-trip vehicle inspection skills requirement for a commercial driver's license applicant seeking to operate a school bus. Currently, a waiver cannot exceed three months.</summary>
