This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that payment for remote physiologic monitoring services under Medicare continues to be made for a minimum of two days of data collection over a 30-day period until two years after the COVID-19 emergency period ends and regardless of a beneficiary's COVID-19 status.

The CMS must also report on the appropriate number of days of data collection over a 30-day period that should be required with respect to payment for these and other remote monitoring services under Medicare after the emergency ends.</summary>
