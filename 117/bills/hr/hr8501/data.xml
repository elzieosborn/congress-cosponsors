This bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from providing funding to a state that permits abortions or that facilitates interstate travel for abortions.

In particular, the prohibition on funding applies to any state that

 lacks laws providing gestational protection at any stage of development; establishes a fund, commission, or similar entity to provide direct financial or logistical support to an individual traveling to the state to receive an abortion; or prohibits enforcement of another state's laws authorizing civil actions against those who receive or seek abortions, perform or induce abortions, or otherwise aid or abet such conduct.</summary>
