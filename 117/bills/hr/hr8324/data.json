    "text": "Health Share Transparency Act of 2022\n\nThis bill requires a health care sharing ministry (HCSM) to disclose specific information to individuals enrolling in the HCSM and to designated government agencies. (An HCSM is a faith-based organization with members who share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and who contribute regular payments to cover the medical expenses of other members.)\n\nThe bill requires an HCSM to disclose to an enrolling individual information such as (1) the average out-of-pocket expenses an enrollee incurs, (2) how to file a complaint or appeal a coverage determination, and (3) a list of the HCSM's non-reimbursable items and services.\n\nThe bill also requires that an HCSM submit annual financial disclosures and program information to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Internal Revenue Service, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. HHS is required to publicly post this information.\n\nAdditionally, health insurance brokers contracting with an HCSM are required to provide an enrolling individual with information about health insurance coverage that is available through Medicare, Medicaid, or a health insurance exchange, as appropriate.\n\nHHS may apply civil monetary penalties to an HCSM that fails to comply with the bill's requirements.\n\nFurther, the bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to publicly disclose information about consumer complaints regarding HCSMs."
