    "text": "This bill extends certain liability protections available for health care practitioners who provide voluntary health care services in declared emergencies through a community health center other than the one that initially sponsored them.\n\nCurrent law makes the liability protections available to volunteer practitioners that are sponsored by a particular community health center. This bill maintains the liability protections for a volunteer practitioner who provides services through a different community health center if the center (1) seeks the assistance of the volunteer practitioner to respond to a declared emergency, and (2) promptly notifies the Department of Health and Human Services that the volunteer practitioner will be providing services."
