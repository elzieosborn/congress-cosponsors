  <summary date="2022-01-05T19:29:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Coast Guard Combat-Injured Tax Fairness Act 

This bill extends the provisions of the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016 to the Department of Homeland Security, with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard when it is not operating in the Department of the Navy. That act directed the Department of Defense to identify (1) certain disability severance payments paid after January 17, 1991, to veterans with combat-related injuries, from which it withheld amounts for tax purposes; and (2) the individuals to whom such severance payments were made.</summary>
