This bill makes a series of changes with respect to the appointment, tenure, and qualifications of acting officials of executive agencies.

Among other things, the bill specifies that, for a position that requires an appointment by the President (by and with the advice and consent of the Senate),

 the first assistant to the office may temporarily fill the position only if the individual has been the first assistant for at least 30 days during the preceding year; an officer or employee of the agency who is directed by the President to temporarily fill the position may only do so if the officer or employee has served at the agency for at least the entire preceding year (rather than 90 days); and an individual who is a presidential appointee and is directed by the President to temporarily fill the position, including an acting Inspector General, must possess the requisite qualifications for the position as provided by law or regulation. The bill also limits the tenure of acting heads of agencies to no more than 120 days (rather than 210 days).</summary>
