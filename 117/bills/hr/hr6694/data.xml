This bill expands restrictions on investment practices and requirements for financial disclosures that apply to specified high-level government officials.

In particular, the bill bars individual stock trading by (1) Members of Congress, (2) the President and Vice President, (3) Supreme Court Justices, (4) governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and (5) presidents and vice presidents of Federal Reserve banks.

Additionally, the bill requires financial disclosures to include loans, contracts, and other benefits (excluding salaries, compensation, or tax refunds) from the federal government. It also requires additional officials, namely judges and senior leaders of Federal Reserve banks, to make the disclosures.

Further, the bill directs supervising ethics agencies to make the disclosures publicly available in formats that are easily searchable, sortable, and downloadable.</summary>
