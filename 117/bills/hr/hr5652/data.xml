This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish an Acquisition Review Board to support the Management Directorate in managing DHS acquisitions.

The bill lists the board's responsibilities, which include determining whether a proposed acquisition has met the requirements of key phases of the acquisition life cycle framework and is able to proceed to the next phase.

The chair of the board must ensure that all actions and decisions made pursuant to the board's responsibilities are documented in an acquisition decision memorandum that includes specified elements, such as the rationale for the decision.</summary>
