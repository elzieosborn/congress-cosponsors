This bill transfers the authority of the United States Parole Commission to the District of Columbia to make parole and supervised release determinations for eligible imprisoned felons under District laws. The commission's authority or jurisdiction&#8212;including rulemaking and legislative responsibility for such parole matters&#8212;shall expire on October 31, 2022, and the District's authority or jurisdiction shall begin on November 1, 2022.

In addition, the bill provides for continuation of federal retirement and annuity benefits for former employees of the commission as of October 31, 2022, and who, on or after such date, are employees of the District office that exercises such transferred authority.
