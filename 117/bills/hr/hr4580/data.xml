This bill establishes a program within the Department of Agriculture to make payments to certain producers of seasonal and perishable crops that experienced a decline in market price because of imports of such crops. The bill also sets out a method for calculating these payments.

To be eligible for the payments, producers must earn less than a specified limit and derive at least 75% of their adjusted gross income from farming, ranching, or forestry.</summary>
