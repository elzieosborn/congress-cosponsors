This bill specifies that investigational drugs that are provided directly to individuals from manufacturers without the need for federal regulatory approval (i.e., via the Right to Try pathway) are exempt from restrictions that would otherwise apply under the Controlled Substances Act (e.g., restrictions on the use or possession of schedule I controlled substances).</summary>
