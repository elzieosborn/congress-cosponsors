This bill provides weekly payments to individuals who forego Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation by finding work with a new employer. An eligible individual receives a weekly payment of $180 for each week that the individual remains employed with the new employer, up to a maximum of nine weeks. This bonus payment is only available for weeks of employment after the bill is enacted and prior to September 6, 2021.

These payments, made by states under the bill, are subject to 100% federal reimbursement in the same manner as Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments.</summary>
