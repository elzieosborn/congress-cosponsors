The plan must also contain provisions to strengthen domestic capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredient production, storage, and conversion.\n\nWithin one year of this bill's enactment, the plan must include at least 25 of the essential generic medicines on the required list. The plan must add at least 25 medicines each year until the full list is covered.\n\nHHS must prioritize domestically manufactured key starting materials for the reserve to the maximum extent possible.\n\nA manufacturer of an essential generic medicine that switches to an active pharmaceutical ingredient sourced through the reserve shall not have to update the approved application for that medicine.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing, including the time and costs needed to develop domestic manufacturing capabilities."
