    "text": "This bill establishes repayment terms for federally-related mortgages in forbearance as part of existing COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) economic aid programs. Specifically, the term of such a mortgage must be extended for the same length of time as the length of the forbearance. Additionally, the payments due during the forbearance must be evenly distributed across future payments with no additional interest or fees beyond amounts otherwise due had the borrower made such payments on time and in full."
