    "text": "No More Tulias: Drug Law Enforcement Evidentiary Standards Improvement Act of 2021 This bill establishes new requirements for states that receive funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program or under another law enforcement assistance program of the Department of Justice. Specifically, to be eligible for funds, states must either not fund antidrug task forces or have in effect laws that require convictions for drug offenses to be supported by evidence other than eyewitness testimony of a law enforcement officer or other individual acting on behalf of a law enforcement officer, and ensure law enforcement officers who participate in antidrug task forces are evaluated for integrity and honesty. Additionally, an eligible state that receives funds because these laws are in effect must collect and report data on criminal charges, including the racial distribution, nature, and location of such charges."
