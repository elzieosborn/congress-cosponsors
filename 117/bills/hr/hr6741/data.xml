This bill prohibits the use of federal funds to operate or control an injection center (i.e., a medically supervised injection site) in violation of a federal statute commonly known as the Crack House Statute. The statute generally prohibits making facilities available for the purpose of unlawfully using a controlled substance.

The bill also prohibits (1) federal funds from being made available to any state, local, tribal, or private entity that operates or controls such an injection center; and (2) the use of federal funds by a federal agency to purchase or provide any drug paraphernalia directly or indirectly through grants or other assistance.</summary>
