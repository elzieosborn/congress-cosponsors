This bill temporarily establishes a daily public reporting requirement for covered contract awards of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Covered contract award means a contract action of DHS with a total authorized dollar amount of $4 million or greater, including contract awards governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation and those made with other than full and open competition.

DHS must post, maintain, and update on a publicly available website a daily report of all covered contract awards, except for such awards relating to classified products, programs, or services. The report must include specified information regarding each covered contract award, including information relating to (1) the contract type and value, (2) the name and address of the vendor, and (3) the contracting office.

This bill shall cease to have effect five years after the enactment date.</summary>
