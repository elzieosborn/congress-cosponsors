In addition, the bill outlines criteria FERC must consider before granting such a certificate. In addition to existing environmental review requirements, FERC must meet new environmental review requirements for interstate natural gas pipeline projects, including the requirement to consider the cumulative impacts of other natural gas pipeline projects as specified by this bill.Finally, FERC must monitor approved pipeline projects for five years to ensure that environmental mitigation steps have been implemented."
