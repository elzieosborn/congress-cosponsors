  <summary date="2022-06-09T11:20:34Z" status="Public Law">Homeland Security for Children Act

This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that the needs of children are considered in homeland security planning.

Specifically, each DHS office and component must take into account the needs of children, including children within underserved communities, in mission planning and execution. DHS must require each office and component to seek advice and feedback from organizations representing the needs of children.

The bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to identify and integrate the needs of children into activities to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against the risk of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other disasters, including by appointing a technical expert to coordinate such integration.</summary>
