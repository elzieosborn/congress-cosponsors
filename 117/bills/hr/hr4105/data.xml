This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand the list of permitted essential travel into the United States through land ports of entry along the U.S.-Canada border.

Specifically, it shall be permitted essential travel to enter the United States through the U.S.-Canada land border to (1) visit a family member who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, (2) visit property that the traveler owns or leases, (3) attend business meetings or site visits, or (4) board a flight for travel.

Within 20 days of this bill's enactment, DHS must report to Congress a plan to fully restore nonessential travel into the United States through this land border.&#160;</summary>
