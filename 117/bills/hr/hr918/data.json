(Currently, state Medicaid programs have the option to cover COVID-19 testing for uninsured individuals.)\n\nThe bill also (1) specifically allows COVID-19 testing, vaccines, prevention, and treatment, as well as prevention and treatment for complicating conditions, for certain unlawful aliens to be covered under Medicaid during the public health emergency; and (2) specifies how the value and provision of COVID-19 assistance should be considered with respect to certain governmental programs and requirements."
