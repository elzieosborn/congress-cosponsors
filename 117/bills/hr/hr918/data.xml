  <summary date="2021-03-18T18:56:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Stronger Medicaid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic Act

This bill allows COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) vaccines, prevention, and treatment, as well as prevention and treatment for conditions that may complicate COVID-19 treatment, for uninsured individuals to be covered under Medicaid during the public health emergency. (Currently, state Medicaid programs have the option to cover COVID-19 testing for uninsured individuals.)

The bill also (1) specifically allows COVID-19 testing, vaccines, prevention, and treatment, as well as prevention and treatment for complicating conditions, for certain unlawful aliens to be covered under Medicaid during the public health emergency; and (2) specifies how the value and provision of COVID-19 assistance should be considered with respect to certain governmental programs and requirements.</summary>
