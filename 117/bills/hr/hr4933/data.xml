This bill establishes a competitive grant program for states to provide area agencies on aging and local nutrition service providers with funding to purchase or repair vehicles for delivering meals to older individuals. The vehicles must be capable of safely storing hot and cold foods.

In awarding these grants, the Administration on Aging shall prioritize states based on the proportion of older adults in their populations, poverty rates, and unmet need for nutrition services.</summary>
