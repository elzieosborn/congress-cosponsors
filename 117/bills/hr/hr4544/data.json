    "text": "Workforce Opportunity Realignment Kickstart Act or the WORK Act\n\nThis bill modifies requirements for states with respect to the administration of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds.\n\nSpecifically, the bill (1) establishes new performance indicators related to employment and educational outcomes for states receiving TANF funds; (2) increases the percentage of TANF funds, from 30% to 50%, that may be used to support other state programs; and (3) allows states to use TANF funds to carry out certain workforce development programs. Under current law, states may use TANF funds to support other state programs only if they are related to Child Care and Development Block Grants or Social Services Block Grants.\n\nStates must negotiate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a level of performance for each indicator, taking into account certain economic, demographic, and other factors. HHS must periodically revise levels of performance for states to reflect economic and other conditions."
