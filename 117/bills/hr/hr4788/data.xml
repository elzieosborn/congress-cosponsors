This bill modifies the application of the windfall elimination provision (WEP), which reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who receive both Social Security and a pension from non-covered employment.

Specifically, the bill eliminates the WEP for individuals whose combined monthly benefits from Social Security and non-covered public pensions are below $5,500, and it applies a partial WEP reduction to those whose combined monthly benefits are between $5,500 and $6,333.</summary>
