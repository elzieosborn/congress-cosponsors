Additionally, FEMA must establish metrics to measure the efficacy of the process and seek input from relevant representatives of state, regional, local, and tribal governments; community-based organizations; subject matter experts; and individuals from underserved communities impacted by disasters.\n\nFEMA must designate a senior official as an equity advisor. The bill establishes in FEMA an Equity Enterprise Steering Group.\n\nThe chief executive officer of an affected county may submit a request for a presidential declaration that a major disaster exists if (1) the governor of the state or territory in which the county is located does not request such a declaration, (2) the affected county is not included in a request for assistance made by such governor, or (3) the affected county communicates with that governor about the disaster or potential request for a major disaster declaration before the relevant period has lapsed.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall issue a report describing the factors that FEMA considers when evaluating a request from a governor to declare that a major disaster or emergency exists and to authorize specified assistance."
