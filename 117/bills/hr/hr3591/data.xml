This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement motor vehicle safety standards that (1) require certain truck-tractors with electronic stability control systems to be equipped with an automatic emergency braking system, (2) establish performance requirements for such braking systems, and (3) require such systems to be used while the truck-tractors are in operation.

DOT must also study and report on equipping commercial motor vehicles with automatic emergency braking to avoid or mitigate a collision with an obstacle in the path of the vehicle.</summary>
