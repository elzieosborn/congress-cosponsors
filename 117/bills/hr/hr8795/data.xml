This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to prepare a minority impact assessment for each bill or joint resolution that establishes or modifies a crime, criminal penalties, or pretrial, sentencing, or probation procedures, or that could otherwise affect the number of people who are federally incarcerated, and that is under the jurisdiction of specified congressional subcommittees; GAO must also prepare assessments for similar proposed rules. Assessments must include information relating to the fiscal and demographic impact of proposed changes on prisons, prison populations, and the criminal justice system.</summary>
