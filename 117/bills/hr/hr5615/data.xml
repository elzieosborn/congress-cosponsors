This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to submit to Congress a plan to make federal assistance available to certain urban areas that previously received Urban Area Security Initiative funding to preserve homeland security capabilities related to acts of terrorism.

In developing the plan, FEMA must survey urban areas that did not receive grant funding related to preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to acts of terrorism in the current fiscal year that (1) are at risk of being reduced or eliminated without such assistance, or (2) received funding in the current fiscal year but not in at least one of the six preceding fiscal years.

The plan must (1) establish eligibility criteria for urban areas to receive federal assistance, (2) identify annual funding levels for such assistance in accordance with the survey, and (3) consider a range of approaches to make such assistance available to such urban areas.</summary>
