This bill allows state Medicaid programs to cover residential addiction treatment facility services for adults between the ages of 22 and 64 if such services are offered as part of a full continuum of evidence-based treatment services. Residential addiction treatment facility services are medically necessary inpatient services provided in an accredited, size-limited facility for the purpose of treating a substance-use disorder within a specified time period.

In addition, the bill establishes a grant program for states to expand infrastructure and treatment capabilities of&#160;existing youth addiction treatment facilities that (1)&#160;provide addiction treatment services to youths under Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and (2) are located in communities with high numbers of medically underserved populations of at-risk youths. At least 15% of grant funds awarded to a state must be used for making payments to rural facilities.</summary>
