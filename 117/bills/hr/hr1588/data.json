    "text": "Hydropower Clean Energy Future Act\n\nThis bill expands provisions related to renewable energy, including hydropower production, and revises the hydropower licensing process.\n\nThe bill updates federal renewable purchase requirements. Specifically, the bill requires the federal government to purchase an increasing amount of renewable energy, including hydropower. By 2026, 25% of the total amount of electric energy the federal government consumes during any fiscal year must be renewable energy.\n\nIn addition, the bill also provides an expedited licensing process for next-generation hydropower projects. The bill also revises requirements concerning the environmental review of certain hydroelectric power projects, including by designating the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the lead agency for the purposes of environmental reviews, allowing certain categories of projects to be exempted from such reviews, and establishing deadlines to complete such reviews. Finally, the bill establishes requirements about resolving (1) inconsistent or conflicting license terms, and (2) federal interagency disputes or disputes among federal and state agencies."
