Global catastrophic risk is defined as the risk of events or incidents consequential enough to significantly harm, set back, or destroy human civilization at the global scale.\n\nThe President must (1) conduct and submit to Congress a detailed assessment of global catastrophic and existential risk; and (2) produce a report on the adequacy of continuity of operations and continuity of government plans based on the assessed risk.\n\nThe President, with support from the committee, shall develop and submit a strategy to\n\n provide for the basic needs of the civilian population that is impacted by catastrophic incidents in the United States; coordinate response efforts with state and local governments, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations; promote personal and local readiness and non-reliance on government relief during periods of heightened tension or after catastrophic incidents; and develop international partnerships with allied nations for the provision of relief services and goods. The President must issue a plan to implement and operationalize the strategy.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security shall lead a national exercise to test and enhance the operationalization of the implementation plan.\n\nThe President must provide recommendations to Congress for (1) actions that should be taken to prepare the United States to implement the strategy, increase readiness, and address preparedness gaps; and (2) additional authorities that should be considered to more effectively implement the strategy."
