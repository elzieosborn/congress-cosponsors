Treasury must also award funds to approved state programs to provide follow-on investments.\n\nIf a state receives funds from an exit, the state shall use such funds to further invest in startups under the approved program. An exit is defined as the (1) acquisition of a startup in which a state has invested under the program; (2) sale of a share of such startup following an initial public offering; or (3) voluntary purchase of a state's ownership interest by the startup, investors, or existing shareholders."
