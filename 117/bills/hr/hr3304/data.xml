  <summary date="2023-08-01T17:12:43Z" status="Passed House">Advancing Uniform Transportation Opportunities for Veterans Act or the AUTO for Veterans Act

This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide (or assist in providing) an eligible veteran or service member with an additional automobile or other conveyance under the VA automobile allowance and adaptive equipment program. Currently, a veteran or service member with a specified service-connected disability or impairment may not receive more than one automobile or other conveyance under the program.

The bill authorizes the additional benefit for such veterans and service members (1) if more than 25 years have passed since the person last received such benefit, or (2) beginning on the day that is 10 years after the enactment of this bill if more than 10 years have elapsed since the person most recently received such benefit.

The bill also includes certain vehicle modifications (e.g., van lifts) under the definition of medical services for VA health care purposes.

Additionally, the bill extends from January 14, 2031, to May 16, 2031, higher rates for certain loan fees under the VA home loan program.</summary>
