This bill revises two programs to provide tribes with additional resources for child and family services.

First, the bill revises the MaryLee Allen Promoting Safe and Stable Families program by

 establishing a minimum grant award for tribes, increasing funds reserved for state court improvement grants, increasing the set-aside for tribes or tribal consortia, exempting certain plans from reporting requirements, allowing funds to be used for tribal customary adoptions, authorizing in-kind contributions to meet tribal matching requirements, and allowing tribal organizations to use the federal negotiated indirect cost rate in lieu of the administrative costs cap. In addition, the bill revises the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services program by

 modifying reporting requirements, authorizing in-kind contributions to meet tribal matching requirements, and allowing tribal organizations to use the federal negotiated indirect cost rate in lieu of the administrative costs cap.</summary>
