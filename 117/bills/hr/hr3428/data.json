The bill specifies that members receiving TANF assistance must (1) receive at least $150 a month in cash assistance under TANF for an extended period with an income of up to 130% of the federal poverty level (FPL), or (2) be elderly or disabled and receive cash assistance or ongoing and substantial services under TANF with an income of up to 200% of the FPL.\n\nThe bill also increases the maximum allowable resources for SNAP eligibility and specifies that certain allowances relating to energy assistance extend only to households with elderly members."
