  <summary date="2022-05-17T23:57:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Connecting Youth to Jobs Act

This bill establishes and provides funding through FY2031 for grant programs to address barriers to youth employment. The bill also excludes certain youth employment income from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility determinations.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Labor to provide formula grants to states and local areas, and competitive grants to community-based organizations and other eligible entities, to assist in carrying out subsidized public employment programs for youth with barriers to employment. Funding to states and local areas must be used for programs that lead eligible youth to unsubsidized full-time employment or to attainment of at least one recognized postsecondary credential. Grants to eligible entities must be used to match youth with employment barriers to subsidized employment programs funded by the bill and to provide hands-on work experience.

The Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report on the activities funded by the bill.

The bill also excludes from SNAP income eligibility determinations any income earned by a household member who is younger than 22 years old, is an elementary or secondary school student, and lives with a parent.</summary>
