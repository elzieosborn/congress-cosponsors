DHS may not release the individual if the individual is (1) facing charges for (or convicted of) an aggravated felony, (2) a member of a criminal street gang, or (3) subject to mandatory detention on various crime- or security-related grounds.\n\nFurthermore, DHS must review and determine whether the criminal history databases of countries around the world meet standards for accessibility, accuracy, and other factors.\n\nDHS may not release a detained individual if a background check for that individual is required from a country with databases that fail to meet the relevant standards."
