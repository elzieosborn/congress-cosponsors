    "text": "Deepwater Port Parity Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Maritime Administration (MARAD) to allow the construction of a deepwater port in federal waters off the state to which the port is to be directly connected by pipeline if the state developed an approved coastal zone management program and withdrew the program prior to January 1, 2012. Currently, a deepwater port may only be licensed by MARAD if the state developed, or is making reasonable progress toward developing, such a program. Alaska is the only state that withdrew its program before 2012. A deepwater port is any man-made structure other than a vessel that is located beyond state seaward boundaries and that is used or intended for use as a port or terminal for the transportation, storage, or further handling of oil or natural gas."
