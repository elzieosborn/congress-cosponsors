Qualified members of the Armed Forces are those service members who (1) are being separated or recently separated from active duty, (2) elect to be listed in the database, and (3) have been determined by the VA to have a military occupational specialty.\n\nThe database must list the following for each qualified member of the Armed Forces: name, contact information, expected discharge date, and military occupational specialty.\n\nThe VA must implement direct hiring and appointment procedures for vacant database positions and may authorize relocation bonuses.\n\nThe bill also requires the VA to train and certify veterans who served as basic health care technicians in the Armed Forces to work as VA intermediate care technicians."
