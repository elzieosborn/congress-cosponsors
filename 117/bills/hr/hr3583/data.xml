  <summary date="2021-07-27T14:28:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Never Again International Outbreak Prevention Act

This bill establishes measures related to international accountability for outbreaks of novel viruses and diseases.

The Department of State must establish lists of countries based on the procedures and standards each country has implemented to (1) identify outbreaks and monitor diseases, and (2) ensure that novel viruses and diseases are timely reported.

The President must take specified action with respect to countries that are deemed capable of implementing such procedures and standards but have not done so. The President may also sanction government officials of such countries.

Foreign state sovereign immunity is waived in any case seeking damages against a foreign state for (1) injury or death in the United States caused by a state's failure to abide by such procedures and standards, or (2) intentionally misleading the international community or the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the outbreak or spread of a health concern that leads to a pandemic.

The President must facilitate (1) an international investigation and report on the response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), and (2) an international audit of the WHO relating to its actions in response to COVID-19.

The U.S. Representative to the United Nations (U.N.) must request that the U.N. (1) review the WHO's response to COVID-19, and (2) recommend actions to improve future responses and ensure WHO accountability for identified failures. The Representative shall seek a global ban on wet markets (markets where animals of uncertified origin and health are sold in unhygienic conditions, dead or alive, for human consumption).</summary>
