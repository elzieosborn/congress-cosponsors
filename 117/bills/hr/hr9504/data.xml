  <summary date="2023-08-25T17:05:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Period PROUD (Providing Resources for Our Underserved and Disadvantaged) Act of 2022

This bill provides additional funding through FY2027 for the Social Services Block Grant to support the provision of menstrual products (e.g., menstrual cups and underwear, sanitary napkins, and tampons) to low-income individuals. (This grant is a flexible funding stream used by states and territories to support a wide range of social services.)

The bill also exempts the additional funds from sequestration. Sequestration is a process of automatic, across-the-board reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.</summary>
