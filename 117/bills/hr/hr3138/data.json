Grant funds must be used to implement, develop, or revise the applicant's cybersecurity plan or to assist with activities that address imminent cybersecurity risks or threats.\n\nCISA must establish a State and Local Cybersecurity Resilience Committee to provide state, local, and tribal stakeholder expertise, situational awareness, and recommendations to CISA on how to address cybersecurity risks and threats.\n\nCISA must develop and maintain a resource guide for state, local, tribal, and territorial government officials to assist with identifying, preparing for, detecting, protecting against, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity risks, threats, and incidents. In addition, CISA must develop and make publicly available a Homeland Security Strategy to Improve the Cybersecurity of State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Governments.\n\nFinally, CISA must assess the feasibility of implementing a short-term rotational program to detail approved state, local, tribal, and territorial government employees to CISA in cyber workforce positions."
