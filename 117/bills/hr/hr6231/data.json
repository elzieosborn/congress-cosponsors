The study must also assess the use of the VA disability benefits questionnaire forms to support the pilot program.\n\nUnder the program, eligible entities are those that administer a non-VA medical residency or medical fellowship program in the United States (or a territory of the United States) and are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency."
