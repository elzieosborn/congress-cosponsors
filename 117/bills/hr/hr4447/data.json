It also limits the opportunity for the FTC or a petitioner of a rule to make additional oral submissions and written presentations while a rule is under judicial review.\n\nFurther, a court may not set aside a rule promulgated through such notice and comment process on the basis that the FTC failed to complete a regulatory analysis."
