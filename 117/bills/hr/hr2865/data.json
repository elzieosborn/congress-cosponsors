    "text": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention Improvements Act of 2021\n\nThis bill addresses sexual harassment and sexual assault involving personnel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThe bill specifies that NOAA's sexual harassment prevention and response policy applies to personnel such as observers, at-sea monitors, and voting members and staff of regional fishery management councils.\n\nIt also requires victim advocates at NOAA to be full-time employees whose sole job is advocacy for survivors rather than a volunteer collateral duty of an existing employee.\n\nAdditionally, the bill expands reporting requirements on sexual harassment, sexual assault, and equal opportunity employment.\n\nThe bill also provides for a restricted reporting structure that allows survivors of sexual assault to receive services without triggering an investigative process.\n\nThe Office of Marine and Aviation Operations within NOAA must develop and implement a policy to report to the Coast Guard Suspension and Revocation National Center of Expertise the names of NOAA personnel who are under investigation for an offense detrimental to good discipline and safety at sea, such as sexual harassment or sexual assault or any other offense for which suspension or revocation of a merchant mariner credential is either mandatory or sought.\n\nFurther, the bill removes the requirements that acts of assault, resistance, opposition, intimidation, sexual harassment, bribery, or interference with a fishery observer be forcible in nature and occur on a vessel to be unlawful."
