    "text": "Stop Wall Street Landlords Act of 2022 \n\nThis bill denies certain tax and other benefits to large investors whose assets exceed $100 million in a taxable year for investment in single-family housing (i.e., real property including at least one dwelling unit and not more than four units). It denies such investors a tax deduction for interest paid on a single-family home mortgage, for insuring such homes, and for the depreciation of such homes.\n\nThe bill imposes an excise tax on the sale or transfer of a single-family home by a large investor equal to the price of such home. It allows a tax credit for home sellers equal to the lesser of either the excess of reasonable development costs paid over the sale price, or 35% of the lesser of eligible development costs paid by the taxpayer, or 80% of the national median sale price for homes.\n\nThe bill prohibits large investors from obtaining certain federal mortgage assistance."
