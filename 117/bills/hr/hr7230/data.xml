  <summary date="2022-03-30T17:52:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Family Health Care Affordability Act of 2022

This bill modifies the requirement for determining the affordability of employer-sponsored minimum essential health care coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). (Under current law, the coverage is unaffordable, and an employee may be eligible for premium assistance tax credits, if the employee's required contribution for an individual plan exceeds 9.5% of household income.)

The bill specifies that, with respect to an employee's family members who are eligible to enroll in the plan, affordability must be determined using the cost of family coverage rather than individual coverage to expand the eligibility of families for premium assistance tax credits.</summary>
