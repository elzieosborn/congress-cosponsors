This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a grant program to identify infrastructural barriers posed by transportation facilities within certain communities (e.g., communities of color, low-income communities, or tribal or indigenous populations) and study the feasibility of improving, and developing plans to improve, connectivity within these communities by redesigning or removing such barriers.

DOT may award grants to states, tribal and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and other entities for (1) community engagement, education, and capacity building, including to educate community members about opportunities to affect transportation and economic development planning and investment decisions; and (2) planning and feasibility studies, including development of designs and artistic renderings to facilitate community engagement.

It may also award capital construction grants to the owner of an infrastructural barrier to carry out projects for which all necessary feasibility studies and other planning activities have been completed, including the replacement of an infrastructural barrier with a new use or facility that has been identified by members of the community.</summary>
