Part of this rulemaking addresses reporting of workforce demographics by broadcast license holders.\n\nWithin one year of completing the rulemaking, the FCC must begin collecting demographic data pertaining to the broadcast industry workforce. The FCC may not use the collected data in its reviews of broadcast license applications or renewals or to assess compliance with applicable equal employment opportunity rules.\n\nFurther, the FCC must (1) include analyses of the demographic composition of the broadcast industry workforce in certain reports, and (2) maintain a database that includes publicly available ownership data of broadcast licensees."
