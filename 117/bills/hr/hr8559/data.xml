This bill increases the tax deduction for the payroll taxes of small businesses and imposes an excise tax on corporations for their stock repurchases.

The bill allows self-employed taxpayers earning less than $400,000 in a taxable year to deduct three-quarters (currently, one-half) of their payroll taxes.

The bill also imposes an excise tax of 0.8% on the fair market value of any stock of a publicly traded domestic corporation that is repurchased by the corporation during the taxable year.</summary>
