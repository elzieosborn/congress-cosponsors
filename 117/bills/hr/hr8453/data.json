(The agreement brought an end to the Bosnian War, and Bosnia and Herzegovina's constitution stems in part from the agreement.)\n\nThe Department of the Treasury may impose certain prohibitions and restrictions on a foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts or facilitates a significant transaction for a foreign person subject to sanctions under this bill."
