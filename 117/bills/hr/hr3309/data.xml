This bill establishes certain manufacturing incentives to increase trade between the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere.

Specifically, the bill requires the President to develop a strategy to reduce reliance on concentrated supply chains for covered articles (including those essential to U.S. critical infrastructure) and protect against any threats from countries of concern relating to supply chains for these articles.

Additionally, the bill establishes within the Executive Office of the President the Manufacturing Security and Resilience Council. The functions of the council include (1) implementing the President's strategy, (2) establishing and maintaining a database of information on manufacturing companies that manufacture a covered article or maintain facilities that may be converted to manufacture covered articles during an emergency, and (3) establishing and carrying out a manufacturing resilience grant program. An eligible manufacturing company may use grant funds to relocate manufacturing facilities and operations out of a country of concern into the United States or another country in the Western Hemisphere.

The bill authorizes the President to provide duty-free treatment to any eligible article from any beneficiary Western Hemisphere country. This treatment shall apply to any article (1) that is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary Western Hemisphere country; and (2) that is needed to support the critical infrastructure of the United States.

The bill also includes certain tax incentives, including by establishing an American security product tax credit.</summary>
