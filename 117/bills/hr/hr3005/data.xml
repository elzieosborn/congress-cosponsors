  <summary date="2021-07-07T16:26:39Z" status="Passed House">This bill provides for the removal of certain statues and busts from display in the Capitol.

The bill directs the Joint Committee on the Library to remove the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court chamber of the Capitol and to obtain a bust of Thurgood Marshall with which to replace it.

The Joint Committee on the Library must remove all Confederate statutes and busts, as well as the statues of Charles Brantley Aycock, John Caldwell Calhoun, and James Paul Clarke, from areas of the Capitol accessible to the public. Furthermore, the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) must store each removed statue.

Additionally, the bill

 prohibits the display of statues in National Statuary Hall of persons who served voluntarily with the Confederate States of America or in the military forces or government of a state while it was in rebellion against the United States; requires the AOC to identify such statues and the Joint Committee on the Library to arrange for their removal; requires each statue to be returned to the providing state if the state requests and agrees to pay any transportation-related costs; and permits a state that has a statue removed to replace the statue.</summary>
