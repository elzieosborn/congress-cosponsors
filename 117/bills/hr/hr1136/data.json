Each executive agency must develop an agency-specific plan to increase diversity, pursuant to OPM and OMB guidance, and periodically publish specified data. The legislative and judicial branches of government must also implement these requirements to the greatest extent possible.\n\nAdditionally, each executive agency, and each prime contractor that is under contract with an executive agency, must periodically report information relating to economically and socially disadvantaged businesses."
