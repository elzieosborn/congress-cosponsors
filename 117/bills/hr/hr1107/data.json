    "text": "Protecting Local Authority and Neighborhoods Act or the PLAN Act\n\nThis bill limits liability protection that applies to a provider of an interactive computer service that facilitates the lease or rental of real property (e.g., Airbnb) in violation of a state law or contractual agreement, such as a lease provision prohibiting short-term rentals.\n\nCurrent law protects providers and users of such services from liability for information provided by third parties, subject to specified exceptions. This bill removes that protection for providers that facilitate certain real estate transactions if the provider (1) receives written notice that a lease or rental violates a law or contractual agreement, and (2) subsequently facilitates the lease or rental in a manner restricted by the applicable law or contractual agreement.\n\nThe bill also expressly preserves the authority of a state or locality to enforce laws that restrict a provider of an interactive computer service from booking, or providing ancillary services for, a transaction for the lease or rental of real property."
