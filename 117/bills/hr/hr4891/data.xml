  <summary date="2022-03-01T21:25:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Net-Negative Carbon Dioxide Baseload Power Act

This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a net-negative carbon dioxide baseload power development and commercialization program. Under the program, DOE must (1) facilitate the redevelopment of existing coal-fueled power plant sites with certain technologies that enable them to generate power with net-negative carbon dioxide emissions, and (2) lessen the economic impact from climate change policies on communities dependent upon coal-fueled power plants.</summary>
