Specifically, securities registration is not required for a sale of securities if the total amount of securities sold by the issuer during the preceding 12-month period sale does not exceed $250,000.\n\nFurthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission must issue rules under which an issuer is disqualified from offering securities through this exemption. These rules must disqualify any such offering or sale of securities by a person subject to specified regulatory disciplinary actions or convicted of certain felonies or misdemeanors."
