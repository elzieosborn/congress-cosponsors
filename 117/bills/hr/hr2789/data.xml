  <summary date="2021-07-12T18:42:23Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of the Interior to jointly establish a pilot program to employ veterans in positions that relate to the conservation and resource management activities of USDA and Interior. The VA, USDA, Interior, and the Department of Defense (DOD) are authorized to enter into a partnership to include the pilot program as part of the Skillbridge program, which is a DOD program to provide training to members who are transitioning out of service in the Armed Forces.

The bill also requires the VA to establish guidelines containing best practices for other federal agencies that carry out programs to employ veterans who are transitioning from service in the Armed Forces.</summary>
