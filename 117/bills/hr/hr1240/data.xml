This bill expands relief under the federal crop insurance program for agricultural producers that harvest second crops as a result of a prevented planting.

Specifically, a producer may collect 100% of the prevented planting guarantee for the acreage of the first crop if (1) the acres planted are in an area with low hay or forage supplies due to widespread excessive moisture, flood, or drought; (2) the second crop will be planted with an intended use of animal feed that is hayed, gazed, or chopped; and (3) the second crop will be donated or used by the producer.

Additionally, the Department of Agriculture may not reduce the amount of a payment collected by a producer that hays, grazes, or chops over crops on prevented planting acres after the harvest date that it establishes for each region of the United States.</summary>
