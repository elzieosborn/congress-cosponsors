This bill prohibits limiting access to organ transplants based on an individual's COVID-19 vaccination status.

Specifically, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network may not (1) request an individual's COVID-19 vaccination status when considering whether to place the individual on an organ transplant waitlist, or (2) require the vaccination in order for an individual to receive an organ transplant. This network is a public-private partnership that links organizations (e.g., transplantation centers and laboratories) in the organ donation and transplantation system.</summary>
