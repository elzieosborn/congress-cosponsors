    "text": "Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act of 2022 or the EARN IT Act of 2022\n\nThis bill revises the federal framework governing the prevention of online sexual exploitation of children.\n\nThe bill establishes the National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention. The commission must develop best practices for interactive computer services providers (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) to prevent, reduce, and respond to the online sexual exploitation of children.\n\nAdditionally, the bill limits the liability protections of interactive computer service providers with respect to claims alleging violations of child sexual exploitation laws.\n\nThe bill replaces various statutory references to child pornography and material that contains child pornography with child sexual abuse material.\n\nFinally, the bill makes changes to the reporting requirements for electronic communication service providers and remote computing service providers (providers) who report apparent instances of crimes involving the sexual exploitation of children to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Among the changes, the bill requires providers to report facts and circumstances sufficient to identify and locate each minor and each involved individual. The bill also increases the amount of time that providers must preserve the contents of a report."
