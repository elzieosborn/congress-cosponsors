  <summary date="2022-02-09T11:25:04Z" status="Introduced in House">People-Centered Assistance Reform Effort Act or the People CARE Act

This bill establishes the People-Centered Assistance Reform Effort Commission within the legislative branch to review federal means-tested welfare programs.

Means-tested welfare programs are those designed to specifically provide assistance exclusively to low-income Americans. The commission shall review all federal means-tested programs, excluding various specified programs such as the Social Security benefits program, Medicare, and Department of Veterans Affairs-administered programs.

The commission's review shall cover topics including (1) ways to make the benefits programs more efficient and streamlined, (2) opportunities to reduce costs by contracting with private entities or delegating to states, (3) any programs that should be subject to discretionary appropriations, and (4) changes to allow caseworkers to have a holistic view of the beneficiary.

The commission shall report its findings to Congress, and the report shall include proposed legislation to carry out the commission's recommendations.

The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader shall introduce the proposed legislation in their respective chambers. The proposed legislation shall be considered under certain expedited procedures, such as&#160;limitations on&#160;debate.</summary>
