This bill expands workplace protections for employees with a need to express breast milk. Specifically, it expands the requirement that employers provide certain accommodations for such an employee to cover salaried employees and other types of workers not covered under existing law. Further, time spent to express breast milk must be considered hours worked if the employee is also working. The bill also extends from one year to two years the available time period for such accommodations.

Additionally, before making a claim of liability against an employer, an employee generally must first notify the employer that they are not in compliance and provide them with 10 days to come into compliance with the required accommodations.

Finally, the bill provides certain exemptions from these requirements for air carriers.</summary>
