Specifically, DOE must establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced tools, technologies, and methods for low-emissions steel manufacturing. DOE, in collaboration with industry partners, institutions of higher education, and DOE's national laboratories, must also support an initiative for the demonstration of low-emissions steel manufacturing."
