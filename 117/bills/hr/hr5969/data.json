(Asylum officers interview each applicant for asylum and determine whether the applicant has a credible fear of persecution, a requirement to receive asylum.)\n\nThe Department of Justice must appoint or hire 200 immigration judges (and support staff) to serve in specified judicial districts in Texas, California, Arizona, or New Mexico."
