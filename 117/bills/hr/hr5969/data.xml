This bill modifies requirements for asylum applicants and addresses related issues.

Under this bill, an alien may receive asylum only if the individual entered the United States at a port of entry.

The bill also statutorily authorizes a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer who otherwise meets the relevant requirements to act as an asylum officer. (Asylum officers interview each applicant for asylum and determine whether the applicant has a credible fear of persecution, a requirement to receive asylum.)

The Department of Justice must appoint or hire 200 immigration judges (and support staff) to serve in specified judicial districts in Texas, California, Arizona, or New Mexico.</summary>
