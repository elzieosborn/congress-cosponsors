This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to continue allowing providers to use certain communication products when furnishing telehealth services after the COVID-19 emergency ends.

Generally, providers must use communication products that comply with applicable federal privacy and security standards; however, HHS issued a notification stating that it would not enforce penalties against providers who, in good faith, use noncompliant communication products during the COVID-19 emergency.

The bill requires HHS to revise applicable privacy and security regulations to allow providers to use noncompliant products for seven years after the COVID-19 emergency ends. HHS may elect to extend this period following a review of telehealth services furnished over those seven years.</summary>
