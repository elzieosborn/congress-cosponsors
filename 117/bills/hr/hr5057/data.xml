This bill directs each federal agency to require the level of telework of employees to return to the level of telework in place on February 14, 2020.

The General Services Administration must submit to Congress a report that includes a description of how, during the period beginning on February 14, 2020, and ending on the date of this bill's enactment, agency services and response times for individuals in the United States who benefit from services of agencies were affected by the increased level of telework and the limited access to physical mail, data servers, and voice mail at agencies.</summary>
