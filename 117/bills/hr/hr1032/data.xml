  <summary date="2021-03-24T17:03:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act

This bill establishes measures to address the workforce needs of the telecommunications industry.

 Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish an interagency working group to develop recommendations for addressing these workforce needs.

The FCC must also establish and issue guidance on how states can meet the workforce needs of the telecommunications industry, including guidance on how a state workforce development board can (1) utilize federal resources available to meet telecommunications industry workforce needs; and (2) promote and improve recruitment in qualified industry-led workforce development programs, including the Telecommunications Industry Registered Apprenticeship Program.

The Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress a report that estimates the number of skilled telecommunications workers that will be required to build and maintain (1) broadband infrastructure in rural areas, and (2) the 5G wireless infrastructure needed to support 5G wireless technology.</summary>
