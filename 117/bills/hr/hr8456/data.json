    "text": "Ocean Acidification Research Partnerships Act\n\nThis bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide grants for collaborative research projects on ocean acidification developed and conducted through partnerships between the seafood industry and the academic community. NOAA must prioritize projects that (1) address ecosystems and communities vulnerable to the impacts of ocean acidification, (2) demonstrate support from local stakeholders, or (3) utilize seafood industry assets as research and monitoring platforms.\n\nNOAA may provide grants to a partnership in which a marine-dependent industry is substituted for the seafood industry."
