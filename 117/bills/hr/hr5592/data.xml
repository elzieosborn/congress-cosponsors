This bill requires each executive agency to report on the effects of requiring its employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and certify whether such a requirement will adversely affect the ability of the agency to carry out its mission.

Specifically, such report shall include

 the estimated number of employees who do not intend to get vaccinated and would leave as a result, the effects on such agency's workforce and on its ability to carry out its mission, any agency plans to mitigate the loss of institutional knowledge, and estimates of how long the agency will take to fill the positions left vacant and the costs of filling such positions.</summary>
