This bill addresses identifying, restoring, and protecting salmon conservation areas and salmon strongholds in the United States.

Specifically, the bill

 requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to jointly issue guidance on the process and biological criteria required to identify salmon conservation areas and salmon strongholds; and directs the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in collaboration with NOAA to provide grants to certain entities to protect or maintain salmon conservation area or salmon stronghold features and projects that are focused on conservation and restoration within a salmon conservation area or stronghold, including to restore or maintain ecological functions and processes related to salmon productivity and diversity at watershed or subwatershed scales.</summary>
