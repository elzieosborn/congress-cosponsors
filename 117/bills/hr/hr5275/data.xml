  <summary date="2021-12-08T16:26:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Accountability in Assignment Restrictions Act

This bill sets out a process through which Department of State employees may appeal assignment restrictions. These are restrictions on an employee's security clearance that preclude the employee from serving in certain diplomatic posts or working on certain issues in the United States to (1) prevent potential targeting and harassment by foreign intelligence services, and (2) lessen foreign influence or foreign preference security concerns.

Specifically, the bill establishes the Assignment Restriction Appeals Panel to hear assignment restriction appeals from Foreign Service and civil service employees. Additionally, the State Department must annually report to Congress on its use of assignment restrictions, including the rationale for the restrictions, data about employees subject to restrictions in the previous year, and information about the appeals process.</summary>
