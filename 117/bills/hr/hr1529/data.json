The audit must include the accuracy of voting systems used in the election and an assessment of state compliance with applicable election laws and procedures, including those governing the requirements for voter identification and use of mail-in voting.\n\nThe Election Assistance Commission (EAC) must develop best practices for conducting post-election audits, including recommendations to (1) conduct an audit using a bipartisan entity, and (2) complete an audit within 30 days after the state certifies the results of a congressional election.\n\nAdditionally, states must attest to the integrity and security of their voter identification procedures and maintenance of voter registration lists.\n\nStates must submit to the EAC, and make publicly available on their websites, these audit results and attestations."
