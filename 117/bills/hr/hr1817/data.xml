This bill requires the Department of Labor to provide grants to local governments for developing a plan to transition workers from employment in fossil fuel industries to employment in sustainable industries (e.g., manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and renewable energy). Grant funds may be used to develop a transition plan, support an existing or new apprenticeship program, or train individuals who are new to the workforce in sustainable industries.

The bill also establishes within Labor the National Employment Corps. The corps must provide grants to local and Tribal governments to provide direct employment projects for workers not successfully transitioned to employment in a sustainable industry.</summary>
