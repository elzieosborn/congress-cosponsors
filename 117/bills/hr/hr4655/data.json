An eligible entity is a partnership (1) among at least one LEA, at least one community college, and at least one youth apprenticeship program or joint labor-management training program; and (2) that works with an employer in a state-identified high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sector or occupation that is serving, or seeking to expand its capacity to serve, youth apprenticeship programs."
