The bill further prohibits these operators from studying the behavioral patterns of subsets of users without first obtaining informed consent, and it prohibits designing online products that lead to compulsive usage by children. If meeting certain requirements, an association of large online operators may register with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as a professional standards body to develop and promote best practices and guidance for complying with the requirements of this bill.\n\nThe bill provides authority for the FTC to enforce the requirements of this bill."
