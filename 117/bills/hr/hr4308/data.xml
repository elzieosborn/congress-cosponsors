This bill establishes provisions related to the regulation of certain online wagers (i.e., bets) as Indian gaming.

The bill deems an online wager as occurring exclusively on Indian lands, and therefore subject to the jurisdictional framework that governs Indian gaming, if (1) the person placing the wager and the server that accepts the wager are located in the same state, and (2) the applicable state and Indian tribe have entered into a gaming compact.

For the purposes of regulation as Indian gaming, an online wager is deemed to be made at the physical location of the server or other computer equipment used to accept the wager, unless otherwise agreed to by the state and Indian tribe.</summary>
