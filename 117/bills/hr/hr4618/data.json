Specifically, the bill (1) reduces the reporting window for asset managers responsible for more than $100 million in assets to file ownership reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 45 days to 10 days after the end of each month, and (2) expands requirements to include direct or indirect derivative positions or interest (e.g., short positions) in such reports.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC must (1) issue rules providing for the public disclosure of short sale activity by institutional investment managers, and (2) report on the standards and criteria used to determine whether confidential treatment applies to an institutional investment manager for the purpose of filing certain reports."
