This bill prohibits certain elected officials from receiving premium pay as eligible workers through the Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund.

Eligible workers means those workers needed to maintain continuity of operations of essential critical infrastructure sectors and additional sectors as each governor of a state or territory, or each tribal government, may designate as critical to protect the health and well-being of the residents of their state, territory, or tribal government.

The bill makes an exception for an elected official who performs other work during the COVID-19 public health emergency that is unrelated to the elected official's duties.</summary>
