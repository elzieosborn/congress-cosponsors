The information in the report must be used as a baseline against which changes or variances are measured and reported on during the life cycle of the project. Projects must be managed by an interdisciplinary team that includes a certified project manager, a functional lead, a technical lead, a contracting officer, and other appropriate personnel.\n\nThe VA's Chief Information Officer must (1) exercise authority over the management, governance, and oversight processes relating to existing or proposed information technology of the VA's Financial Services Center; and (2) supervise the information technology employees and contractors of the center.\n\nThe VA must ensure its annual budget justification materials include\n\n a list of its active information technology projects and specified information about such projects, projected funding needs for projects, and a prioritized list of every proposed project that is unfunded."
