It also prohibits certain loan conditions that limit a borrower's opportunity to be heard in court in the event of default.\n\nAdditionally, the bill restricts debt collectors and debt collection practices by\n\n prohibiting a debt collector from representing to a service member that failure to cooperate with a debt collector will result in a reduction of rank or similar action, and limiting a debt collector's electronic communications with a debtor without the debtor's permission."
