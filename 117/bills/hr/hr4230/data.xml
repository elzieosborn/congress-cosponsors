  <summary date="2021-11-16T15:33:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Strategic Lebanon Security Reporting Act

This bill requires the Department of State to submit to Congress a strategy and report concerning the implementation of a United Nations (U.N.) Security Council resolution adopted on August 11, 2006, which calls for the disarming of armed groups along the Israeli-Lebanese border.

Specifically, the State Department must develop a strategy for implementing the resolution. The strategy must address Lebanon's control of its southern border, cooperation between Lebanon and U.N. forces, and prevention of border tunnels.

In addition, the State Department must report on the implementation of the resolution, including issues related to the Lebanese armed forces, U.S. security interests, and the extent of Hizballah's influence within Lebanon and its armed forces.</summary>
