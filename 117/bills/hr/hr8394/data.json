    "text": "Lawrence v. Texas Codification Act of 2022\n\nThis bill provides statutory authority for the right of individuals of the same sex to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits any state from enacting a law or regulation that infringes on any individual's right to enter into a consensual sexual relationship in the confines of their home and private life, including with respect to individuals of the same sex. (The Supreme Court held that state laws criminalizing private, consensual sexual relationships between individuals of the same sex were unconstitutional in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003.)\n\nThe bill allows the Department of Justice to bring a civil action for violations. It also establishes a private right of action through Section 1983 lawsuits (Section 1983 is a federal statute that allows individuals to sue state or local government actors for violations of constitutional rights)."
