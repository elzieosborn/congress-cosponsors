    "text": "End Transfers of Detained Immigrants Act\n\nThis bill imposes requirements related to individuals in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody during the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nICE may not transfer an individual between ICE facilities until the COVID-19 transmission rate in the United States meets or drops below a certain threshold.\n\nIn addition, ICE may not apprehend or transfer an individual between an ICE detention facility and a facility operated by an outside entity, such as a state or local prison, unless the individual is tested for COVID-19 and placed in quarantine (1) for 14 consecutive days, or (2) until the test comes back negative.\n\nThese two requirements shall not prohibit the transfer of (1) an individual solely to process that individual's release from custody, or (2) a minor from ICE custody to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.\n\nIf ICE cannot ensure compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 (including maintaining social distancing requirements at all times) in any ICE facility, ICE shall (1) immediately review the custody of all detained individuals in that facility, and (2) release individuals found eligible for release."
