This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a program that provides a $400 voucher to a low-income individual for the purchase of a connected device (i.e., a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer) for which the FCC shall reimburse the retailer.

The FCC must (1) collaborate with retailers to ensure the wide acceptance of vouchers and the wide availability of covered devices, (2) establish a website that links to offerings by retailers of eligible connected devices, (3) establish a catalog of such offerings that is accessible to consumers without internet access, and (4) advertise the availability of the program.</summary>
