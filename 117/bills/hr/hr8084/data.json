    "text": "Fire Recovery Improvement Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture to address post-wildfire flooding in certain communities adjacent to or downstream from Forest System land.\n\n Specifically, the service may carry out watershed protection and flood prevention measures to address the effects of flooding in communities that are (1) located on land not under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, and (2) threatened by post-wildfire flooding due to a post-wildfire burn scar on adjacent or upstream Forest Service lands. Upon receiving an independent hydraulic study that shows that severe and repetitive flooding is likely in such communities, the service may also carry out activities to mitigate potential effects of that flooding."
