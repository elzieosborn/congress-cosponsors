  <summary date="2021-07-28T14:48:55Z" status="Passed House">Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities Pilot Program Act

This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to take specified actions to assist veterans with education, employment, and housing.

First, the bill requires the VA to carry out a five-year pilot program to provide on-campus benefits assistance and counseling to eligible students at tribal colleges and universities. An eligible student is a student who (1) is a veteran, a service member, or a dependent of a veteran or service member; and (2) is eligible for any service or benefit under the VetSuccess on Campus program.

Next, the bill increases through FY2023 the annual funding limit for the Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses pilot program.

In addition, the bill authorizes the VA to provide educational assistance, including a monthly housing stipend, to an eligible veteran who is pursuing an educational program on less than a half-time basis during the veteran's last semester, term, or academic period of enrollment.

The bill extends to December 9, 2030, certain housing loan fees under the VA home loan program.

Finally, the bill extends to September 30, 2025, the authority of the VA to enter into agreements with certain entities to provide housing assistance for homeless veterans. The bill also revises the program, including by allowing the VA to enter into agreements with tribal entities.</summary>
