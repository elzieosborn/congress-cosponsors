  <summary date="2022-07-12T15:01:32Z" status="Reported to House">Securing the Checkpoint Property Screening System (S-CPSS) Act of 2022

This bill establishes requirements related to the Checkpoint Property Screening System program, through which the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) procures and deploys computed tomography equipment for screening carry-on baggage at airport checkpoints.

Specifically, the TSA must support small businesses with respect to research and development of technologies under consideration for the program.

Additionally, the TSA must brief the appropriate congressional committees at specified intervals regarding planned procurement and deployment efforts of such equipment.

If the TSA intends to make an award to a system that does not satisfy the program's key performance parameters, it shall brief such committees at least two weeks prior to any such award regarding why such award is necessary and in the best interest of national security and good government.</summary>
