    "text": "This bill establishes a U.S. policy to oppose certain financial assistance to Burma (Myanmar) and addresses related issues.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of the Treasury must instruct U.S. representatives to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the Asian Development Bank to inform the respective institution that it is U.S. policy to oppose and vote against any loan or financial assistance to Burma through the State Administration Council or any successor entity controlled by Burma's military. This policy shall not apply to humanitarian assistance implemented by an entity not controlled by Burma's military.\n\nThe President may waive this policy on a case-by-case basis upon certifying that doing so would substantially promote delivering humanitarian assistance to Burma's civilian population or otherwise support U.S. national interests.\n\nThis policy shall be repealed upon the earlier of (1) the President certifying that certain events have occurred, including Burma's military releasing all political prisoners and the instatement of an elected government following free and fair elections; or (2) 10 years after this bill's enactment."
