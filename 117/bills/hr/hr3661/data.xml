This bill addresses school security by requiring silent panic alarms in elementary and secondary schools and reauthorizing a program to train school resource officers.

 First, the bill requires that each elementary and secondary school have a silent alarm to alert local law enforcement authorities and emergency responders about a safety issue at the school.

Further, the bill conditions receipt of funds by a local educational agency (LEA) upon each elementary and secondary school served by the LEA being equipped with at least one panic alarm for use in a school emergency.

The bill reauthorizes for FY2021-FY2030 the school resource officers program.</summary>
