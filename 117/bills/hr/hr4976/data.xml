This bill requires the Department of Defense's (DOD's) response actions to address perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substance contamination from DOD or National Guard activities to meet certain standards. PFAS are man-made and may have adverse human health effects.

DOD must conduct such response actions to achieve a level of PFAS in the environmental media that meets or exceeds the most stringent of the following standards for each applicable PFAS:

 the state standard of the state in which the response action is being conducted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), a federal standard under CERCLA, or a health advisory under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</summary>
