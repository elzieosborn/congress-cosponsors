This bill establishes new, and expands existing, programs and activities to prevent and respond to seasonal and pandemic influenza (flu).

In particular, the bill addresses

 flu vaccine development, manufacturing, and supply chains; genomic sequencing, diagnostic tools, and other technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to flu; and public health communications and related efforts to increase flu vaccination rates and access to antiviral medications. The bill also sets out a process through which Congress may adjust discretionary spending limits to accommodate additional funding for health defense operations (e.g., flu-related activities).</summary>
