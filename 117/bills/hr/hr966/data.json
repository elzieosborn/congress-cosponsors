Further, a state is prohibited from considering failure to vote in an election or failure to respond to a notice as evidence of ineligibility to vote.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires a state to provide individual registrants who are removed with a notice, which must include the grounds for the removal and information on contesting the removal. Public notice must be provided after conducting any general program to remove the names of ineligible voters."
