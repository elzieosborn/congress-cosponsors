    "text": "Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2027, expands, and modifies programs, grants, and activities that focus on mental and behavioral health.\n\nSpecifically, the bill reauthorizes and modifies\n\n the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children with Serious Emotional Disturbances Program, the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Grant, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline program, grants related to suicide prevention, and grants to support the behavioral health workforce. Additionally, the bill expands access to opioid and other substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. For example, the bill (1) eliminates a provision that generally requires individuals to be addicted to opioids for at least a year before being admitted to an opioid treatment program, and (2) promotes access to high-quality recovery housing.\n\nOther matters addressed by the bill include\n\n coordination of federal efforts related to behavioral health; maternal mental health and substance use disorders; prevention and treatment of mental and behavioral health issues for veterans, members of the Armed Forces, first responders, tribal populations, and other specified groups; best practices for a crisis response continuum of care; eating disorders; school-based mental health services; coverage of mental and behavioral health care through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, including for juveniles in public institutions; oversight of pharmacy benefit managers; compliance with federal mental health parity requirements, including by self-funded, nonfederal insurance plans; and integration of behavioral health in primary care settings."
