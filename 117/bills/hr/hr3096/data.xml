This bill directs the General Services Administration to establish a program under which a federal law enforcement officer may purchase a retired handgun from the agency that issued the handgun to the officer.

The bill expresses the sense of Congress that amounts received from the sale of handguns should be used for evidence-based gun violence prevention or gun safety education and training programs.</summary>
