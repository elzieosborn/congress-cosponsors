This bill establishes certain election security measures and requires a report on blockchain technology.

Specifically, the bill requires a voting system used in a federal election to produce a permanent paper record for use in audits. In addition, the bill prohibits such a voting system from (1) connecting to the internet, or (2) directly tabulating a ballot that was transmitted online.

Next, the bill specifies that a state must carry out and complete a program to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official list of eligible voters at least 90 days before a federal election.

In addition, the bill directs the Election Assistance Commission to study and report on the use of blockchain technology to improve the security of federal elections.</summary>
