This bill requires covered institutions of higher education to ensure that prospective and enrolled students may use their financial aid for enrollment purposes, regardless of whether the student delays enrollment or takes a leave of absence for up to one academic year during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Covered institution of higher education refers to an institution that receives federal funds and offers in-person instruction at levels less than the first semester (or the equivalent) of the 2019-2020 academic year.</summary>
