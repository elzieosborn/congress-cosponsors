This bill authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) to release, without reimbursement or other consideration, a reversionary interest acquired by the United States when the National Nuclear Security Administration made a grant to support the acquisition of real property and construction of infrastructure located at 4170 Allium Court in Springfield, Ohio.

The authority of DOE to release such reversionary interest is conditioned on, and may be exercised only after, the acquisition of title to the real property by the Community Improvement Corporation of Clark County.</summary>
