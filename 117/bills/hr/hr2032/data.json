    "text": "Pandemic Supplies Production Act\n\nThis bill requires certain actions to manage the supply and distribution of materials needed to respond to the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nSpecifically, the President must immediately exercise authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure the supply of necessary materials during the COVID-19 emergency. That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.\n\nIn addition, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which is responsible for supply activities common to all military departments, must manage requests for and distribution of materials to respond the COVID-19 emergency and future emergencies or disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must reimburse the DLA for costs incurred to undertake these activities. In addition, the DLA must report on the raw materials needed for the mass production of COVID-19 vaccines and related topics."
