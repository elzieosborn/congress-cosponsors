  <summary date="2022-02-25T19:17:18Z" status="Introduced in House">One Agency Act

This bill consolidates antitrust enforcement authority in one agency by transferring all Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust functions, employees, assets, and funding to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The bill also transfers to DOJ the responsibility for reviewing specified communications transactions that is currently the duty of the Federal Communications Commission.

The bill does not remove the authority of the FTC to police certain unfair and deceptive acts and practices.</summary>
