The plan shall include a description of how the reopening plan was developed and the steps that were taken to include input from local small businesses and the public.\n\nThe bill provides for the recovery of funds by the federal government if the Treasury Office of Inspector General determines that a recipient has failed to comply with this bill's requirements.\n\nNeither the President nor any executive branch official shall take any action to issue a blanket ban on interstate travel or impose a national lockdown order or nationwide quarantine."
