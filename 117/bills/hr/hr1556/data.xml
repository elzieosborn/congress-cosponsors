This bill prohibits federal lockdowns and requires recipients of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) recovery aid to provide a reopening plan to the Department of the Treasury.

Specifically, the reopening plan must include a detailed description of how the recipient plans to reopen schools for in-person learning, remove restrictions on business activity, lift restrictions on religious services and other social gatherings, and assist families and small businesses in economic recovery. The plan shall include a description of how the reopening plan was developed and the steps that were taken to include input from local small businesses and the public.

The bill provides for the recovery of funds by the federal government if the Treasury Office of Inspector General determines that a recipient has failed to comply with this bill's requirements.

Neither the President nor any executive branch official shall take any action to issue a blanket ban on interstate travel or impose a national lockdown order or nationwide quarantine.</summary>
