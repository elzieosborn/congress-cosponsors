The GSA and executive agencies must review, identify, and publish information about all available properties. District of Columbia public schools must be given priority for available properties in the District.\n\nThe bill also authorizes state and local governments to use certain COVID-19 relief funds to further in-person education, including through leases of federal buildings."
