  <summary date="2021-11-04T13:36:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Leasing Every Available Real property Now Act of 2021 or the LEARN Act of 2021

This bill allows local educational agencies to use federal buildings in order to provide in-person education for students during the COVID-19 public health emergency.

Specifically, the bill allows the General Services Administration (GSA) and executive agencies to lease federal buildings for up to six months to local educational agencies for in-person education of elementary and secondary school students during the emergency period. The GSA and executive agencies must review, identify, and publish information about all available properties. District of Columbia public schools must be given priority for available properties in the District.

The bill also authorizes state and local governments to use certain COVID-19 relief funds to further in-person education, including through leases of federal buildings.</summary>
