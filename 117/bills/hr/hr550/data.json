These are confidential, population-based databases that maintain a record of vaccine administrations.\n\nSpecifically, HHS must\n\n develop a strategy and plan to improve these systems, including systems supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; designate data and technology standards for use in these systems; and award grants to health departments and other government agencies to improve their systems. As a condition of receiving the grants, recipients must use the designated standards. However, HHS may waive this condition in some circumstances.\n\nHHS must also report to Congress on these activities."
