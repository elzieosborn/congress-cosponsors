    "text": "Ensuring Access to Domestic Mineral Production Act\n\nThis bill limits the authority of the Department of the Interior to withdraw federal public lands from mineral exploration.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits Interior from making such a withdrawal until a study has been completed that demonstrates that the proposed withdrawal will not result in any negative impacts to national security by limiting access to critical minerals.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires Interior to obtain the approval of Congress before withdrawing federal public lands in excess of 5,000 acres.\n\nBefore any withdrawal is initiated, the U.S. Geological Survey must conduct a mineral assessment to ensure that the minerals to be withdrawn by a proposed withdrawal do not impede the ability of the United States or its allies to procure a secure supply chain of essential resources needed for the U.S. economy and allied nations, including resources for national security and for U.S. energy infrastructure."
