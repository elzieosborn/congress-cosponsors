This bill reauthorizes through FY2027 and establishes new mental and behavioral health programs. It also temporarily extends certain waivers related to the provision of telehealth services.

The bill reauthorizes the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant program, which supports the provision of mental health services for adults with serious mental illnesses and children with serious emotional disturbances.

Additionally, the bill reauthorizes grants for

 the Suicide Prevention Resource Center and other suicide prevention programs, including those in institutions of higher education, schools, juvenile justice systems, and other child- and youth-serving organizations; community crisis response systems; training teachers and other school personnel to recognize symptoms of childhood and adolescent mental health disorders; clinical education and training of students seeking to enter mental and behavioral health professions; and assertive community treatment (i.e., comprehensive services for individuals with severe functional impairments associated with serious mental illness). Further, the bill establishes (1) a national center to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and expertise related to behavioral health services for community recovery; and (2) grants for crisis call centers to hire and train staff, purchase or upgrade technology, and improve operations.

With respect to telehealth services, the Department of Health and Human Services waived, using emergency authorities, certain requirements that applied to services furnished through telehealth during the COVID-19 emergency. The bill extends those waivers for two years following the end of the emergency.</summary>
