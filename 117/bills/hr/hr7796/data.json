    "text": "Lake Lanier and Upper Chattahoochee Safety Act\n\nThis bill requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to review potential threats to human life and safety from the use of recreational areas at Buford Dam, Lake Sidney Lanier in northern Georgia. The bill also requires USACE to install technology necessary to alert the public of hazardous water conditions or to minimize or eliminate threats to human life and safety (e.g., sirens, strobe lights, and signage).\n\n USACE operates and maintains Buford Dam which forms Lake Sidney Lanier. The Chattahoochee River flows just below the dam. Water releases from the dam effect water levels in Lake Sidney Lanier and river flow conditions below Buford Dam."
