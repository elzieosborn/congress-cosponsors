This bill modifies firearms-related background check requirements for transfers involving a semiautomatic firearm, silencer, armor-piercing ammunition, or large capacity ammunition magazine.

For transfers by a federally licensed dealer, manufacturer, or importer to a private party, the bill lengthens the number of business days&#8212;from three to seven&#8212;that the federal licensee must wait for the background check results prior to completing the transfer.

For transfers between private parties, the bill establishes a minimum seven-day waiting period.</summary>
