This includes, as appropriate, transfers or sales to federal agencies and health care facilities.\n\nThe bill also provides HHS with additional authorities to manage the inventory. For example, HHS may enter into arrangements with manufacturers to establish revolving stockpiles to mitigate the risk of products expiring.\n\nHHS must report on its efforts to maintain the stockpile's inventory of testing supplies and personal protective equipment."
