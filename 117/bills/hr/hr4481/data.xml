  <summary date="2022-02-28T15:25:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act

This bill provides oversight of 7(a) loan agents, including by requiring the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a registration system for such agents whereby certain data may be collected and by mandating that such agents register with the system and pay an annual registration fee.

These agents provide referral and loan application services related to the SBA's 7(a) Program. Under the 7(a) Program, the SBA provides loans and loan guarantees to small business borrowers who cannot obtain credit elsewhere on reasonable terms and conditions.</summary>
