(Taiwan was expelled from the UN in 1971.)\n\nThe Department of State shall designate a senior level official to assist in implementing such policies and fulfill other related responsibilities.\n\nThe State Department shall also establish an Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel within the Bureau of International Organization Affairs to promote the candidacy of U.S. citizens for roles in international organizations, including the UN, and to coordinate support for non-U.S. candidates when appropriate.\n\nThe State Department shall increase by at least 50% the number of U.S.-sponsored Junior Professional Officer positions in the UN.\n\nThe President shall periodically review evidence and determine if any countries have engaged in malign influence operations that have threatened U.S. interests. The President must designate any such country as a malign global actor and provide an explanation to Congress for why the designation was made."
