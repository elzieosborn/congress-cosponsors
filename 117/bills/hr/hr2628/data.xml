This bill applies certain consumer protections regarding debt collection to debt owed to a state. It also specifies that existing limits on civil damages awarded for abusive practices by a debt collector must be adjusted for inflation.

A court may award injunctive relief for certain debt collection violations.

The Department of the Treasury may not contract with any debt collector or other private party to recoup overpayments of certain disaster assistance made to an individual or household by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), except in cases of fraud or deceit.</summary>
