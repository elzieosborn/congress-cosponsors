    "text": "American LNG First Act of 2022\n\nThis bill exempts certain vessels transporting methane or refrigerated liquid (commonly known as liquefied natural gas or LNG) from vessel documentation requirements as well as coastwise endorsement requirements.\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes a vessel certificate of documentation (i.e., registration) to be issued for a vessel transporting methane or LNG, unless the vessel is (1) owned by a Russian national or Russia, (2) a Russian-flagged vessel, or (3) a vessel with any Russian crew member.\n\nThe bill also authorizes a coastwise endorsement to be issued for a vessel that is transporting methane or LNG. Such an endorsement allows a vessel to engage in certain trade."
