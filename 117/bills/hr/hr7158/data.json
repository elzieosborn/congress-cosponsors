A medical foster home is a home designed to provide non-institutional, long-term, supportive care for veterans who are unable to live independently and prefer a family setting.\n\nVeterans receiving such care must agree, as a condition of payment for their care, to accept home health services furnished by the VA.\n\nUnder the bill, no more than a daily average of 900 veterans may have their care in a medical foster home covered by the VA.\n\nThe VA must create a monitoring system to assess its workload in carrying out the medical foster home payments. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress reports that assess the implementation of this program and provide recommendations for improvements.\n\nThe bill also extends certain loan fee rates through February 15, 2031, under the VA's home loan program."
