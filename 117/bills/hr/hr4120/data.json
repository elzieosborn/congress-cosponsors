The bill also establishes the right for courts to award injunctive relief to require compliance with consumer credit laws.\n\nCredit reporting agencies must provide (1) free credit scores to consumers along with their free annual credit reports, and (2) additional information regarding the calculation of their credit score.\n\nFurthermore, specified lenders must give consumers free copies of consumer reports or credit scores used for making underwriting decisions before consumers sign the respective loan agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the bill generally revises the information included on a credit report, including by limiting the inclusion of certain medical debt.\n\nThe bill also expands consumer credit protections applicable to servicemembers and victims of fraud."
