  <summary date="2022-10-14T18:25:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Defending Freedom of Conscience for Cadets and Midshipmen Act of 2022

This bill provides that a cadet or midshipman at a federal service academy (e.g., the U.S. Naval Academy) may not be required to be vaccinated for COVID-19 as a condition for graduation and may not be dismissed from the academy as a result of refusing to be vaccinated.

Cadets and midshipmen who are prohibited from fulfilling their service agreement due to their refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccination may not be subjected to repayment provisions (e.g., bonus repayment) or specified debt repayment collections.</summary>
