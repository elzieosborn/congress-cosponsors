  <summary date="2022-11-07T20:15:49Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill sets forth requirements related to amphibious passenger vessels operating in U.S. waters.

The U.S. Coast Guard must issue regulations for amphibious passenger vessels, including to require that operators provide reserve buoyancy for the vessels through passive means, such as watertight compartmentalization, built-in flotation, or other means, to ensure that the vessels remain afloat and upright in the event of flooding.

The bill also sets forth requirements for amphibious passenger vessels that are not in compliance with the regulations, including a requirement remove the canopies and window coverings of such vessels for waterborne operations, or to install in such vessels canopies that do not restrict either horizontal or vertical escape by passengers in the event of flooding or sinking.</summary>
