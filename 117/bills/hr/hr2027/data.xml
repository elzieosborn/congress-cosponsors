(Sec. 4) This bill supports efforts to increase science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at minority-serving institutions of higher education (IHEs), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges or Universities. The bill requires the National Science Foundation to award grants for purposes including building the capacity of such IHEs to increase the number and success of their students in the STEM workforce.

(Sec. 5) The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) shall develop a uniform set of policy guidelines for federal science agencies to carry out a program of outreach activities to increase clarity, transparency, and accountability for federal science agency investments in STEM education and research activities at minority-serving IHEs.

 The OSTP shall submit to Congress a report containing a strategic plan for each federal science agency to increase the capacity of minority-serving IHEs to compete for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements and to encourage such IHEs to participate in federal programs.</summary>
