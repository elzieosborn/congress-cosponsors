  <summary date="2022-01-18T20:08:41Z" status="Introduced in House">New Opportunities to Expand Healthy Air Using Sustainable Transportation Act of 2021 or the NO EXHAUST Act of 2021

This bill establishes incentives and related requirements to encourage the manufacture and use of electric, fuel-efficient, or zero-emission vehicles.

For example, the bill directs the Department of Energy to establish a program to provide rebates for expenses associated with publicly accessible electric vehicle supply equipment (e.g., power outlets).

In addition, the bill reauthorizes existing grant programs and creates new grant programs, such as grants for the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in underserved or disadvantaged communities. It also revises a loan program that provides incentives to manufacture advanced vehicles, including by allowing loans to be awarded through FY2031.

Finally, the bill establishes minimum conservation requirements for federal fleets of vehicles.</summary>
