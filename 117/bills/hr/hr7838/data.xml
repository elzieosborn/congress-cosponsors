  <summary date="2022-09-20T18:55:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Paycheck Protection Program Fairness for Engineering Services Act

This bill exempts until June 30, 2025, certain contractors that receive federal highway or public transportation funding from having to adjust costs associated with their contracts to account for loan forgiveness through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). (The PPP provided small businesses with loans for payroll and other costs to respond to the COVID-19 emergency with loan forgiveness under certain conditions.)

Under current law, a contractor with a cost-reimbursable contract must reduce costs or provide cash refunds to the Department of Transportation (or a state department of transportation) if the contractor receives or accrues any income, rebate, allowance, or other credit relating to an allowable contract cost, which includes PPP loan forgiveness.</summary>
