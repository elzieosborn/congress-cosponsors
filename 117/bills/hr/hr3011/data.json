(Current law authorizes the President to exercise certain economic powers, such as investigating or prohibiting payments, involving a person designated a Communist Chinese military company.)\n\nUnder this bill, the Department of Defense (DOD) shall apply the designation to a person (i.e., an individual or entity) with significant investments in certain technology sectors, such as fifth-generation wireless communications or artificial intelligence, if the person is owned by, controlled by, or affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party or any person who has ever been a delegate to the National People's Congress.\n\nThe bill also requires DOD to continue making periodic determinations regarding such designations until December 31, 2026."
