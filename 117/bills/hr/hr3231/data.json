Further, Interior must convey the subsurface estate for that land to the regional corporation for Southeast Alaska.\n\nInterior must also convey to each urban corporation any U.S. interest in all roads, trails, log transfer facilities, leases, and appurtenances on or related to the land conveyed to the urban corporation.\n\nThe bill also allows each urban corporation to establish a settlement trust to (1) promote the health, education, and welfare of the trust beneficiaries; and (2) preserve the Alaska Native heritage and culture of their communities."
