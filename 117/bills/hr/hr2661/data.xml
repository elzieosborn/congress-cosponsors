  <summary date="2021-10-28T15:03:56Z" status="Introduced in House">Environmental Health Workforce Act of 2021

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to carry out certain activities related to the environmental-health workforce. It also requires the Government Accountability Office to report on state-based practices for training and credentialing environmental-health workers.

Specifically, HHS must develop model standards and guidelines for credentialing environmental-health workers and a plan to ensure its programs and activities meet the future needs of the environmental-health workforce.

The bill also specifies that environmental-health workers are eligible for public-service loan forgiveness.</summary>
