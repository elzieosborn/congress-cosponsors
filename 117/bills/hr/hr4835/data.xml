  <summary date="2022-01-10T12:03:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Interstate Milk Freedom Act of 2021 This bill prohibits federal regulation of the interstate traffic of unpasteurized milk or milk products packaged for direct human consumption under specified circumstances.

Specifically, the prohibition applies if such products (1) would be considered in violation of federal law solely because they are unpasteurized; (2) are allowed by the state of origin to be distributed for direct human consumption by any means; (3) are produced, packaged, and moved in compliance with the laws of such state; and (4) are moved from the state of origin with the intent to transport them to another state that allows the distribution of such products for direct human consumption.</summary>
