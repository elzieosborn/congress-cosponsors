This bill requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, to publish a report on OPM's public website containing summary level information on the demographics of political appointees.

Each published report shall include for each type of appointee self-identified data on race, ethnicity, tribal affiliation, gender, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, and whether the appointee is over the age of 40. Such a report shall allow for users of OPM's website to view the type of appointee by agency or component, along with these self-identified data, alone and in combination, without allowing the identification of the appointee.

When collecting each category of data, each appointee shall be allowed an option to not specify with respect to any category.</summary>
