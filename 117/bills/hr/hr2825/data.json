The registry must also include relevant medical data of the listed individuals if they grant permission or are deceased at the time they are listed.\n\nIndividuals who have submitted applications, requests, or claims prior to the enactment of this bill must be included in the registry to the extent feasible.\n\nThe VA must periodically notify individuals listed in the registry of significant research developments on the health consequences of potential exposure to toxic substances or environmental hazards related to service at Fort McClellan. Additionally, the VA must reach out to individuals regarding the provision of health examinations and consultation and counseling services.\n\nIn establishing and maintaining the registry, the VA must consult with the Department of Defense to acquire necessary information."
