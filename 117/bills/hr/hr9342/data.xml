This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct an annual survey on all carriers and foreign air carriers to compile the policies regarding lithium-ion battery-powered wheelchairs and mobility aids of each U.S. air carrier and foreign air carrier and determine whether any of the policies are more restrictive than FAA safety standards or inconsistent with FAA standards for adequate protection.

The bill requires air carriers with inconsistent or more restrictive policies than the FAA and those that do not have a policy in effect to update their policies.</summary>
