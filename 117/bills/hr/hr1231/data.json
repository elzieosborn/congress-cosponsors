The United States withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018.\n\nThe bill prohibits the President from taking action to rejoin the JCPOA unless the President certifies to Congress that no sanctions waived or suspended pursuant to that reentry will operate to the benefit of (1) a designated foreign terrorist organization or its members, or (2) any individual or entity of the Iranian government that has engaged in gross violations of human rights."
