The bill also places limits on the repayment term for a microloan, and it prohibits the SBA from imposing any additional limitation on the term for repayment of a microloan.\n\nFurther, the SBA must (1) reserve 15% of new loan funds that are made available for disbursement as microloans to designated underutilized states and make the remaining 85% available for any state, (2) establish a process for an intermediary to provide the major credit reporting agencies with information about a borrower that is relevant to credit reporting, and (3) include information regarding equitable distribution of loan funds in its annual report."
