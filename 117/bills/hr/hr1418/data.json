It also establishes a grant program as a supplement to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program to support programs and activities during summer recess.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award five-year grants to local educational agencies for establishing policies at 500 elementary schools that align the school day with the work day. ED must report to Congress at the three-year mark and at the conclusion of the five-year grant period on best practices and recommendations for aligning school and work schedules, and for strengthening partnerships between schools and community resources.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires ED to carry out a supplemental grant program to establish or expand community learning center summer programs."
