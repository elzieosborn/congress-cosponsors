The office must issue final regulations relating to the safety of each reassessed substance.\n\nThe bill also specifies 10 substances that the office must assess in its first review.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must reestablish the Food Advisory Committee to advise the FDA on issues related to the substance assessments required by this bill."
