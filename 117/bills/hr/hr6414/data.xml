This bill prohibits the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) from requiring any drug or vaccine or other biological product to be administered to employees of health care providers as a condition of Medicare and Medicaid participation.

On November 5, 2021, the CMS issued a rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination. The rule requires health care providers, as a condition of Medicare and Medicaid participation, to ensure that staff are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.</summary>
