This bill requires each state or local government that received COVID-19 relief funding or funding under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 to submit a report to Congress detailing the amounts received and how such funds were spent. The report shall be made publicly available on a state or local government website.

Failure to comply shall make the state or local government liable to the federal government for the repayment of any such funds received and shall make such government ineligible for any future COVID-19 relief funds.</summary>
