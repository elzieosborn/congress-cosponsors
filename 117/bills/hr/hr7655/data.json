It also retroactively mitigates penalties associated with refusing to comply with such a mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWithin 30 days of the bill's enactment, federal agencies and private air carriers must remove from their no-fly lists any individual placed on a list solely because of a refusal to comply with a mask mandate.\n\nFederal agencies must also refund within 30 days any fines issued to individuals solely based on such a refusal. An individual who does not receive a refund in that time frame may sue for compensatory and punitive damages."
