  <summary date="2022-08-05T16:53:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Mindless Mask Mandate on Planes Act of 2022

This bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from mandating the wearing of masks, face coverings, or other accessories during domestic air travel. It also retroactively mitigates penalties associated with refusing to comply with such a mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Within 30 days of the bill's enactment, federal agencies and private air carriers must remove from their no-fly lists any individual placed on a list solely because of a refusal to comply with a mask mandate.

Federal agencies must also refund within 30 days any fines issued to individuals solely based on such a refusal. An individual who does not receive a refund in that time frame may sue for compensatory and punitive damages.</summary>
