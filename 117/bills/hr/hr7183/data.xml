This bill sets forth a special rule for the certification and designation of a population census tract as a qualified opportunity zone. The population census tract must have a population of zero, was previously used for industrial purposes and is a brownfield industrial site, and is contiguous, including by water, to a population census tract that has been designated as a qualified opportunity zone.

A qualified opportunity zone is an economically distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment.</summary>
