It also allows state Medicaid programs to cover juveniles who are pretrial detainees.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must also issue guidance on (1) ways to reduce administrative barriers for schools and school-based health centers to obtain reimbursement under Medicaid and CHIP; (2) how to expand mental, emotional, and behavioral health services under Medicaid; (3) existing Medicaid flexibilities to support children in crisis through more intensive services; and (4) strategies to increase access to telehealth services under Medicaid and CHIP."
