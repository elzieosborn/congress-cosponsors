This bill requires states to ensure eligible incarcerated juveniles are given health screenings and appropriate referrals under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in coordination with their release. It also allows state Medicaid programs to cover juveniles who are pretrial detainees.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must also issue guidance on (1) ways to reduce administrative barriers for schools and school-based health centers to obtain reimbursement under Medicaid and CHIP; (2) how to expand mental, emotional, and behavioral health services under Medicaid; (3) existing Medicaid flexibilities to support children in crisis through more intensive services; and (4) strategies to increase access to telehealth services under Medicaid and CHIP.</summary>
