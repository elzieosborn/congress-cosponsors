    "text": "Reserving Energy For Independence and Empowerment Act or the REFINE Act\n\nThis bill sets forth provisions to limit the sale and export of petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), increase energy production from energy producers in the United States, and make related requirements.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to issue regulations prohibiting the export of petroleum products (e.g., crude oil) sold from the SPR to (1) any country that is subject to a U.S. arms embargo as specified by the bill, (2) any country that is a state sponsor of terrorism, and (3) any entity that is owned by China.\n\nBefore DOE may sell, exchange, or loan crude oil from the SPR, DOE must first develop a plan to increase the percentage of federal land (including submerged land of the Outer Continental Shelf) leased for oil and gas production by the same percentage as the percentage of petroleum in the SPR that is to be drawn down.\n\nIn addition, the President must rescind the Executive Order titled Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis.\n\nThe President must also direct federal agencies to (1) identify and repeal any of their regulations that have the intent or effect of substantially reducing the energy independence of the United States, and (2) issue regulations and guidance to reduce the regulatory burden for energy producers in the United States and to increase the energy output by those producers."
