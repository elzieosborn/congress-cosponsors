    "text": "Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 or the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022\n\nThis bill addresses health care, presumption of service-connection, research, resources, and other matters related to veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during military service.\n\nTITLE I--EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE ELIGIBILITY\n\nConceding Our Veterans' Exposure Now and Necessitating Training Act of 2022 or the COVENANT Act of 2022\n\nSubtitle A--Toxic-Exposed Veterans\n\n(Sec. 103) This section provides eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care, including mental health services and counseling, to veterans who (1) participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (e.g., a qualifying activity that requires a corresponding entry in an exposure tracking record system, such as the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record); (2) served in specified locations on specified dates; or (3) deployed in support of a specified contingency operation.\n\n(Sec. 104) The VA must complete an assessment to determine (1) the personnel and material resources necessary to implement the expanded provision of care to the veterans specified in Section 103 of this bill (e.g., veterans who participated in a toxic exposure risk activity), and (2) the total number of veterans who served in specified locations on specified dates and receive hospital care or medical services from the VA, disaggregated by priority group.\n\nSubtitle B--Certain Veterans Of Combat Service And Other Matters\n\n(Sec. 111) This section extends the eligibility period for VA hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for combat veterans who served after September 11, 2001, and are toxic-exposed veterans, including those who did not enroll to receive VA care during the eligibility period.\n\nTITLE II--TOXIC EXPOSURE PRESUMPTION PROCESS\n\nToxic Exposure in the American Military Act of 2022 or the TEAM Act of 2022\n\n(Sec. 202) This section prescribes the procedures for establishing or removing presumptions of service-connection based on toxic exposure, including by providing for public notice and comment periods and the establishment of a working group to advise and make recommendations regarding toxic exposures during military service.\n\n(Sec. 203) The VA must conduct outreach to certain claimants when a law establishes or modifies a presumption of service-connection. Specifically, the VA must identify and conduct outreach for all claims for compensation for a service-connected disability that (1) were submitted to the VA, (2) were evaluated and denied before the new law went into effect, and (3) might have been evaluated differently if the modification had been applicable to the claim.\n\n(Sec. 204) The VA must conduct outreach to certain claimants when a law establishes or modifies a presumption of service-connection in relation to dependency and indemnity compensation. Specifically, the VA must identify and conduct outreach for all claims for dependency and indemnity compensation related to service-connected conditions that (1) were submitted to the VA, (2) were evaluated and denied before the new law went into effect, and (3) might have been evaluated differently if the modification had been applicable to the claim.\n\nTITLE III--IMPROVING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE CONNECTION PROCESS FOR TOXIC-EXPOSED VETERANS\n\nVeterans Burn Pits Exposure Recognition Act of 2022\n\n(Sec. 302) This section establishes a presumption that veterans were exposed to certain substances, chemicals, and airborne hazards during military service in specified locations in specified time frames (e.g., on or after August 2, 1990, in Bahrain).\n\n(Sec. 303) The VA must provide a veteran with a medical examination regarding the nexus between a disability and toxic exposure risk activity if a veteran submits a disability compensation claim for a service-connected disability with insufficient evidence.\n\nTITLE IV--PRESUMPTIONS OF SERVICE CONNECTION\n\nMark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act of 2022\n\n(Sec. 401) This section includes veterans who participated in the cleanup of Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands between January 1, 1977, and December 31, 1980, as radiation-exposed veterans for purposes of the VA presumption of service-connection for specified cancers.\n\nPalomares or Thule Veterans Act of 2022\n\n(Sec. 402) This section includes veterans who participated in the cleanup of radioactive materials at Palomares, Spain, or in the response effort following the on-board fire and crash of a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber in the vicinity of Thule Air Force Base, Greenland, as radiation-exposed veterans for purposes of the presumption of service-connection for specified cancers.\n\nVeterans Agent Orange Exposure Equity Act of 2022\n\n(Sec. 403) This section expands the presumption of service-connection for diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents for veterans who served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975. Specifically, the bill expands the presumption to cover veterans who served during specified time frames in Thailand at any U.S. or Royal Thai bases, Laos, Cambodia, Guam or American Samoa or the waters thereof, or on Johnson Atoll.
