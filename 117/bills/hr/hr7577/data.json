Currently, only states and certain local entities may apply for PHEP funds to respond to public health emergencies, such as COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC must award at least 10 cooperative agreements to tribal applicants.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC must consult with tribes and tribal organizations to ensure the PHEP program enables these entities to respond to public health emergencies. The CDC may make certain modifications to the program after the consultation."
