However, if the change is made fewer than seven days before the federal election and the individual appears at the previously assigned polling place, the state must make every reasonable effort to enable the individual to vote. Further, the bill specifies the methods of notification.\n\nIn addition, states must place signs at locations that no longer serve as a polling place."
