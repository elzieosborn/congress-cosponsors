  <summary date="2021-03-12T16:53:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Polling Change Awareness Act

This bill establishes minimum requirements for notifying individuals of a change in their polling place for a federal election.

Specifically, the bill requires a state that changes an individual's polling place to notify the individual at least seven days before the federal election or the first day of an early voting period, whichever occurs first. However, if the change is made fewer than seven days before the federal election and the individual appears at the previously assigned polling place, the state must make every reasonable effort to enable the individual to vote. Further, the bill specifies the methods of notification.

In addition, states must place signs at locations that no longer serve as a polling place.</summary>
