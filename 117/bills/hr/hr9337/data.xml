This bill expands the definition of critical infrastructure under the Critical Infrastructures Protection Act of 2001 in the USA PATRIOT Act. The term currently means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, or national public health or safety.

The bill includes certain sectors as part of the existing definition, including communications, dams, emergency services, energy, financial services, food and agriculture, healthcare, information technology, transportation systems, and water and wastewater systems.</summary>
