  <summary date="2023-08-15T14:33:20Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill eliminates the minimum age at which members of the National Guard and Reserve who qualify for a reserve retirement may receive retired pay. Current law generally requires reserve retirees to be 60 years of age to receive retired pay, although the age can be lowered if the individual has performed certain types of active duty or active service. Under this bill, reserve retirees could draw retired pay immediately upon retirement regardless of their age.</summary>
