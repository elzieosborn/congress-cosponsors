  <summary date="2023-01-03T15:33:49Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill addresses the regulatory treatment of fiat currency-backed stablecoins. The bill defines these as digital assets that (1) maintain price stability by backing the value with a nondigital currency, and (2) can be redeemed in that currency on a one-to-one basis.

Under the bill, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are prohibited from regulating fiat currency-backed stablecoins. The bill requires stablecoin issuers to hold all associated reserves in (1) government securities that mature in not more than 12 months, (2) fully collateralized security repurchase agreements, and (3) U.S. dollars or other nondigital currency.</summary>
