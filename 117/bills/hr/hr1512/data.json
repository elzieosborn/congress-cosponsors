    "text": "Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation\u2019s Future Act or the CLEAN Future Act\n\nThis bill creates requirements and incentives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe bill establishes an interim goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 as well as a national goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Each federal agency must develop a plan to achieve the goals.\n\nBeginning in 2023, retail electricity suppliers must provide an increasing percentage of electricity that is generated without the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (zero-emission electricity). By 2035, the suppliers must provide 100% zero-emission electricity or demonstrate alternative means of compliance. For example, the suppliers may buy credits under a trading program that allows entities to buy, sell, and trade credits to demonstrate compliance.\n\nThe bill also establishes a variety of requirements, programs, and incentives to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by\n\n modernizing the electric grid and supporting clean energy microgrids; increasing the use of renewable energy and advanced nuclear power technologies; increasing energy efficiency in buildings, homes, and appliances; supporting clean transportation, including electric vehicles and related charging infrastructure; issuing greenhouse gas standards for certain vehicles, engines, and aircraft; promoting manufacturing and industrial decarbonization, including through buy-clean programs; supporting environmental justice efforts; and reducing methane, plastics, and super pollutants."
