NOAA shall complete an assessment of access to NWR.\n\nNOAA shall enhance NWR to ensure its capabilities and coverage remain valuable to the public. In carrying out such activities, NOAA must prioritize practices, capabilities, and technologies recommended by the assessment to maximize accessibility, particularly in remote and underserved areas of the country."
