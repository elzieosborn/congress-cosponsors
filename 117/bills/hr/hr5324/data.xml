  <summary date="2022-05-16T18:25:42Z" status="Passed House">NOAA Weather Radio Modernization Act of 2021 or the NWR Modernization Act of 2021

This bill provides for the expansion of, and upgrades to, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio All Hazards network (NWR).

NOAA shall expand coverage of NWR and ensure its reliability by

 maintaining support for existing systems serving areas not covered by cellular service or having poor quality cellular service; ensuring consistent maintenance of, and timely repairs to, broadcast transmitter site equipment and antennas; and enhancing the ability to amplify Non-Weather Emergency Messages via NWR as necessary. NOAA shall complete an assessment of access to NWR.

NOAA shall enhance NWR to ensure its capabilities and coverage remain valuable to the public. In carrying out such activities, NOAA must prioritize practices, capabilities, and technologies recommended by the assessment to maximize accessibility, particularly in remote and underserved areas of the country.</summary>
