The bill also makes adjustments to the time limitation for using educational assistance under this program.\n\nThe VA must implement an information technology service using one or more commercial software systems to process claims for VA educational assistance benefits.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the Veterans' Employment and Training Service within the Department of Labor to implement a pilot program under which states may use grants or contracts to carry out a short-term fellowship program to provide veterans with opportunities for long-term employment."
