    "text": "FEMA Improvement, Reform, and Efficiency Act of 2021 or the FIRE Act\n\nThis bill addresses the federal government's approach to wildfires.\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes a public mitigation assistance applicant to relocate an eligible structure upon demonstrating that the structure is at risk from future damage and the relocation reduces the risk to the structure, is cost effective, and does not increase risk to adjacent structures.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in coordination with the National Weather Service, must conduct a study on Red Flag Warnings and similar weather and notification methods to implement plans and actions prior to a wildfire that can limit the impact, duration, or severity of the fire.\n\nThe President must ensure that those providing counseling or case management services to victims of a major disaster are trained to address cultural competency.\n\nFEMA must (1) conduct a study and develop a plan to address providing housing assistance to survivors of major disasters or emergencies when presented with challenges such as the lack of proof of ownership, and (2) seek to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study solutions to address the availability and affordability of insurance for wildfire perils and other related matters.\n\nThe bill allows Indian tribal governments to apply for grants for equipping, upgrading, and constructing state and local emergency operations centers."
