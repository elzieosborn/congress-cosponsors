This bill establishes an inspections regime for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).

 The Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General must conduct risk-based evaluations of BOP facilities.

An inspection of a facility may be announced or unannounced. Higher risk facilities must receive more frequent inspections.

The bill (1) provides for the establishment in DOJ of an Ombudsman who may receive complaints, make inquiries, and recommend actions, and decline to investigate or take action, as specified; and (2) prohibits retaliation against any person or entity that has instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding, investigation, or inspection.</summary>
