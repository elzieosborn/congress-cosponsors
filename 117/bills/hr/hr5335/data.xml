This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to develop and report on a plan to transfer all authorities, duties, functions, missions, personnel, units, facilities, and assets from the Space Force to the appropriate commands of the Armed Forces. As soon as practicable after such report is submitted and no later than one year after the enactment of this bill, DOD must abolish the Space Force as an armed force within the Department of the Air Force.

During the period preceding the abolishment of the Space Force, DOD is prohibited from transferring any authorities, duties, functions, missions, personnel, units, facilities, or assets from another armed force to the Space Force.

Any authorities, duties, functions, missions, personnel, units, facilities, and assets of the Space Force must be transferred to the Air Force Space Command (or other applicable command) upon the abolishment of the Space Force.</summary>
