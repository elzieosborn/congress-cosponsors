This bill directs the Department of Transportation to establish an Aerospace Supply Chain Resiliency Task Force to identify and assess risks to the U.S. aerospace supply chain and identify best practices and make recommendations to mitigate such risks.

The task force must convene for an initial meeting within 120 days after enactment of the bill and at least every 90 days thereafter. It must also report to Congress on the activities it carries out, including recommendations for regulatory, policy, or legislative action to improve government efforts to reduce barriers, mitigate risk, and bolster the resiliency of the U.S. aerospace supply chain.

The task force shall terminate upon submission of the report to Congress.</summary>
