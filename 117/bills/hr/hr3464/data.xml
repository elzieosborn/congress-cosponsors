  <summary date="2021-07-06T12:47:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Zero-Baseline Budget Act of 2021

This bill changes the assumptions that the Congressional Budget Office uses to calculate the baseline for discretionary spending. (A baseline is a projection of federal spending and receipts during a fiscal year under current law.)

The bill changes the assumptions used for the discretionary spending baseline to

 exclude emergency and supplemental spending; eliminate adjustments required under current law for inflation, expiring housing contracts, social insurance administrative expenses, pay adjustments, and changes to other personnel benefits; and prohibit other adjustments for inflation or any other factor.</summary>
