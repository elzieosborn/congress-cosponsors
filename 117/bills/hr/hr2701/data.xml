This bill provides funding for, and requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award, grants for demonstration projects to train low-income individuals to work in the field of pregnancy or childbirth. Grantees must be located in a state that recognizes doulas or midwives as health care providers and that allows payment for their services in the Medicaid program.</summary>
