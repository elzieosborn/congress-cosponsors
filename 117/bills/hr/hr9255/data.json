The bill also allows the foundation to locate its principal office outside of the District of Columbia and encourages the foundation to locate it in a coastal state.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires the foundation to develop best practices for conducting outreach to Indian tribes.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) may enter into other agreements, outside of contracts, under the Marine Debris Program. NOAA may also make in-kind contributions for projects under the program."
