This bill authorizes foreign vessels that carry more than 1,000 passengers (e.g., cruise ships) to transport passengers between a port in Alaska and another U.S. port, either directly or by way of a foreign port. The authorization generally expires 270 days after a notification that a U.S. vessel offers the same transport.</summary>
