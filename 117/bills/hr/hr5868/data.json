The assets, contracts, property, unexpended balances and records held by the Selective Service System must be transferred to the Office of Selective Service Records (reestablished by this bill) upon the repeal.\n\nThe bill prohibits the reenactment of the Military Selective Service Act or reestablishment of the Selective Service System unless there is a vote by two-thirds of each chamber of Congress."
