If revisions are needed, the office must consider the effect a revision would have on (1) the future capability and employment needs to support current and emerging warfighting concepts, (2) advanced systems and technologies available in the current commercial marketplace, (3) the rapid fielding of UAS technology, and (4) the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System."
