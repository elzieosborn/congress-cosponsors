This bill makes various changes related to the regulation and operation of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which provides low-cost electricity in seven southeastern states. For example, the bill (1) eliminates certain restrictions on the sale of power into and out of the Tennessee Valley, and (2) expands the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's oversight of rates and other aspects of the TVA's operations.</summary>
