This bill expands coverage of telehealth services under Medicare. Specifically, the bill permanently removes geographic restrictions on originating sites (i.e., the location of the beneficiary). It also permanently expands coverage to include audio-only services for evaluation and management and behavioral health services; beneficiaries must have received in-person or video services during the preceding three-year period.</summary>
