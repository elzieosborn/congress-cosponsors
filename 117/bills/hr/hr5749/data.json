    "text": "Gas Consumer Emergency Market Protection Act\n\nThis bill restricts natural gas trading during certain federal emergencies. Specifically, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission must require by rule that natural gas trading facilities impose limits to prevent market distortions in the spot market (i.e., commodities traded for immediate delivery) and the day-ahead market during such a period. Persons who violate this rule may be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1 million per day.\n\nAdditionally, the commission must study who benefitted from natural gas price increases associated with Winter Storm Uri."
