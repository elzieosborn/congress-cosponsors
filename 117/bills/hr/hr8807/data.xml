This bill eliminates the Department of State's repatriation loan program.&#160; The program currently authorizes the State Department to loan funds to private U.S. citizens and third-country nationals for emergency evacuation from foreign countries where their lives are endangered by war, civil unrest, or natural disasters, rather than expending appropriated funds.</summary>
