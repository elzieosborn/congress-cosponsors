This bill requires the military branches to pay the expenses to deliver the personal effects of a deceased service member (including the reserve components) to the next of kin or other appropriate person.

In situations where a military branch has entered into an agreement with an entity to carry out such deliveries, the branch concerned must pursue a claim against the entity when it fails to carry out any delivery. The branch must also reimburse the next of kin or other appropriate person if the entity fails to make a delivery because of the loss or destruction of the personal effects.</summary>
