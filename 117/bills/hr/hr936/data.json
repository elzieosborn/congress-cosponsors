Specifically, FEMA must\n\n manage vaccine deliveries, set up vaccination centers, design communication systems and software applications, and develop a public education program on vaccine safety and availability. Additionally, HHS must carry out a program to increase vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity. As part of this program, HHS must temporarily collect data on COVID-19 vaccine administrations. Data collected under this program is subject to relevant privacy protections that apply to other health data. HHS must report on its activities on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nThe CDC must also report on the effectiveness of state and local COVID-19 vaccination programs."
