The VA must monitor the plan to address any deficiencies.\n\nThe VBA must annually compile a list of common recurring deficiencies and action items relating to disability compensation identified in its ongoing reviews of the functions of each of its principal organizational elements. Additionally, the VBA must develop and carry out a plan to address the recurring deficiencies and action items.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must conduct a feasibility study of the VA entering a contract with a nongovernmental entity to carry out the quality assurance program in the VBA."
