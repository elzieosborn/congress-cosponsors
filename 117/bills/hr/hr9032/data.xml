This bill establishes annual discretionary spending limits for FY2023-FY2032.

The bill also establishes a budget point of order that may be raised against legislation that prevents a sequestration order from taking effect, such as legislation that suspends or waives an order. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)</summary>
