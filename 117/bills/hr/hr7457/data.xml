This bill imposes certain restrictions related to China.

For example, the bill (1) generally prohibits investments in certain Chinese military companies and entities reasonably believed to be involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests; (2) withdraws normal trade relations treatment from China and expands the bases of ineligibility for this treatment to include specified human rights violations by China; and (3) requires the Department of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive directors at certain multilateral development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, to oppose providing a loan, financial assistance, or technical assistance to China.</summary>
