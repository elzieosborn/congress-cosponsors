This bill authorizes funding for FY2021 to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), continues U.S. use of the International Space Station (ISS) through FY2030, and authorizes programs and activities.

Among other requirements, NASA must

 maintain competitiveness within the human landing system program by funding no fewer than two entities, establish a plan for the manufacture of advanced spacesuits, establish a low-Earth orbit commercial development program to encourage commercial use and development of space by private entities in the United States, and update and improve the cybersecurity of NASA space assets and supporting infrastructure and maintain a Security Operations Center to respond to cybersecurity threats to NASA information technology systems. Additionally, the bill authorizes NASA to maintain two operational mobile launch platforms to enable multiple configurations of the Space Launch System and conduct missions to intermediate destinations, such as the Moon, in order to achieve human exploration of Mars.

Further, the Department of Defense must review each of its planned, ongoing, and completed activities, programs, and projects on the ISS.

The bill also (1) limits cooperation by NASA with China, and (2) provides for a designated invention to be the exclusive property of a user under specified conditions.</summary>
