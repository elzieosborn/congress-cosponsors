Additionally, the bill authorizes NASA to maintain two operational mobile launch platforms to enable multiple configurations of the Space Launch System and conduct missions to intermediate destinations, such as the Moon, in order to achieve human exploration of Mars.\n\nFurther, the Department of Defense must review each of its planned, ongoing, and completed activities, programs, and projects on the ISS.\n\nThe bill also (1) limits cooperation by NASA with China, and (2) provides for a designated invention to be the exclusive property of a user under specified conditions."
