  <summary date="2022-07-18T19:03:52Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the President to impose sanctions for human rights abuses and actions to undermine democracy in Sudan.

Specifically, the President must impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on any individual or entity that is responsible for, complicit in, or engaged (or attempted to engage) in various actions, including actions that (1) undermine the transition to democracy in Sudan; (2) threaten Sudan's peace, security, or stability; (3) constitute gross violations of human rights in Sudan; (4) result in the misappropriation of Sudan's state assets; or (5) disrupt access to communications or the internet in Sudan. The sanctions shall also apply to entities affiliated with such sanctioned individuals and entities, including entities formed for the purpose of evading the sanctions.</summary>
