  <summary date="2022-05-13T14:05:20Z" status="Passed House">Protecting Semiconductor Supply Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act

This bill establishes an interagency working group to address semiconductor supply chain issues caused by Russia's attack on Ukraine.

The working group must report to Congress on issues including (1) the impact of Russia's attack on Ukraine on the supply of various materials, including palladium, neon gas, and helium; (2) the attack's impact on supply chains and the global economy; and (3) recommendations for legislative steps that Congress can take to further bolster the supply of materials for the semiconductor supply chain that have been curtailed by Russia's actions.

The working group must also report annually to Congress on future geopolitical developments that could severely disrupt global semiconductor supply chains in ways that could harm the United States.</summary>
