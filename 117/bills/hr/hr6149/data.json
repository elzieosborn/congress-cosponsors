HRSA must also award grants for (1) using the abilities of direct care workers to manage and improve the health of individuals with multiple chronic conditions and long-term care needs; or (2) training direct care workers to take on greater responsibilities in managing specific diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and diabetes."
