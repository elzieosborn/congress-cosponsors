  <summary date="2021-03-24T19:29:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Essential Worker Pandemic Compensation Act of 2021

This bill compensates specified essential workers who die or are hospitalized as a result of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) or related complications.

Specifically, the bill provides death benefits to survivors of essential workers equal to the amount available under the public safety officer benefits program. Essential workers include those identified in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency guidance or by a Special Master appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Such death benefits include additional payments to a surviving spouse or child enrolled in qualified postsecondary education.

Further, essential workers who are hospitalized as a result of COVID-19 receive one half of the base death benefit amount.</summary>
