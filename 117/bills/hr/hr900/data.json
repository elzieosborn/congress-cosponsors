Essential workers include those identified in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency guidance or by a Special Master appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Such death benefits include additional payments to a surviving spouse or child enrolled in qualified postsecondary education.\n\nFurther, essential workers who are hospitalized as a result of COVID-19 receive one half of the base death benefit amount."
