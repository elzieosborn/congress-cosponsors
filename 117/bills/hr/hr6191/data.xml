  <summary date="2021-12-09T18:47:58Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides continuing appropriations to the District of Columbia courts and related agencies during any fiscal year in which appropriations have not otherwise been provided. (The continuing appropriations would exempt the courts and agencies from a government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations for the federal government.)

The bill provides continuing appropriations for federal payments to

 the District of Columbia Courts, defender services in District of Columbia courts, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia Public Defender Service, the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the District of Columbia Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure, and the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission.</summary>
