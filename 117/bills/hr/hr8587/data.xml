This bill revises the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to require state agencies that use a competitive bidding system for infant formula contracts to award such contracts to at least two manufacturers. Additionally, it prohibits states from contracting more than 70% of their WIC infant formula from one manufacturer within a year.</summary>
