The CBP must also develop standard operating procedures for a workforce tracking system, train the workforce on the use of such system, and implement internal controls to ensure timely and accurate scheduling and reporting.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must review the model and provide feedback regarding the degree to which it is responsive to certain DHS recommendations."
