In providing grants, priority must be given to states and Indian tribes that already have an established program to carry out such activities.\n\nFinally, the Department of Energy must provide technical assistance to oil and gas producing states and Indian tribes to ensure practical and economical remedies for environmental problems caused by orphaned or abandoned oil and gas well sites on state, tribal, or private land."
