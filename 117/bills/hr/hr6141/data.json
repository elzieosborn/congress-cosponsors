    "text": "This bill addresses the land settlement agreement between the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe in Arizona. Among other things, the bill requires the Department of the Interior to study the impacts of relocation and federal development freezes (commonly known as the Bennett Freeze), allows the Navajo Nation to select an additional 757 acres of land, and expands the authority of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation to carry out a rehabilitation program to redress the effects of the Bennett Freeze.\n\nThe Bennett Freeze was issued administratively in 1966 by former Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Robert Bennett to restrict the Navajo Nation from constructing and repairing their dwellings on land subject to a land dispute with the Hopi Tribe."
