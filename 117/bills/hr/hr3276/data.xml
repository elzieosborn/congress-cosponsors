This bill eliminates specified disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies. Specifically, these companies are no longer required to publicly disclose the ratio of median annual employee compensation to the annual compensation of the chief executive officer.

In addition, these companies are not required to report on the use of conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (Conflict minerals directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in specified areas.)

Finally, the bill eliminates the requirement that companies that extract resources must annually report on payments made by the company to a foreign government or the federal government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals.</summary>
