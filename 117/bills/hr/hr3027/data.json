The bill requires the VA Office of Inspector General to review the administration of such website annually instead of the current semiannual requirement.\n\nThe VA must implement a two-year pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of expediting the Veterans Health Administration's onboarding process for new medical providers.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the VA to submit a strategy to reduce by half the duration of the VA's hiring process for licensed professional medical providers."
