  <summary date="2023-01-18T14:05:38Z" status="Reported to House, Part I">Illegal Fishing and Forced Labor Prevention Act

This bill sets forth and revises federal law concerning activities to combat human trafficking and illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing in the seafood industry.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shall expand the Seafood Import Monitoring Program to apply to all seafood and seafood products imported into the United States.

The Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, Labor, and Health and Human Services must jointly execute a memorandum of understanding to codify and improve interagency cooperation on seafood safety, preventing illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing and human trafficking, including forced labor, and seafood fraud prevention, enforcement, and inspections.

NOAA shall engage with each flag, coastal, port, and market nation that exports seafood to the United States to collect information sufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of such nation's management of fisheries and control systems to prevent illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing.</summary>
