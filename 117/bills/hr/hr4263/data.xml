This bill allows certain off-campus departments of providers to be included in the Medicare prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services. Providers must attest that the department was previously considered on-campus or otherwise met applicable requirements, but is now off-campus due to the provider's forced relocation to meet patient needs.</summary>
