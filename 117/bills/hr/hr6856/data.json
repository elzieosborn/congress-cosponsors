It also makes individuals who violate the prohibitions ineligible for programs that expedite security screenings at airports.\n\nAdditionally, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) must display signage and carry out a campaign to inform travelers of the prohibitions and of the penalties for violating them.\n\nThe bill also requires the TSA and the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress about the bill's implementation and related issues."
