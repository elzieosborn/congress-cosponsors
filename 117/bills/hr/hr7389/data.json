(Value-based purchasing arrangements refer to arrangements in which the price of a drug is linked to clinical outcomes; such arrangements are particularly used for new high-cost treatments, such as gene therapies.)\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must study the impact of value-based purchasing arrangements on federal health care programs, including with respect to the bill's changes."
