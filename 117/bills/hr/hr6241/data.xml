  <summary date="2021-12-20T11:43:08Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill allows penalty-free distributions from tax-exempt retirement plans for a federally declared disaster (i.e., a qualified disaster recovery distribution). The bill defines qualified disaster recovery distribution as any distribution within a 180 day period after a disaster declaration that is made to an individual whose principal residence is located in a qualified disaster area (an area for which a major disaster has been declared) and who has sustained an economic loss due to the disaster.

The bill sets forth rules for the recontribution of withdrawals from a plan for first-time home purchases or for purchases or construction of a principal residence in a disaster area, and increases the limit on loans from a qualified employer plan that an individual may take in lieu of a distribution.</summary>
