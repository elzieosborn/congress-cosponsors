    "text": "COVID-19 Supply Chain Relief Act\n\nThis bill establishes in the Executive Office of the President an Office of Supply Chain Policy, headed by a Supply Chain Czar appointed by the President.\n\nSuch office shall\n\n coordinate a national response to supply chain disruptions, shortages, and increased prices; serve as a resource for states as they deploy unused COVID-19 relief funds to address supply chain bottlenecks; and appoint, oversee, and coordinate among regional supply chain leaders. Unobligated COVID-19 relief funds may be made available to states, territories, or tribal governments to help address supply chain disruptions and labor shortages by undertaking one or more of the following:\n\n promoting employment in the trucking and logistics industries, implementing apprenticeship programs to recruit more women and military veterans to become licensed commercial motor vehicle drivers, undertaking port and shipping infrastructure projects, and providing relief from other detrimental economic impacts of supply chain disruptions. The Department of Commerce must issue guidance, as needed, to define the scope of the allowable activities listed above.\n\nFurther, Commerce shall publish and submit to Congress a report on (1) supply chain points of congestion or blockages; (2) underlying causes of supply chain disruptions, shortages, and delays; and (3) other supply chain shortcomings which could be remedied with public or private investment."
