This bill directs the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to report annually to Congress and the public on health care fraud that targets seniors.

Specifically, the report must include (1) the 10 most prevalent&#160;health care fraud schemes targeted to seniors, (2)&#160;steps being taken to combat such schemes,&#160;and (3) policy suggestions to improve protections for seniors. The report may omit information or details that would compromise an ongoing investigation or would serve criminals rather than seniors.

The report must be posted on certain agency websites and disseminated to Medicare beneficiaries, as specified.</summary>
