This bill prohibits the federal government from using reverse auctions for complex, specialized, or substantial design and construction services. Reverse auctions allow the sellers to bid down the price of a project and typically result in the contractor with the lowest bid winning the contract.

The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council must define complex, specialized, or substantial design and construction services.

The General Services Administration shall report to specified congressional committees on this bill's effectiveness.</summary>
