A credit reporting agency is also prohibited from reporting certain adverse credit information related to financial abuse, unfair or fraudulent mortgage lending, or fraudulent private student lending.\n\nThe bill extends the time credit reporting agencies have to place a credit security freeze when receiving such a request by phone or through electronic means from one to three business days. It also extends the time agencies have to remove a freeze from one hour to three days."
