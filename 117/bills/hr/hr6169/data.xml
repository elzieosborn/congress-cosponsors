  <summary date="2022-02-14T20:18:06Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a framework to consolidate the information regarding risks to the defense supply chain to enable department-wide risk assessments and support the development of strategies to mitigate such risks.

The framework required by the bill may be included as a part of the framework developed pursuant to recommendations provided under section five of Executive Order 14017 (86 Fed. Reg. 11849), which relates to U.S. supply chains.

After the framework is established, DOD must regularly issue guidance on mitigating risks to the defense supply chain.</summary>
