This bill modifies provisions relating to the licensing of commercial remote sensing systems.

The bill decreases from 120 to 60 days the amount of time in which the Department of Commerce shall review and make a determination on the application for a license by a private sector party to operate a private remote sensing space system.

The annual report concerning the licensing of private remote sensing systems must include (1) a list of all applications submitted and licenses granted, listed by tier, as well as the rationale for each tier categorization; and (2) all terms, conditions, or restrictions placed on licensees.</summary>
