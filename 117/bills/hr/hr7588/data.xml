This bill excludes certain arrangements or agreements regarding education loans from the definition of a preferred lender arrangement.

A preferred lender arrangement is an arrangement or agreement between a lender and an institution of higher education (IHE) that receives federal funding or assistance (1) under which a lender issues education loans to students attending the IHE; and (2) that relates to the IHE recommending, promoting, or endorsing the education loan products of the lender.

The bill provides that arrangements or agreements made under a state-based education loan program or that are funded, insured, or guaranteed by any federal agency other than the Department of Education do not meet the definition of a preferred lender agreement for purposes of certain required disclosures to student borrowers.</summary>
