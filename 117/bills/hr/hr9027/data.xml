This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a pilot program for the research and development of ocean replenishment and restoration technologies and techniques that have the potential to achieve regional-to-global scale ocean restoration, enhancement of fisheries, conservation of marine mammals, and emissions reductions.

DOE shall prioritize activities that take place in pelagic waters and will not stimulate phytoplankton production that causes or accelerates harmful algal blooms in coastal waters. Pelagic waters means the part of the open sea or ocean other than coastal waters.</summary>
