  <summary date="2021-05-27T20:50:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Report and Educate About Campus Hazing Act or the REACH Act

This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student-aid programs to report hazing incidents and distribute policies on hazing.

Specifically, the bill requires each IHE to disclose hazing incidents that were reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies in its annual security report. The bill defines the term hazing to mean any intentional, knowing, or reckless act committed by a student, or a former student, of an IHE against another student (regardless of that student's willingness to participate), that (1) is connected&#160;with an initiation into, an affiliation with, or the maintenance of membership in an organization that is affiliated with the IHE (e.g., an athletic team); and (2) contributes to a substantial risk of physical injury, mental harm, or degradation or causes physical injury, mental harm, or personal degradation.

In addition, each IHE must distribute to enrolled and prospective students its policies on hazing, including information on education programs that promote hazing awareness.</summary>
