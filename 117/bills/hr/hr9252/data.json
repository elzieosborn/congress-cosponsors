Specifically, it makes such transfers automatic, subject to the right of employees to opt out. It imposes certain requirements upon an automatic portability provider, including a requirement that the provider acknowledge its fiduciary status and provide a notice in advance to an employee whose retirement account is being transferred that contains a description of the automatic portability transaction and any fees charged in connection with the transaction.\n\nThis bill also allows an eligible employer a $500 tax credit in the year that an automatic portability arrangement is adopted."
