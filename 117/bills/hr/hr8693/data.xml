  <summary date="2022-10-13T00:14:14Z" status="Introduced in House">No Cost for Monkeypox Testing Act of 2022 This bill requires specified public health care programs and private health insurance to cover, through December 31, 2023, testing for monkeypox without imposing cost-sharing, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. (Monkeypox is a viral disease that is endemic to parts of Africa and causes symptoms similar to, but less severe than, smallpox.)

The bill also establishes procedures for uninsured individuals to access such testing at no cost.</summary>
