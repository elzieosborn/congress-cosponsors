  <summary date="2021-09-15T14:01:39Z" status="Introduced in House">Afghanistan Accountability Act

This bill requires the President to impose sanctions on certain foreign persons, such as Taliban officials, and requires reports related to Afghanistan.

The President must impose asset- and visa-blocking sanctions on any foreign person who (1) is an official, agent, or instrumentality of the Taliban; (2) has acted to undermine democratic institutions or threaten the stability of Afghanistan; (3) has acted to limit or penalize freedom of expression in Afghanistan, particularly the freedom of expression of women; (4) has committed serious human rights abuses in Afghanistan; or (5) operates in the mining sector in Afghanistan. The sanctions also apply to certain immediate relatives of such persons and those who provide material support to such persons.

The bill also requires reports to Congress on (1) the intelligence provided to the President and policymakers prior to and concerning the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, (2) whether the Taliban meets the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization, and (3) human rights violations by the Taliban against individuals who supported U.S. efforts in Afghanistan.</summary>
