The sanctions also apply to certain immediate relatives of such persons and those who provide material support to such persons.\n\nThe bill also requires reports to Congress on (1) the intelligence provided to the President and policymakers prior to and concerning the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, (2) whether the Taliban meets the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization, and (3) human rights violations by the Taliban against individuals who supported U.S. efforts in Afghanistan."
