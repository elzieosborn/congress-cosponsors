  <summary date="2022-03-03T20:33:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Blocking Joseph Robinette Biden's Overreaching Vaccine Mandates Act

This bill restricts implementation and enforcement of COVID-19 vaccine mandates, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services may not require, as a condition of participation in the programs, that providers mandate COVID-19 vaccination for their employees, or otherwise penalize participating providers that do not mandate such vaccination.

The bill also prohibits the use of federal funds to implement or enforce a COVID-19 vaccine mandate.</summary>
