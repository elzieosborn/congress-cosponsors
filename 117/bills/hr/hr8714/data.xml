This bill modifies the actions that the Department of State must take with regards to a foreign country that refuses to accept a citizen or national of that country who is subject to a final order of removal from the United States.

Currently, the State Department must discontinue granting immigration visas, nonimmigrant visas, or both, to citizens or nationals of that country until the country has accepted the individual subject to removal. Under this bill, the State Department must discontinue granting both types of visas until the country accepts the individual.</summary>
