Zero-waste means the conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse, and recovery of products, packaging, and materials without (1) burning or otherwise destroying embodied energy; and (2) a discharge to land, water, or air that results in adverse human health or environmental effects.\n\nIn addition, the EPA must establish a program to award grants for developing and implementing new requirements that reduce the amount of waste disposed of in landfills."
