This bill requires the Department of State to address the use of untrusted telecommunications equipment (and services). It also requires certain securities issuers to disclose the use of such equipment.

The State Department must provide support, such as diplomatic and political support, for certain telecommunications infrastructure projects that have the potential to promote U.S. national security interests.

Furthermore, a securities issuer that is required to file annual or quarterly reports with the Securities Exchange Commission must periodically disclose whether it used or contracted to use telecommunications equipment deemed by the Federal Communications Commission to pose an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security or the security and safety of U.S. persons. The disclosure must contain certain information, including whether the equipment is being used in a mobile network run by the issuer.

The State Department must report to Congress on (1) the prevalence of such telecommunications equipment in the networks of U.S. allies and partners, and (2) the use of such telecommunications equipment in U.S. embassies and by embassy staff and personnel.</summary>
