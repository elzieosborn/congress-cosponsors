  <summary date="2023-07-31T22:09:26Z" status="Reported to Senate">Computers for Veterans and Students Act of 2022 or the COVS Act

This bill requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to transfer certain surplus computers and technology equipment to nonprofit computer refurbishers for repair and eventual distribution to schools (including home schools), veterans, seniors, and other specified populations in need.

Specifically, not later than 30 days after the GSA provides state agencies for surplus property an opportunity to review surplus computer or technology equipment that has been determined to be repairable, the GSA must transfer such equipment to participating nonprofit computer refurbishers for repair, distribution, and subsequent transfer to eligible recipients.</summary>
