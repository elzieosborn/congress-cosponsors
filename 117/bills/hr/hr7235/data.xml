  <summary date="2022-07-14T19:39:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant Act of 2022

This bill reauthorizes through FY2027 and modifies the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, which supports state, tribal, and territorial efforts to prevent and treat substance use disorders.

Specifically, the bill expands the scope of the grant to include the provision of recovery support services. Grant recipients must include information about recovery support activities in their plans for expending grant funds.

Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must conduct a study to develop a model needs assessment process for grant recipients to use when determining the allocation of grant funding among prevention, treatment, and recovery support activities.

The bill also revises multiple provisions to eliminate stigmatizing terms (e.g., substance abuse) and otherwise align with current legislative drafting conventions.</summary>
