This bill establishes licensing requirements for law enforcement officers.

The Department of Justice must issue licensing standards based on law enforcement best practices.

Federal law enforcement officers must be licensed in accordance with such standards and take continuing education classes to maintain their license.

States must have in effect a similar licensing system and continuing education program to receive a full allocation of funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program.</summary>
