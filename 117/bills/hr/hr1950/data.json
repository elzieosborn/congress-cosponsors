Such retirement payments are those made under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System based on the individual's service as a Member.\n\nUnder current law, a Member must forgo receipt of these payments only after a final conviction (i.e., after the exhaustion of all appeals under the judicial process). The bill eliminates these payments to a Member from the date of sentencing for the conviction."
