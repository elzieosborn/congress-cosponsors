The bill also rescinds orders establishing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) programs. (Generally, DACA defers the deportation of eligible aliens who entered the United States as minors, while DAPA is a similar program for the alien parents of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.)"
