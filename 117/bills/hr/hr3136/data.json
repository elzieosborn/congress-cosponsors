Under current law, an IHE must disclose to ED a gift or contract from a foreign source that is valued at $250,000 or more, considered alone or in combination with all other gifts from or contracts with that foreign source within a calendar year.\n\n An IHE must also report the identity of each foreign source and the name of each foreign government.\n\nFurther, an IHE must report additional information when it receives a restricted or conditional gift or contract from a foreign source. Such additional information includes (1) the identity of the foreign source; (2) the identity of the specific department, college, project, or other division of the IHE that is the recipient of the gift or contract, if applicable; and (3) the intended purpose of the gift or contract."
