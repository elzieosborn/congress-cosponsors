This bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to undertake rulemaking to adopt policies and procedures for maintaining the independence of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) and enhancing their responsiveness to customers and stakeholders. (RTOs and ISOs manage the generation and transmission components of the electric grid in areas with a competitive market for wholesale electric power.)</summary>
