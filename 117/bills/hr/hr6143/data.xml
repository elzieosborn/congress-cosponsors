This bill makes several budgetary and technical changes in relation to Medicare.

Specifically, the bill continues to exempt Medicare from sequestration until March 31, 2022. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)

The bill also temporarily extends other provisions under Medicare, including a payment increase under the physician fee schedule.</summary>
