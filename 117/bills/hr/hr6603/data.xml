This bill&#160;modifies requirements&#160;related to federal&#160;education funding for disadvantaged children. Specifically, the bill (1)&#160;eliminates the standards, assessments, and academic accountability requirements for state and local educational agencies that receive federal funds for the education of disadvantaged children; (2) requires such funds to be allocated based on the number of children residing in each state who are living in poverty; and (3) allows educational agencies to distribute per-pupil amounts from such funds to parents for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses.

The bill prohibits federal officers or employees from mandating academic standards, assessments, curricula, or accountability systems.</summary>
