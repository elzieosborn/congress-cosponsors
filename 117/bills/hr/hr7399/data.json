The bill requires the advisory board to meet at least twice each year.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture (USDA) shall charge (currently may charge) reasonable fees, as determined by the advisory board, for admission to and the use of the designated sites, or for activities, within the recreation area.\n\nThe bill states that amounts in the fund shall be available to USDA to perform new work or deferred maintenance in the recreation area and shall not be available for the payment of salaries or other expenses.\n\nUSDA, on request from a qualified resident or relative or a cemetery association, shall grant additional land for the expansion of existing cemeteries within the recreation area to allow for the burial of qualified residents or relatives."
