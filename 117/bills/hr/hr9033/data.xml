  <summary date="2022-12-05T11:59:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act or the SHORT Act

This bill removes certain short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns, and other weapons from the definition of a firearm for purposes of regulation under the National Firearms Act (NFA).

The bill also eliminates certain restrictions that apply to the sale or transportation of such rifles and shotguns in interstate commerce.

If a state or local registration or licensing requirement is determined by reference to the NFA, the bill treats persons who acquire or possess a short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, or other weapon in accordance with the Gun Control Act of 1968 as meeting the registration and licensing requirements.

The bill preempts certain state or local laws that tax or regulate these rifles and shotguns.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives must destroy records relating to the registration, transfer, or manufacture of applicable weapons described by this bill within one year after the enactment of this bill.</summary>
