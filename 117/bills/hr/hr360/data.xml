This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to automate the collection of outstanding, overdue, and incomplete payments of third-party health insurance claims, regardless of the amount owed under any single claim. The VA must seek to enter a contract using competitive procedures and select a contractor that has proven expertise in the private sector through the use of automated small-balance recovery and appeal processes.</summary>
