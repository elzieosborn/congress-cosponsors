This bill withholds the salaries of senior government officials and restricts the use of federal funds for official travel by senior government officials if all of the regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year have not been enacted by the first day of the fiscal year.

Under the bill, senior government officials include

 a Member of Congress; the President; the Vice President; the head of any executive department; and any employee of, or detailee to, the Executive Office of the President whose annual rate of basic pay is at least $158,000. If a chamber of Congress has not approved all of the annual appropriations bills for a fiscal year by the first day of the fiscal year, the bill prohibits the chamber from adjourning for a period of more than 12 hours until it has approved the bills.

The bill also provides continuing appropriations to prevent a government shutdown if any appropriations measure for a fiscal year has not been enacted before the fiscal year begins or a joint resolution making continuing appropriations is not in effect.

For an initial 30-day period, the bill provides appropriations to continue programs, projects, and activities for which funds were provided in the preceding fiscal year. The bill reduces the continuing appropriations by 2.5% after the first 30-day period and by an additional 2.5% for each subsequent 30-day period until the applicable appropriations legislation is enacted.</summary>
