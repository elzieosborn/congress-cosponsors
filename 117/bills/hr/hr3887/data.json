In addition, the President may also terminate the sanctions if it is in U.S. national security interests. The President must notify Congress at least 15 days before terminating the sanctions.\n\nThe President must annually report to Congress on the imposition and termination of sanctions on foreign persons for engaging in public corruption.\n\nThe authority to impose the sanctions terminates six years after this bill's enactment."
