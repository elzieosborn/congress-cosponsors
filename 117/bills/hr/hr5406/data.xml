This bill requires specified federal departments, including the Central Intelligence Agency, to jointly develop and submit to Congress a plan for an interagency biodefense task force to support and inform decision-making based on biological attribution (i.e., determining the source) of emerging and new diseases or other biological events.

The plan must outline the duties of the task force, set out the roles of member agencies, describe the contribution of the task force to national biodefense strategies and plans, and address related matters.

The bill requires the establishment of the task force not later than 90 days following the submission of the plan.</summary>
