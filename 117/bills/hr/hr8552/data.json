The bill sets forth provisions regarding background checks of coaches, mentors, and other adults with access to youth sports participants.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may establish a program to award grants to municipalities, counties, and states to fund efforts to establish and implement model standards, such as through surveys, studies, pilot programs, and guidelines, for out-of-school youth sports coaches.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office and HHS must report to Congress regarding youth sports.\n\nThe bill authorizes the CDC and the National Institutes of Health to undertake, support, enhance, and expand research and prevention efforts to advance youth sports safety."
