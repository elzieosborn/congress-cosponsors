Specifically, the program is for veterans or members of the Armed Forces who are eligible for VA housing or small business loans and have insufficient credit history.\n\nUnder the program, the VA must assess the feasibility and advisability of establishing criteria for acceptable commercially available credit scoring models to be used by lenders for the purpose of guaranteeing or insuring a VA housing or small business loan.\n\nParticipation is voluntary on an opt-in basis for lenders, borrowers, and individuals.\n\nThe VA must conduct outreach to lenders and individuals to inform them of the pilot program."
