  <summary date="2021-02-19T22:07:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Direct Support for Communities Act

This bill provides FY2021 supplemental appropriations to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to award additional Community Development Block Grants to units of local government and counties to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus and the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.

Specifically, within 30 days, HUD must distribute 50% of such funds to metropolitan cities and other units of local government and 50% to counties and parishes. These funds may be used to cover costs or replace lost, delayed, or decreased revenues stemming from the COVID-19 public health emergency.

Additionally, the bill designates the funding as emergency spending, which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.</summary>
