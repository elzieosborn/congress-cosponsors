This bill directs certain actions to allow federal officers and employees to bring dogs into the United States from countries that are considered high-risk for rabies. Among other provisions, the bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to allow federal officers and employees who are stationed abroad, including members of the military, to bring up to three dogs into the United States per entry; the CDC may allow for more dogs through specialized waivers.</summary>
