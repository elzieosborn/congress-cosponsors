Additionally, with respect to the executive branch, the bill\n\n requires agencies to publicly disclose additional information relating to sponsored advertisements, budget requests, and grant recipients; requires certain legal advisory opinions and rulemaking materials to be published within specified time frames; and provides for the appointment of a special counsel to prosecute individuals in the executive branch for contempt of Congress. Finally, with respect to the judicial branch, the bill\n\n requires the Supreme Court to allow proceedings that are conducted in open court to be televised, requires certain financial disclosure statements of judicial officers to be posted within specified time frames, and requires certain electronic filing systems to be consolidated and meet certain data standards (e.g., search functions)."
