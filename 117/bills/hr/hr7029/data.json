The statute generally prohibits making facilities available for the purpose of unlawfully using a controlled substance.\n\nThe bill provides an exception for federal funds awarded through the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program or the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program. Specifically, federal funds awarded through the COPS grant program or the JAG grant program shall remain available to a state, local, tribal, or other entity that operates or controls an injection center in violation of the Crack House Statute."
