  <summary date="2022-06-22T19:42:40Z" status="Public Law">Modernizing Access to our Public Land Act or the MAPLand Act

This bill directs the Department of the Interior, the Forest Service, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to jointly develop and adopt interagency standards to ensure compatibility and interoperability among federal databases for the collection and dissemination of outdoor recreation data related to federal lands and used to depict locations at which recreation uses are available to the public.

Interior, the Forest Service, and the Corps of Engineers must digitize and publish geographic information system data that includes

 federal interests, including easements and rights-of-way, in private land; status information as to whether roads and trails are open or closed; the dates on which roads and trails are seasonally opened and closed; the types of vehicles and recreational uses that are allowed on each segment of roads and trails; and the boundaries of areas where hunting or recreational shooting is permanently restricted or closed. Interior, the Forest Service, and the Corps of Engineers may work with the U.S. Geological Survey to collect, digitize, standardize, or publish data to meet the requirements of this bill.</summary>
