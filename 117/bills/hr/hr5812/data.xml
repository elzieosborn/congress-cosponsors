  <summary date="2022-10-07T11:52:40Z" status="Introduced in House">National Patient ID Repeal Act

This bill repeals the requirement that the Department of Health and Human Services adopt a standard unique health identifier for each individual, employer, health plan, and health care provider.

The provision has not been implemented to date because language included in annual appropriations acts has prohibited the use of federal funds for developing a unique identifier. However, some appropriations bills introduced in recent years have not included this funding restriction.</summary>
