It also makes certain TANF provisions, including those related to child support enforcement and mandatory work requirements, inapplicable to that territory.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Health and Human Services must\n\n provide technical assistance to the CNMI on developing a plan to use its TANF funds; and seek to negotiate an agreement with the CNMI that sets out how the territory's work, employment, and training programs will be assessed."
