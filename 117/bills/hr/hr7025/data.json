The prohibition against providing funding to such a unit shall not apply if the applicable government is taking effective steps to (1) bring the responsible members of the unit to justice, and (2) prevent gross violations of internationally recognized human rights by the unit in the future.\n\nThe USFWS must take other actions to prevent funding such a unit, such as (1) coordinating with the Department of State on procedures for vetting potential assistance recipients, (2) publicly identifying units that are barred from receiving assistance, (3) requiring assistance recipients to provide certain information and to implement a safeguards plan, and (4) requiring periodic financial and programmatic audits of assistance recipients.\n\nThe bill also requires (1) a grant recipient to report credible information about possible human rights violations involving a grant to the USFWS and the relevant diplomatic or consular post, (2) the program awarding the grant to investigate such allegations, and (3) the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior to investigate certain cases referred by the USFWS."
