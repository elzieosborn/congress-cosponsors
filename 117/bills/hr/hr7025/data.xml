  <summary date="2022-07-26T12:33:27Z" status="Passed House">Advancing Human Rights-Centered International Conservation Act of 2022

This bill requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to take actions to ensure that the international financial assistance it provides does not go to any foreign security force unit (e.g., a military or paramilitary unit) where there is a reasonable belief that the unit has committed a gross violation of internationally recognized human rights.

The USFWS must conduct risk analysis to ensure that a recipient (or subrecipient) of a grant does not fund or support any such unit. The prohibition against providing funding to such a unit shall not apply if the applicable government is taking effective steps to (1) bring the responsible members of the unit to justice, and (2) prevent gross violations of internationally recognized human rights by the unit in the future.

The USFWS must take other actions to prevent funding such a unit, such as (1) coordinating with the Department of State on procedures for vetting potential assistance recipients, (2) publicly identifying units that are barred from receiving assistance, (3) requiring assistance recipients to provide certain information and to implement a safeguards plan, and (4) requiring periodic financial and programmatic audits of assistance recipients.

The bill also requires (1) a grant recipient to report credible information about possible human rights violations involving a grant to the USFWS and the relevant diplomatic or consular post, (2) the program awarding the grant to investigate such allegations, and (3) the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior to investigate certain cases referred by the USFWS.</summary>
