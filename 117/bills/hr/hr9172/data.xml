  <summary date="2022-11-18T14:29:11Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits an individual who is not a U.S. citizen from voting in any elections in the District of Columbia (DC).

Federal law bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections; however, the DC Council passed a bill on October 18, 2022, that allows noncitizens who meet residency and other requirements to vote in local elections.</summary>
