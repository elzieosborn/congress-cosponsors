    "text": "Social Security Parity Act\n\nThis bill waives, under certain conditions, the requirement that an individual must be divorced for at least two years before being able to claim Social Security spousal benefits on the former spouse's work record.\n\nCurrently, if a former spouse is eligible for but has not claimed Social Security retirement or disability benefits, a divorced individual may claim spousal benefits provided that individual meets certain eligibility criteria and the divorce has been final for at least two years. This bill deems the two-year requirement met when a former spouse remarries someone other than the divorced individual within two years of the divorce."
