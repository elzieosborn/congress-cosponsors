  <summary date="2021-11-23T21:08:14Z" status="Passed House">Security Screening During COVID-19 Act

This bill requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to implement a plan to enhance security operations at airports during the COVID-19 national emergency in order to reduce risk of the spread of the coronavirus at passenger screening checkpoints and among the TSA workforce.

The TSA may consult with stakeholders and their workforce when developing the plan. Additionally, the TSA is not required to issue or implement the plan upon the termination of the COVID-19 national emergency.

The Government Accountability Office must issue a report on the implementation of the plan within one year after it is issued.</summary>
