This bill allows the plaintiffs of a 2015 lawsuit against the federal government relating to the 2009 General Motors bankruptcy to collect compensation from the government. The government must make lump-sum payments in specified amounts. (The lawsuit centered on the inability of the plaintiffs to seek relief from General Motors after the bankruptcy for injuries or deaths that occurred from defective vehicles before the bankruptcy.)</summary>
