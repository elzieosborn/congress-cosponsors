Current law requires a fine, imprisonment for up to two years, or both, for such an alien.\n\nAn alien who had been denied entry or removed three or more times and who later enters or attempts to enter the United States shall be fined, imprisoned for up to 10 years, or both.\n\nAn alien who was convicted of an aggravated felony or convicted at least two times before removal or departure and who subsequently enters or tries to enter the United States shall be imprisoned at least five years and for up to twenty years, and may also be fined. Currently, there is no minimum term of imprisonment for an alien who reenters after a conviction for an aggravated felony, and there are no criminal penalties for a reentering alien who had been convicted at least two times (other than the penalties for illegal reentry generally)."
