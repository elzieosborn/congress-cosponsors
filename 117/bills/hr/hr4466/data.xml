  <summary date="2021-11-19T19:53:10Z" status="Introduced in House">National Strategy for the Global Information Domain Act

This bill establishes a temporary working group, comprised of members (or attendees) of the National Security Council who are appointed by the President, to develop a national strategy for the global information domain. The global information domain refers to a sphere of strategic competition in which state and nonstate actors create, distort, obtain, disseminate, or otherwise engage with information to influence public opinion for national security, geopolitical, or economic purposes.

The global information domain strategy must, among other requirements, (1) prioritize the domain as vital to U.S. national security, (2) describe how adversarial actors define and control the domain and their use of artificial intelligence-enabled malign information, and (3) make recommendations to counter adversarial efforts.</summary>
