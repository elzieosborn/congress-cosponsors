    "text": "Mortgage Borrower Protection Act of 2022 \n\nThis bill requires an entity extending a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing agreement to receive written consent from each owner of any residential mortgage loan or other recorded lien on the property before extending such financing to the dwelling owner. (PACE financing is used to cover the costs of home improvements such as energy-efficient improvements. The subsequent lien is tied to the specific property in the form of a tax assessment.)\n\nConsent is not required if the PACE financing does not have priority over the mortgage loan or lien."
