This bill requires the Department of State to establish an Infectious Disease Monitoring Center within the American Institute in Taipei, Taiwan. (The U.S.-Taiwan relationship is unofficial, and the American Institute in Taiwan office in Taipei performs many of the same functions as an embassy.)

The center must seek to partner with the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control to monitor infectious diseases in the region, including by regularly monitoring, analyzing, and disseminating open-source material, such as viral strains and other pathogens, from countries in the region.</summary>
