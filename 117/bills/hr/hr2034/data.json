Further, the borrower must submit an application to ED for loan forgiveness.\n\n The bill prohibits borrowers from receiving refunds for any previously made payments.\n\nFurther, the bill specifies the notification requirements related to the availability of loan forgiveness.\n\nThe bill also excludes discharged student loan debt from an individual's gross income for tax purposes."
