The bill generally maintains this reallocation arrangement but also establishes certain circumstances when these funds must go to the urban county in which a recipient metropolitan city is located or to the recipient urban county directly.\n\nAn urban county receiving reallocated funds designated for a recipient metropolitan city must spend these funds for the benefit of the metropolitan cities located within the county."
