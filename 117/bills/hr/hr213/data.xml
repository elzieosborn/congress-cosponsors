This bill reallocates to urban counties, under certain circumstances, Emergency Solutions Grant funds to help individuals and families regain permanent housing after experiencing a housing crisis or homelessness.

Currently, the Department of Housing and Urban Development typically reallocates the funds to the state in which a city or county is located if the funds going to a recipient metropolitan city or urban county are less than a specified amount. The bill generally maintains this reallocation arrangement but also establishes certain circumstances when these funds must go to the urban county in which a recipient metropolitan city is located or to the recipient urban county directly.

An urban county receiving reallocated funds designated for a recipient metropolitan city must spend these funds for the benefit of the metropolitan cities located within the county.</summary>
