Any such agreement must require the lessee to submit a form disclosing any foreign ownership interest in the outlease.\n\nThe GSA may not enter into such an outlease with the President, the Vice President, the head of an executive agency, or a Member of Congress.\n\nThe outlease shall not take effect if Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval of the outlease and such joint resolution is signed by the President."
