This bill directs the Department of Labor to award grants to eligible entities to develop and carry out projects to recruit, retain, or provide advancement opportunities to direct care workers. The term direct care worker includes home health aides, psychiatric aides, nursing assistants, and personal care aides who assist seniors and persons with disabilities in their homes.

After the completion of each project assisted with a grant, the Government Accountability Office must study and report to Congress on (1) an assessment of how the project assisted in the recruitment, retention, or advancement of direct care workers; and (2) recommendations for appropriate legislative or administrative actions.</summary>
