The bill also requires the AOC to remove any remaining perimeter fencing that was installed around the Capitol in January 2021, and it prohibits the AOC from installing any such fencing in the future unless at least three members of the USCP board approve the installation.\n\nThe bill places the Librarian of Congress on the USCP board."
