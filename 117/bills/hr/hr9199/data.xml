This bill requires certain persons to register as agents of a foreign principal if the foreign principal in question is China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, or Syria.

Currently, the Foreign Agents Registration Act exempts certain agents from the act's registration requirements, including agents (1) engaged only in private and nonpolitical activities to advance a foreign principal's bona fide trade or commerce interests, or (2) engaged in certain lobbying activities and where the agent has registered as a lobbyist. Under this bill, these exemptions shall not apply if the foreign principal is one of the countries specified in this bill.

The changes made by this bill shall expire on October 1, 2025.</summary>
