    "text": "Achieving Independence through Degrees Act or the AID Act\n\nThis bill revises certain federal student-aid programs. Among other changes, the bill expands access to Pell Grants, expands loan counseling requirements, revises the Federal Work-Study Program, updates the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) process, and extends Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to certain students.\n\nThe bill expands access to Pell Grants by (1) increasing the maximum award and indexing it for inflation; (2) increasing the semester eligibility limit to 15 semesters; (3) extending eligibility to certain short-term workforce training programs; (4) excluding from gross income, for income tax purposes, any amount received as a Pell Grant; and (5) allowing Pell Grants to be used for living and non-tuition expenses.\n\nThe bill revises student loan counseling requirements applicable to institutions of higher education (IHEs) by requiring annual financial counseling and expanding exit counseling.\n\nAdditionally, the bill permanently reauthorizes the Federal Work-Study Program and otherwise revises the program, including by allocating program funds to IHEs based on the amount of Pell Grant funds received by each IHE. It establishes a pilot program that provides work-based learning opportunities for students who demonstrate exceptional financial need.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to allow students to complete FAFSA as independent students under special circumstances. Further, the bill prohibits ED from asking about drug-related convictions on FAFSA.\n\nThe bill also allows certain students, including those who have an expected family contribution of zero, to qualify for SNAP benefits."
