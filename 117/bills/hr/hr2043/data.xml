  <summary date="2022-07-15T21:47:13Z" status="Reported to House, Part I">Periodically Listing Updates to Management Act or the PLUM Act 

This bill replaces the congressional publication titled United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions, commonly known as the PLUM Book, with an online public directory.

The PLUM Book contains personnel information for federal civil service leadership and support positions in the legislative and executive branches that may be subject to noncompetitive appointment, including heads of agencies and policy executives. The book is used to identify presidentially appointed positions and is published every four years (after each presidential election) by certain congressional committees.

The bill requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to publish the information contained in the PLUM Book on a public website in a format that is easily searchable and that otherwise meets certain data standards. Agencies must upload updated information to the website on a monthly basis; OPM must verify the accuracy of the information twice a year in coordination with the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.

The bill terminates publication of the PLUM Book in its current form on January 1, 2024.</summary>
