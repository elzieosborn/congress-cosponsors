Such an organization must periodically report to the Department of Justice certain information relating to its relationships to the relevant Russian foreign principals.\n\nThe bill also imposes additional reporting requirements on a tax-exempt organization that has (1) received any thing of value from a Russian foreign principal since February 1, 2014; and (2) engaged in political activities to discourage the U.S. production of oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or critical minerals."
