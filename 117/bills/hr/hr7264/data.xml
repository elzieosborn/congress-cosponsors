  <summary date="2022-10-05T14:30:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Countering Russian Influence in our Politics Act of 2022

This bill requires tax-exempt organizations that receive any thing of value from a Russian foreign principal (e.g., Russia's government or a Russian national) to register as an agent of a foreign principal, with certain exceptions. Such an organization must periodically report to the Department of Justice certain information relating to its relationships to the relevant Russian foreign principals.

The bill also imposes additional reporting requirements on a tax-exempt organization that has (1) received any thing of value from a Russian foreign principal since February 1, 2014; and (2) engaged in political activities to discourage the U.S. production of oil, petroleum products, natural gas, or critical minerals.</summary>
