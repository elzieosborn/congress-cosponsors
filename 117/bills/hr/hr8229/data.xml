This bill requires private health insurance plans to apply benefits for mental health or substance use disorder services that are furnished via telehealth in the same manner as those services that are furnished in person.

Under current mental health parity rules, insurance plans that provide benefits for mental health or substance use disorder services are generally required to make those benefits comparable to the benefits the plan provides for medical and surgical care.</summary>
