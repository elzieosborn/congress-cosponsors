There is established a Makua Military Reservation Conveyance, Remediation, and Environmental Restoration Trust Fund to (1) make the reservation suitable for agriculture, residential use, and human habitation, including any remedial actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980; and (2) carry out this bill.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the state that shall govern\n\n the study; the conveyance; the timing, planning, methodology, and implementation for the removal of unexploded ordnance; and the use of the sums appropriated to the fund."
