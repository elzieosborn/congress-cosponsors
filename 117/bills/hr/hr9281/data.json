    "text": "Food Deserts Act \n\nThis bill establishes a Department of Agriculture program to provide grants to states for revolving funds to support the establishment and operation of grocery stores in underserved communities.\n\nAn underserved community is a community that has (1) limited access to affordable, healthy foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, in grocery retail stores or farmer-to-consumer direct markets; and (2) a high rate of hunger or food insecurity or a high poverty rate.\n\nStates must use the funds to make loans to support grocery stores in underserved communities, including for opening a store (excluding new construction), or supporting or purchasing an existing store.\n\nStates may only make loans for grocery stores that meet requirements related to\n\n emphasizing unprocessed, healthful foods; providing staple foods and a variety of raw fruits and vegetables; having a plan to keep the foods in stock; charging affordable prices at or below market averages; meeting specified matching requirements using nonfederal funds; and being qualified to operate a store or having partnerships with organizations that provide technical assistance. States must prioritize loan applications from entities that meet criteria related to\n\n hiring workers from the underserved community, providing classes or educational information about a healthful diet, sourcing food from local urban farms and gardens, or demonstrating existing supply chain relationships or expertise in the grocery industry."
