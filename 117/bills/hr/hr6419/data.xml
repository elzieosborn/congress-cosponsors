This bill revises provisions regarding the prohibition on federal contractors, including defense contractors, inquiring about applicants' criminal histories prior to conditional offers of employment.

The bill allows the Department of Labor to investigate compliance by a contractor by conducting a compliance evaluation. Currently, Labor investigates compliance pursuant to an applicant's complaint.

The bill also expands the sanctions that Labor may impose on a contractor with more than one violation of the prohibition.</summary>
