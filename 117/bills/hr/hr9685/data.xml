This bill modifies provisions related to asylum seekers and addresses related issues.

For example, the bill (1) eliminates the statutory time limit for applying for asylum (currently one year after arriving in the United States), (2) establishes stateless protected status for individuals who are not considered a national by any country under that country&#8217;s law, and (3) requires the goal for refugee admissions for any given fiscal year to be no fewer than 125,000.</summary>
