This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue regulations concerning the patient medication information that is included in the labeling for prescription medications.

The regulations must impose various requirements, such as requiring the information to (1) be scientifically accurate and approved by the FDA; (2) include general directions for proper use and warnings that are written in understandable plain language; (3) contain information about known clinically important interactions with drugs, food, and other substances; (4) include a statement of whether there is sufficient data about the drug's use by specified subpopulations, such as children or pregnant women; and (5) be provided in a printed format with each prescription dispensed.

The bill prohibits prescription medications that fail to meet this bill's requirements.</summary>
