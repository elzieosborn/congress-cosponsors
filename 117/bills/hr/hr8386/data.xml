  <summary date="2022-07-25T10:13:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish paid predoctoral and postdoctoral internship programs for the purpose of training licensed officials (e.g., licensed professional counselors) to work as VA behavioral health providers at VA medical facilities.

As a condition of participating in such an internship program, the participant must enter into an agreement with the VA to work on a full-time basis as a behavioral health provider for a period of time that is at least equivalent to the period of participation in the internship program.</summary>
