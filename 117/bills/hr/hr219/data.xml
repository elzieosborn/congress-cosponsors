This bill establishes an additional basis for excluding a foreign country from designation as a beneficiary developing country for the purposes of preferential trade treatment.

 Specifically, the bill makes a country ineligible for this designation if it fails to effectively enforce its environmental laws or to fulfill its international environmental obligations. The President, when making this designation, must take into account the extent to which a country effectively enforces these laws and fulfills these obligations.</summary>
