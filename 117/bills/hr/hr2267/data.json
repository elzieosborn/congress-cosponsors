Energy savings performance contract means a contract that provides for the performance of services for the design, acquisition, installation, testing, operation, maintenance, or repair of an energy conservation measure, water conservation measure, resiliency-related measure, utility cost savings measure, or series of measures.\n\nUpon the request of a state, DOE must provide information and technical assistance in the development and implementation of such a state program.\n\nFurther, DOE must establish a national project facilitator certification program to expand the availability of individuals who are trained and certified to work on behalf of the state and local government as project facilitators who will assist with the oversight of projects under state programs."
