This bill imposes an excise tax on the sale of a water-intensive crop. The tax is 300% of the price for which the crop is sold and is paid by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the crop.

The bill defines water-intensive crop as a crop grown in an area experiencing prolonged drought (i.e., an area experiencing severe, extreme, or exceptional drought lasting more than six months) at the time such crop is grown, and by a manufacturer, producer, or importer that is a foreign corporation or foreign government.</summary>
