This bill establishes the For Communities Trust Fund to be funded by specified environmental taxes for the purpose of awarding grants to states in cooperative agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency to (1) assist in relocation efforts for individuals or groups who live within five miles of facilities that are a major source or area source of certain emissions, or (2) protect or remediate areas affected by emissions of hazardous air pollutants or releases of hazardous substances from such facilities.

The bill increases the excise tax on certain chemicals to adjust for inflation and removes tax exemptions related to crude oil and petroleum products imported into the United States.</summary>
