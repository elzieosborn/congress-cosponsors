This bill reduces cost-sharing requirements for grants directly awarded to certain nonprofit organizations during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period and the following five years. Eligible nonprofit organizations are those in jurisdictions with more than 20% of individuals living below the poverty line.

Specifically, the bill provides that (1) any cost-sharing requirement shall be waived during a COVID-19 emergency period; and (2) in the five years following such an emergency, any cost-sharing requirement shall be reduced by 25%.</summary>
