    "text": "Veteran Entrepreneurs Act of 2021\n\nThis bill allows a business-related tax credit\u00a0of 25% of up to $400,000 of the\u00a0franchise fees paid or incurred by an eligible veteran\u00a0for the purchase of a franchise. The bill reduces the amount of such credit if the veteran does not own 100% of the stock or capital or profits interest of the franchisee.\n\nAn eligible veteran is a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service; was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable; and who pays or incurs a franchise fee in connection with a franchise agreement with a franchisor.\n\nThe veteran may elect to transfer the credit to an eligible franchisor in exchange for a discount in the franchise fee commensurate with the value of the credit.\n\n The Small Business Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs must provide information about the tax credit allowed by this bill to veterans service organizations and veteran advocacy groups."
