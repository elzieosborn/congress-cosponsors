This bill modifies the tax credit for employer-provided child care to (1) allow the credit for the reimbursement of costs necessary for an employee's employment, and (2) allow an increased credit for certain small businesses (i.e., businesses with gross receipts not exceeding $25 million and with not more than 50 employees in a taxable year).

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to complete a study that examines certain aspects of the tax credit.</summary>
