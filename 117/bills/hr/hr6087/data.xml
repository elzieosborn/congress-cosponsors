  <summary date="2022-06-16T23:33:19Z" status="Passed House">Improving Access to Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act of 2022

This bill expands the role of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in providing services to injured federal workers under the federal workers' compensation program. 

Specifically, under the program, nurse practitioners and physician assistants acting within the scope of their practice may (1) prescribe or recommend treatment for injured federal workers; (2) certify the nature of an injury and probable extent of disability; (3) provide prescribed treatment for injured federal workers; and (4) participate, with a physician designated by the Department of Labor, in a mandatory workers' compensation examination of an injured worker. In general, only physicians may fulfill these roles under current law.</summary>
