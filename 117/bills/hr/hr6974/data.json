    "text": "This bill revises coastwise laws, commonly known as the Jones Act, to temporarily allow foreign vessels that are not Russian to transport oil, liquefied natural gas, and related products between a port in Hawaii and another U.S. port. The Jones Act requires that vessels transporting cargo domestically must be U.S.-built and generally owned and crewed by U.S. citizens.\n\nForeign vessels may transport petroleum crude oil, petroleum, petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas between Hawaii and other U.S. ports while there is a ban on transporting such products from Russia. However, the bill does not apply to Russian-flagged vessels or vessels that are owned by a Russian national or the Russian government."
