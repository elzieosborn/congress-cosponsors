  <summary date="2022-09-07T12:20:18Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes programs to mitigate the impact of marine traffic on marine ecosystems and wildlife, with a particular emphasis on underwater noise.

The National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA) must

 maintain and expand activities to collect and assess underwater sounds in high-priority ocean and coastal locations, award grants to port authorities or related entities for implementing measures to mitigate the impact of port operations and marine traffic on marine mammals, and implement a program to reduce collisions between large whales and marine vessels. In addition, the Maritime Administration must award grants to academic or research institutions, U.S. nationals or corporations, or state or tribal governments for developing and implementing technologies that reduce underwater noise from marine vessels. The administration must also report to Congress about nonclassified naval technologies that reduce underwater noise from marine vessels.</summary>
