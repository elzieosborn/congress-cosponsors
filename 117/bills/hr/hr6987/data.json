In addition, the Maritime Administration must award grants to academic or research institutions, U.S. nationals or corporations, or state or tribal governments for developing and implementing technologies that reduce underwater noise from marine vessels. The administration must also report to Congress about nonclassified naval technologies that reduce underwater noise from marine vessels."
