  <summary date="2022-07-15T21:24:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Term Extension for AmeriCorps Members Act

This bill allows a state's AmeriCorps State Service Commission to permit an AmeriCorps member with compelling circumstances to continue service in a national service position in that state beyond the current four term cap. However, the bill prohibits the member from receiving an additional national service education award for that extended service.</summary>
