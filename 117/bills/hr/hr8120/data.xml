This bill prohibits the importation of certain products from Russia. This prohibition applies to, among other products, uranium, plywood, silver, and platinum.

The President may waive this prohibition for one or more of these products, subject to congressional disapproval, if the President certifies that such waiver is in the national interest.

Additionally, the President may terminate this prohibition, subject to congressional disapproval, if the President certifies that Russia (1) has reached an agreement to withdraw Russian forces and cease military hostilities in Ukraine, (2) poses no immediate military threat of aggression to any North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, and (3) recognizes the right of the Ukrainian people to independently and freely choose their own government.</summary>
