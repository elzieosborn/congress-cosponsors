Certain grounds for inadmissibility, such as the public charge ground, shall not apply.\n\nThe spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of an eligible individual shall also be eligible.\n\nIf an individual has applied for lawful permanent resident status under this bill and is subject to exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, DHS may not order that individual's removal unless DHS has made a final determination to deny the application.\n\nDHS must provide work authorization to an individual whose application has been pending for more than 180 days, and may also provide authorization before that."
