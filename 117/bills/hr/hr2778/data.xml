  <summary date="2021-07-08T18:22:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Daniel J. Harvey Jr. and Adam Lambert Improving Servicemember Transition to Reduce Veteran Suicide Act

This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to jointly implement a five-year pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing specified counseling and services as part of the Transition Assistance Program for members of the Armed Forces as a means of reducing the incidence of suicide among veterans.

Specifically, the pilot program would involve a three-hour counseling module and the provision of contact information for a counseling or similar facility in the locality where the veteran intends to reside. Additionally, the participating veterans must submit medical records in connection with their service in the Armed Forces, regardless of whether they intend to file a claim for benefits for a service-connected disability.

Under the program, a social worker or behavioral health coordinator from the VA must contact the veteran within 90 days after the member is discharged or released from service to schedule a follow-up appointment.

At least 10 DOD Transition Assistance Centers must be jointly selected to carry out the pilot program.</summary>
