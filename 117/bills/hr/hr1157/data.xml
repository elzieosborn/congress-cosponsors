  <summary date="2021-06-07T23:56:27Z" status="Passed House">Department of State Authorization Act of 2021

This bill modifies the management and operations of the Department of State through various measures. These include requiring actions to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, establishing offices and roles to carry out designated functions, and providing for certain public diplomacy and anti-corruption measures.

Specifically, the bill addresses personnel matters within the State Department by, for example, requiring the State Department to submit a comprehensive five-year strategic staffing plan and otherwise modifying provisions related to home leave travel, employee assignment restrictions and preclusions, and the recall and reemployment of career members of the Foreign and civil service. Further, the bill establishes recruitment, retention, and promotion requirements to further the goal of achieving a more diverse workforce at the State Department.

In addition, the bill modifies the organization and operations of the State Department by, among other things, (1) providing statutory authority for the Bureau of Consular Affairs and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration; and (2) authorizing the establishment of an Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources to handle global energy-related issues.

 The bill also establishes measures to address State Department information and data security, revises procedures and requirements related to the overseas construction of embassies and consulates, and requires the State Department to report on the efforts of the Coronavirus Repatriation Task Force.</summary>
