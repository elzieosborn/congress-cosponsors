This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to revise its flight time requirements for airplanes with a single-engine rating.

Specifically, DOT must establish an exception to require a straight-line distance of at least 110 nautical miles for the longest segment cross-country flight requirement on a cross-country flight of 300 nautical miles or more if such requirement is being met in Guam, Hawaii, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</summary>
