This bill imposes an excise tax on large employers (employing an average of at least 500 full-time employees in the preceding calendar year) for qualified federal benefits received by their employees. The bill defines qualified federal benefits to include food stamps, school lunches, section 8 housing subsidies, and Medicaid benefits. It exempts employers that pay their employees $15 per hour and have less than $100 million in assets from classification as a large employer, thus exempting such employers from the excise tax.

The bill also makes it an unlawful employment practice for any large employer to inquire whether an applicant for employment receives federal benefits.</summary>
