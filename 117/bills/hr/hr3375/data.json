    "text": "No Sanctuary for Criminals Act\n\nThis bill addresses issues related to immigration enforcement.\n\nA government entity may not prohibit its personnel or another government entity from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts or making inquiries about an individual's immigration status. Currently, a government entity is only barred from prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nA noncomplying state or local government shall be ineligible for certain grants and assistance related to law enforcement, terrorism, and immigration.\n\nDHS may (1) decline to transfer a detained alien to a noncomplying government entity even if that entity has issued a writ or warrant, and (2) issue a detainer if it believes that an individual arrested for any criminal or motor vehicle offense is inadmissible or deportable. DHS may not transfer an alien with a final order of removal to a noncomplying government entity.\n\nThe bill also allows a victim of certain felonies (including murder and rape) to sue a state or local government entity if that entity had refused to honor an immigration detainer request and released the individual who later committed the crime.\n\nFurthermore, the bill (1) expands the categories of offenses requiring mandatory detention, (2) provides immunity for a state or local government entity or official temporarily detaining an alien under federal authority, (3) provides that an alien may be detained without time limitation while removal proceedings are pending, and (4) restricts a detained alien's release on bond."
