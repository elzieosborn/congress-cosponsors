    "text": "American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 This bill provides additional relief to address the continued impact of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) on the economy, public health, state and local governments, individuals, and businesses.\n\nTITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY\n\nSubtitle A--Agriculture\n\n(Sec. 1001) This section provides funding for FY2021 to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to (1) purchase food and agricultural commodities; (2) purchase and distribute agricultural commodities (including fresh produce, dairy, seafood, eggs, and meat) to individuals in need; (3) provide grants and loans for small or midsized food processors or distributors, seafood processing facilities and processing vessels, farmers markets, producers, or other organizations to respond to COVID-19; and (4) provide grants, loans, and other assistance to maintain and improve food and agricultural supply chain resiliency.\n\nThe section also requires USDA to use specified amounts of the funding to (1) conduct animal surveillance and monitoring related to COVID-19; and (2) reduce overtime inspection costs borne by federally inspected small and very small meat, poultry, or egg processors.\n\n(Sec. 1002)This section provides funding for, and directs USDA to establish, an emergency pilot program to provide grants to certain applicants for rural health care and other rural development needs related to COVID-19.\n\n(Sec. 1003) This section provides funding for necessary administrative expenses associated with carrying out this subtitle.\n\n(Sec. 1004) This section provides funding through FY2022 to the Office of the Inspector General of USDA for audits, investigations, and other oversight activities of projects and activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n(Sec. 1005) This section provides funding for USDA to pay off outstanding farm loan debts of socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.\n\n(Sec. 1006) This section provides funding for USDA to address historical discrimination and disparities in the agriculture sector.\n\nSpecifically, USDA must use specified amounts to\n\n provide outreach, mediation, training, and assistance on issues concerning food, agriculture, agricultural credit, agricultural extension, rural development, or nutrition to certain socially disadvantaged groups, including socially disadvantaged farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners; provide grants and loans to improve land access for such groups; fund one or more equity commissions to address racial equity issues within USDA and its programs; support and supplement agricultural research, education, and extension, as well as scholarships and programs that provide internships and pathways to federal employment; and provide financial assistance to socially disadvantaged farmers, ranchers, or forest landowners who are former farm loan borrowers and suffered related adverse actions or past discrimination or bias in USDA programs. (Sec. 1007) This section provides funding through FY2022 to use the Commodity Credit Corporation to make commodities available and pay associated expenses for the Food for Peace program.\n\nSubtitle B--Nutrition\n\n(Sec. 1101) This section extends through FY2021 the requirement to calculate the value of benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) by using 115% of the June 2020 value of the thrifty food plan. It also provides funding through FY2023 for the costs of state administrative expenses and administering SNAP.\n\n(Sec. 1102) This section provides additional funding through FY2026 for USDA to (1) make technological improvements to improve online purchasing in SNAP; (2) modernize electronic benefit transfer technology; (3) support the mobile technologies demonstration projects and the use of mobile technologies; and (4) provide technical assistance to educate retailers on the process and technical requirements for the online acceptance of SNAP benefits, mobile payments, and electronic benefit transfer modernization initiatives.\n\n(Sec. 1103) This section provides additional funding through FY2027 for USDA to provide grants to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa for nutrition assistance.\n\n(Sec. 1104) This section provides funding through FY2022 to USDA for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.\n\n(Sec. 1105) This section provides authority and funding for USDA to approve state requests to increase the amount of a cash-value voucher under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) for a qualified food package to up to $35 for a four-month period during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Authority to increase the amount of a cash-value voucher shall terminate on September 30, 2021. (Cash-value vouchers are redeemable for fruits and vegetables as part of a WIC food package.)\n\n(Sec. 1106)This section provides funding for USDA to carry out outreach, innovation, and program modernization efforts to increase participation in and redemption of benefits under WIC, including through appropriate waivers and flexibilities. However, such waivers and flexibilities may not relate to the content of WIC food packages or nondiscrimination requirements.\n\n(Sec. 1107)This section directs USDA to reimburse institutions that are emergency shelters for meals and supplements provided under the Child and Adult Care Food Program during the COVID-19 public health emergency to individuals who have not attained the age of 25 and who are receiving assistance from such shelters. Under current law, emergency shelters may not receive reimbursement for meals and supplements provided to individuals who are older than age 18.\n\n(Sec. 1108) This section expands the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program by authorizing it to be implemented during any school year in which there is a COVID-19 public health emergency designation in effect. It also allows the program to operate during the summer months.\n\n(The P-EBT program allows USDA to approve state plans to provide emergency nutrition benefits to households with children who would otherwise receive free or reduced-price school meals if their schools were not closed due to a public health emergency.)\n\nTITLE II--COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\nSubtitle A--Education Matters\n\nPart 1--Department of Education\n\n(Sec. 2001) This section provides additional FY2021 funding for the Department of Education (ED) to assist states with addressing the impacts of COVID-19 on elementary and secondary schools.\n\nED must use specified funds to support the identification, enrollment, and school participation of homeless children and youth.\n\nLocal educational agencies (LEAs) must reserve funds to address student learning loss. The remaining funds may be used for any allowable purpose under federal education programs and for other specified purposes, including for the purchase of sanitization supplies and educational technology.\n\nLEAs must, within 30 days of receiving funds, develop and publish plans to safely reopen schools for in-person instruction.\n\n(Sec. 2002) This section provides additional FY2021 funding for the Emergency Assistance to Non-Public Schools program, through which states must provide services or assistance to nonpublic schools that enroll a significant percentage of low-income students and are most impacted by COVID-19. These funds may not be used for reimbursements to nonpublic schools.\n\n(Sec. 2003) This section provides additional FY2021 funding for institutions of higher education (IHEs).\n\nIHEs must allocate at least half of these funds to provide emergency financial-aid grants to students.\n\n(Sec. 2004) This section outlines maintenance-of-effort requirements for states, which may be waived by ED.
