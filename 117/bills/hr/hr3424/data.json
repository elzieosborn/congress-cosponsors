    "text": "Global Pandemic Prevention and Biosecurity Act\n\nThis bill establishes a task force and requires the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to take specified measures to respond to and prevent zoonotic (animal-to-human) disease outbreaks.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes the Global Zoonotic Disease Task Force to ensure an integrated approach to preventing, detecting, preparing for, and responding to zoonotic spillover and zoonotic disease outbreaks that may pose a threat to global health security.\n\nThe bill directs the State Department and the USAID to work with international stakeholders on measures that include (1) preventing zoonotic spillover events, (2) preventing degradation and fragmentation of forests and other ecosystems to minimize interactions between wildlife and human populations, and (3) strengthening global capacity for detection of zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential.\n\nFurther, the USAID must develop and publish a strategy for food security, global health, and biodiversity protection, including information about zoonotic disease surveillance. To help implement and finance the strategy, the USAID must establish a Conservation Corps to provide Americans eligible for service abroad to deliver technical and strategic assistance.\n\nThe bill also authorizes a program within the USAID to prevent spillover events, epidemics, and pandemics through specified activities."
