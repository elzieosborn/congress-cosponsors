Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to be the same as such categories and timelines under the Public Assistance Program; issue such regulations as necessary to update the Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide to include guidance on the wildfire-specific challenges, including debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the resulting toxicity of drinking water resources; and conduct a review of the benefit cost analysis criteria for mitigation projects under the Stafford Act to consider a broader range of factors, including carbon sequestration, improved water quality, and lessening disaster impact on traditionally underserved communities."
