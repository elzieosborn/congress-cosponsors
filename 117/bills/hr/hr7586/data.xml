This bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to restrict migration and imports from foreign countries to prevent the introduction of illicit drugs into the United States.

Current law authorizes HHS to restrict migration and imports from foreign countries to prevent the introduction of communicable diseases. Under this bill, HHS may also restrict migration and imports from a country if HHS determines that introduction of certain controlled substances (e.g., opiates, stimulants, or fentanyl-related substances) from that country poses a risk to public health. HHS must consult with the Department of Justice in making the determination.</summary>
