This bill requires states to provide designated congressional election observers with full access to observe the administration procedures of federal elections. The bill prohibits such an observer from handling ballots or elections equipment, advocating for a position or candidate, taking any action to reduce ballot secrecy, or otherwise interfering with the elections administration process.

Designated congressional election observer refers to an individual who is designated in writing by specified congressional committees to gather information with respect to an election, including in the event that the election is contested in the House of Representatives or the Senate and for other purposes permitted by Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution.</summary>
