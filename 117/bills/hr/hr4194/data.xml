  <summary date="2022-09-20T14:43:10Z" status="Introduced in House">The People's Response Act

This bill establishes multiple grant programs and requirements to promote qualified approaches to community safety. These are programs or services that are disconnected from carceral institutions (e.g., law enforcement, child welfare services, and immigration enforcement).

Specifically, the bill establishes the Division of Community Safety within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to administer the grants and carry out related activities. These include grants for community-based organizations to support qualified approaches to community safety, such as

 unarmed first responder agencies and 9-1-1 diversion programs; neighborhood-level interventions, including safe passage to school and violence interruption programs; behavioral health treatment, nutrition support, and other public health programs; housing security programs; and programs for youth and families, survivors of violence, and individuals exiting incarceration or criminal supervision. Additionally, the division must administer grants pertaining to qualified approaches for community safety for state and local governments and hiring and training first responders.

The bill also establishes an advisory board to oversee the division's activities. Membership on the board must reflect the racial, ethnic, and other demographic diversities of the United States. The board must also include members who have personal experience with the criminal justice system.

Furthermore, HHS must set up (1) a federal health response unit to respond to any public health emergency, assist with qualified approaches to community safety, and provide resources for safe and inclusive schools; and (2) an interagency task force to promote qualified approaches to community safety across federal programs.</summary>
