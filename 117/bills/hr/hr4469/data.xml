  <summary date="2022-02-14T22:05:25Z" status="Introduced in House">AI in Counterterrorism Oversight Enhancement Act

This bill expands the responsibilities of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to include oversight of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in counterterrorism and addresses related issues.

Specifically, the board must continually review any AI-enabled technologies used in counterterrorism efforts and determine whether such technologies protect privacy and civil liberties and adhere to relevant policies.

The bill also expands the board's authorities to access or subpoena information to include information about AI-enabled technologies used for counterintelligence, such as the training and testing processes for such technologies.

Furthermore, the bill expands the responsibilities of privacy and civil liberties officers to include responsibilities related to AI-enabled technologies used in counterterrorism. (Currently, the statute requires certain departments and agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to each designate one senior officer as a privacy and civil liberties officer to provide certain information to the board.)</summary>
