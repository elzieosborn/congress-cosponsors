    "text": "Digital Civil and Human Rights Act of 2022\n\nThis bill establishes prohibitions on the use of automated systems in a discriminatory manner.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits (1) a federal agency, U.S. court, or state, local, or tribal government from using any automated decision system that has a disparate impact on the basis of race, national origin, color, religion, disability, or sex; or (2) the use of automated systems with bias by the Department of Defense. Each federal agency must maintain on its public website a bias data sheet for each automated decision system used by such agency with the potential for a disparate impact on such bases.\n\nThe bill prohibits a respondent, in connection with the selection or referral of applicants or candidates for employment or promotion, from using any automated decision system that has a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nThe bill prohibits places of public accommodation from using in their operations that affect commerce any decision system that has a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nThe bill requires (1) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to submit to Congress a report on the use within the intelligence community of automated decision systems with an adverse distinction based on race, religion, sex, health, age, or any other similar criteria; and (2) the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop, publish, and maintain standards for reporting bias in an automated decision system."
