Open RAN networks are wireless networks that follow the Open Radio Access Network approach to standardization, promoting the use of open interface standards in the portion of the telecommunications network that connects wireless devices (e.g., mobile phones) to the core of the network.\n\nThe NTIA must also conduct outreach and provide assistance regarding participation in the Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Grant Program."
