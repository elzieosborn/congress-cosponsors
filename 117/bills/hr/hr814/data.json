    "text": "Union Accountability Act This bill nullifies the executive order titled Protecting the Federal Workforce, which was issued on January 22, 2021.\n\nThe order revoked previous executive orders\u00a0concerning federal-employee collective bargaining and classifications. Specifically, it revoked orders that\n\n limited the use of unrestricted grants for union activity, specified objectives for agencies to negotiate collective-bargaining agreements and established the Interagency Labor Relations Working Group, established principles for the removal and discipline of federal employees and other personnel issues, and placed certain executive agency positions under a new schedule in the excepted service instead of the competitive service. The order also instructs agencies to engage in collective bargaining negotiations over certain non-mandatory subjects, and requires the Office of Personnel Management to provide the President with recommendations to promote a minimum wage of $15 an hour for federal employees."
