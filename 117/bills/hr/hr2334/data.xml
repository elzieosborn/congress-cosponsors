This bill revises the fixed guideway capital investment grant program to include rural start projects within the program. It also directs the Department of Transportation to establish an innovative mobility and technology deployment grants program to assist states, local governments, or publicly owned operators of public transportation with financing certain public transportation projects.

The bill also provides additional funding and flexibility for other transportation projects, including for projects in areas that are designated as medically underserved.</summary>
