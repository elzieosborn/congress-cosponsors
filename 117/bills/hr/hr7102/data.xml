This bill requires the President to promulgate a rule prohibiting the export of crude oil and finished motor gasoline produced in the United States. The prohibition may not end until the earlier of (1) the date that the President determines the national average price for unleaded gasoline has been, for at least 30 days, at or below the national average price for unleaded gasoline on January 1, 2022; or (2) the date that the President determines is the formal end to the conflict between Russian and Ukraine.
