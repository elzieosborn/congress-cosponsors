This bill provides protections and incentives for whistleblowers who disclose information about, or refuse to participate in, an activity they reasonably believe is a potential violation of any law, rule, or regulation enforced by the Federal Trade Commission.

Specifically, it prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers and provides monetary incentives for information that leads to administrative or judicial actions that result in sanctions exceeding $1 million.</summary>
