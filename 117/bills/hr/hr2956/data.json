    "text": "Safety, Accountability, and Federal Enforcement of Limos Act of 2021 or the SAFE Limos Act\n\nThis bill sets out requirements to improve the safety of limousines.\n\nWithin two years of the bill's enactment, the Department of Transportation (DOT) must apply to newly manufactured limousines specified motor vehicle safety standards related to the installation of seat belts and other occupant crash protections. In addition, DOT must report on the feasibility, benefits, and costs of retrofitting limousines to meet those standards.\n\nDOT must also develop additional motor vehicle safety standards to improve limousine safety. This includes standards related to (1) side impact protection, roof crush resistance, and other aspects of crashworthiness; (2) evacuation in the event the exit in the passenger compartment is blocked; and (3) the use of event data recorders.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires that individuals who remodel new limousines submit to DOT and annually update a plan for mitigating limousine safety risks. The plan must include, among other topics, verification that the remodeled limousines meet applicable safety standards. Further, individuals who modify used vehicles into limousines must certify that the modified vehicles meet such standards.\n\nThe bill also requires limousine operators to disclose the date of, results of, and any corrective action needed to pass the most recent vehicle inspection. The Federal Trade Commissions shall enforce the disclosure requirements."
