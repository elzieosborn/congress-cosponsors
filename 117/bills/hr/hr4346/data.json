In awarding federal financial assistance to covered entities under such additional program, Commerce must give priority to covered entities that support the resiliency of semiconductor supply chains for critical manufacturing industries in the United States.\n\nNo funds made available under the program may be used to construct, modify, or improve a facility outside of the United States.\n\nThis section makes it an objective of the National Semiconductor Technology Center to grow the domestic semiconductor workforce. This section provides for the capitalization by the center of the investment fund to support startups and collaborations between startups, academia, established companies, and new ventures. This section revises the functions of the center to specify that its support to incentivize and expand participation in programs related to microelectronics shall be geographically diverse and include community colleges.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) may establish not more than two more Manufacturing USA Institutes. Commerce may award financial assistance to any such institute for work related to semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n(Sec. 104) The Department of Commerce shall establish activities within the financial assistance program relating to inclusion of economically disadvantaged individuals, minority-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and women-owned businesses.\n\n (Sec. 105) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall evaluate how the federal government could take specific actions to address shortages in the semiconductor supply chain, including (1) demand-side incentives, including incentives related to the information and communications technology supply chain; and (2) additional incentives, at national and global scales, to accelerate utilization of leading edge semiconductor nodes to address shortages in mature semiconductor nodes.\n\nUnder such review, the GAO shall describe how projects are supporting the semiconductor needs of critical infrastructure industries in the United States, including those industries designated by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as essential industries.\n\nAlso under such review, drawing on data made available by the Department of Labor or other sources, an analysis of\n\n semiconductor industry data regarding businesses that are majority owned and controlled by minority individuals or women; or the number and amount of contracts and subcontracts awarded by each covered entity using funds made available under the financial assistance program disaggregated by recipients of each such contract or subcontracts that are majority owned and controlled by minority individuals or women; and aggregated workforce data, including data by race or ethnicity, sex, and job categories. This section includes in the annual report to Congress on the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund, in describing how and to whom amounts in such fund have been deployed, to include whether recipients are majority owned and controlled by minority individuals and majority owned and controlled by women.\n\n(Sec. 106) This section provides funding for the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund.\n\n(Sec. 107) This section establishes an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit in an amount equal to 25% of the qualified investment for a taxable year for any advanced manufacturing facility of an eligible taxpayer. The section provides for the application of such credit to partnerships or S corporations.\n\nDIVISION B--RESEARCH AND INNOVATION\n\nResearch and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act\n\nTITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SCIENCE FOR THE FUTURE\n\n(Sec. 10101) The Office of Science of the Department of Energy (DOE) shall carry out the construction, operation, and maintenance of user facilities to support the office's mission.\n\n (Sec. 10102) The Office of Science shall carry out a research and development program in basic energy sciences to understand, model, and control matter and energy at the electronic, atomic, and molecular levels to provide the foundations for new energy technologies, address scientific grand challenges, and support the energy, environment, and national security missions of DOE.\n\nIn carrying out chemistry-related research and development activities, the Office of Science shall prioritize research and development of sustainable chemistry to support, clean, safe, and economic alternatives and methodologies to traditional chemical products and processes.\n\nThe basic energy sciences national user facilities in operation shall include autonomous chemistry and materials synthesis and characterization facilities that leverage advances in artificial intelligence.\n\n DOE shall provide for the upgrade to the Advanced Photon Source, including the development of a multibend achromat lattice to produce a high flux of coherent x-rays within the hard x-ray energy region and a suite of beamlines optimized for such source.\n\n DOE shall provide for the proton power upgrade to the Spallation Neutron Source. In addition, DOE shall provide for a second target station for the Spallation Neutron Source.\n\n DOE shall provide for the upgrade to the Advanced Light Source, including the development of a multibend achromat lattice to produce a high flux of coherent x-rays within the soft x-ray energy region.\n\n DOE shall provide for the upgrade to the Linac Coherent Light Source II facility, including the development of experimental capabilities for high energy x-rays to reveal fundamental scientific discoveries.\n\n DOE shall provide for the construction of a cryomodule repair and maintenance facility to service the Linac Coherent Light Source II and subsequent upgrades.\n\n DOE shall provide for the recapitalization of the Nanoscale Science Research Centers, to include the upgrade of equipment at each center supported by the office to accelerate advances in the various fields of science, including nanoscience, materials, chemistry, biology, and quantum information science.\n\nDOE must provide for the development and construction of experimental stations to provide significant additional beamline and instrument capacity, complement the existing portfolio of beamlines, and complete the buildout of the National Synchrotron Light Source II.\n\nThe Office of Science shall support a program of research and development for the application of advanced computing practices to foundational and emerging research problems in chemistry and materials science.\n\nThe Office of Science shall support the development of a web-based platform to develop and provide
