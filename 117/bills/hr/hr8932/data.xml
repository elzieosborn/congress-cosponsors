This bill revises the requirements placed on institutions of higher education (IHEs) regarding the disclosure of their policies on transferring academic credits.

In particular, the bill specifies that an IHE must (1) include its credit transfer policies on its website and in at least one other relevant publication (e.g., a course catalogue); (2) include a link to the website of each IHE with which it has an articulation agreement; and (3) provide a list of transfer-related resources, including information regarding financial aid and relevant staff contact information.</summary>
