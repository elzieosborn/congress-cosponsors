This bill addresses the administration of Department of Defense (DOD) health care programs and benefits in Puerto Rico.

Specifically, the bill requires DOD to treat the administration of TRICARE Prime availability in Puerto Rico in a similar manner as a state.

The bill also requires DOD to ensure that, in providing travel and transportation allowances related to specialty medical treatment, individuals located in Puerto Rico are eligible to receive such allowances.

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office must coordinate with the Department of Health of Puerto Rico to share health information through the Joint Health Information Exchange.</summary>
