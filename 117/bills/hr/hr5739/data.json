    "text": "This bill revises certain requirements under the Federal Pell Grant Program for students with disabilities.\n\nCurrently, Pell Grant awards are based on enrollment status and a student must attend an institution of higher education (IHE) on a full-time basis in order to receive the maximum award amount. This bill provides an exception for a student with a disability who is receiving appropriate and reasonable accommodations for such disability. Specifically, the bill requires the amount of a Pell Grant to be calculated as if such a student is attending an IHE on a full-time basis, without regard to whether the student is attending less than full time.\n\nAdditionally, the bill extends the period of time during which a student with a disability may receive a Pell Grant. In particular, the bill allows a student to exceed the current 12-semester limit to complete the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study if required by the student's accommodations."
