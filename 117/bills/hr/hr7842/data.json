For example, the bill expedites the voluntary buyouts of such property.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires community plans for addressing repetitive loss properties and expands mitigation assistance for repairs to structures facing repetitive losses.\n\nThe bill also addresses the equity of NFIP mitigation assistance by requiring equity considerations in eligibility determinations, waiving the matching requirement for underserved communities, and expanding predisaster hazard mitigation assistance to high-risk communities."
