This bill revises the National Flood Insurance Program and expands assistance for properties that have experienced repetitive flood-related losses. For example, the bill expedites the voluntary buyouts of such property.

Additionally, the bill requires community plans for addressing repetitive loss properties and expands mitigation assistance for repairs to structures facing repetitive losses.

The bill also addresses the equity of NFIP mitigation assistance by requiring equity considerations in eligibility determinations, waiving the matching requirement for underserved communities, and expanding predisaster hazard mitigation assistance to high-risk communities.</summary>
