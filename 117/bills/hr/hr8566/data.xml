  <summary date="2023-08-24T20:11:17Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill imposes a 5% transfer fee on remittances sent to recipients outside of the United States, to be paid by the sender. The bill also establishes for U.S. citizens a tax credit equal to the amount that the citizen taxpayer paid in such transfer fees for any taxable year.

The bill also provides funding for various border-related activities, such as to build a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico barrier. The funding shall be equal to the amount collected by the transfer fee minus the tax credits allowed.</summary>
