The bill also establishes for U.S. citizens a tax credit equal to the amount that the citizen taxpayer paid in such transfer fees for any taxable year.\n\nThe bill also provides funding for various border-related activities, such as to build a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico barrier. The funding shall be equal to the amount collected by the transfer fee minus the tax credits allowed."
