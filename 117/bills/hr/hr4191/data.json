    "text": "Gold Star Spouses Non-Monetary Benefits Act\n\nThis bill addresses certain federal benefits for surviving spouses of members of the Armed Forces, including those who have remarried.\n\nFor purposes of noncompetitive appointment to government employment, a surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces who was married to such member at the time they died while on active duty may be appointed as a military spouse, regardless of remarriage. Additionally, widows or widowers of certain veterans who served on active duty must be considered preference eligible for purposes of government employment, regardless of remarriage.\n\nA surviving spouse who is eligible for the gold star lapel button is entitled to commissary and exchange privileges to the same extent and on the same basis as the surviving spouse of a retired member of the uniformed services. Such spouses are also entitled, upon request, to medical and dental care provided in facilities of the uniformed services.\n\nA surviving spouse who is eligible for a gold star lapel button must be permitted to use commissary stores and certain retail facilities on the same basis as a dependent of a member of the Armed Forces on active duty.\n\nIn regard to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits, the remarriage of a surviving spouse of a veteran does not bar the furnishing of non-monetary benefits to a surviving spouse who is eligible for a gold star lapel button. Such surviving spouses who are eligible for a gold star lapel button are also eligible for certain VA home loan programs."
