This bill requires each state to provide in each county secured drop boxes at which individuals may drop off their completed absentee ballots for federal elections.

Specifically, the bill requires these drop boxes to be (1) available beginning 45 days before the election; (2) accessible to individuals with disabilities and individuals with limited proficiency in the English language; (3) accessible by public transit; (4) available during all hours of the day; and (5) located in all communities within the county, including rural communities and on tribal lands. States must also post the requirements for absentee ballots to be counted and tabulated in the election.

Further, the bill outlines additional requirements that a state must meet in determining the number and location of drop boxes.</summary>
