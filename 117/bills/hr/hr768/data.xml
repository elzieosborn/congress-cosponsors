This bill creates additional requirements for drug manufacturers and distributors who discover a suspicious order for controlled substances.

In addition to reporting the suspicious order to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), a manufacturer or distributor must also exercise due diligence and decline to fill the order.

The DEA must issue regulations specifying the indicators that give rise to a suspicious order.</summary>
