This bill expands eligibility for trade adjustment assistance, which is federal aid provided to workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages are reduced as a result of increased imports.

Specifically, the bill makes workers of a firm with sales or production that failed to increase or will decrease absolutely due to a scheduled or imminently anticipated, long-term decrease in or reallocation of the production capacity of the firm eligible for trade adjustment assistance. Currently, this assistance is only available if a firm's sales or production have decreased absolutely.</summary>
