 implement a process to hold harmless taxpayers who are identified as having unreported income if those taxpayers believe they are victims of identity theft, or that fraudulent unemployments benefits were claimed in their name; and require states to report the amount of fraudulent unemployment benefits that are excluded as income from Form 1099-G's issued by the state due to suspected or confirmed fraud.</summary>
