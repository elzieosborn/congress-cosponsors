This bill prioritizes U.S. contractors with respect to certain federally funded infrastructure projects.

Specifically, amounts made available through a program for federal financial assistance may be obligated for an infrastructure project with a value of $100 million or more only if the recipient of such amounts certifies that, in obligating the amounts

 subject to the occurrence of adequate competition, the recipient shall award contracts only to U.S. persons and qualified U.S. joint ventures; and the recipient shall not award contracts to an entity that is owned or controlled by a corporation based in a country that has been identified as a nonmarket economy country, was included by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) on the priority watch list, and is subject to certain monitoring by the USTR.</summary>
