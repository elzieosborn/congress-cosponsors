  <summary date="2021-05-18T12:45:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Reporting Accountability and Abuse Prevention Act of 2021

This bill requires recipients of grants for family planning services to demonstrate their compliance with state and local laws that mandate reporting of child abuse, human trafficking, or other mistreatment.

If a grantee does not comply, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must first work with the grantee to remedy violations. For subsequent violations, the bill directs HHS to recoup funds received by the grantee. It also bars the grantee from receiving family planning funds for 36 months.</summary>
