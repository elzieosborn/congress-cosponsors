  <summary date="2022-06-01T18:36:01Z" status="Reported to House">Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism Pilot Program Act of 2022 or the CTPAT Pilot Program Act of 2022

This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to carry out a pilot program that assesses whether allowing certain entities to participate in the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) would enhance port security, combat terrorism, prevent supply chain security breaches, or otherwise satisfy the goals of CTPAT.

Such entities are (1) non-asset-based third-party logistics providers that arrange international freight transportation and are licensed or bonded by specified federal agencies; or (2) asset-based third-party logistics providers that facilitate cross-border activity, are licensed or bonded by specified federal agencies, and execute logistics services using their own warehousing assets and resources.

The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report on the effectiveness of CTPAT.</summary>
