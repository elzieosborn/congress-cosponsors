PFAS are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the EPA to enter into an agreement with NASEM to (1) study and report on research and knowledge gaps identified by the Federal Government Human Health PFAS Research Workshop (October 26 and 27, 2020); and (2) identify research and development needed to identify, categorize, evaluate, and address individual or total PFAS. Additionally, the EPA and other relevant federal agencies must enter into an agreement with NASEM to submit a study and report to better understand the research and development needed to better understand the extent and implications of human and environmental contamination by PFAS and any management and treatment options.\n\nAfter NASEM submits the required reports, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy must submit an implementation plan to Congress for increased collaboration and coordination of federal PFAS research, development, and demonstration activities."
