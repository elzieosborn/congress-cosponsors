This bill directs the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to report to Congress on communications use authorizations (i.e., authorizations to modify or locate communications facilities on public lands).

Specifically, Interior and USDA must (1) provide an assessment on programmatic or administrative barriers to reviewing communications use authorizations, (2) provide an assessment of whether there are rules or regulations that could be revised to improve the efficiency of reviewing communications use authorizations, (3) describe the process for prioritizing the review of communications use authorizations, and (4) provide a plan to ensure adequate staffing to review communications use authorizations in a timely manner.</summary>
