This bill authorizes the President, during an infant formula shortage or potential shortage, to allow the production and marketing or duty-free importation of infant formula that meets specified criteria, regardless of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. The criteria include that the United States has not imposed any sanctions with respect to the manufacturer of the formula and the FDA has not determined that such formula is unsafe.

Further, the President must notify Congress about determinations related to supply shortages of infant formula.</summary>
