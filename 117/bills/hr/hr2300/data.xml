  <summary date="2021-07-19T01:10:51Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill terminates certain executive actions related to immigration.

Specifically, this bill terminates

 an executive order that directs the Bureau of the Census to include in a state's population count each individual whose usual place of residence is in that state, regardless of an individual's immigration status; an executive order that revokes another executive order that prioritized immigration enforcement against certain classes of aliens, such as aliens who have been charged with any criminal offense; and a presidential proclamation that ends the declared emergency pertaining to the U.S.-Mexico border and terminates the authorities used to redirect funds to construct a wall along that border.</summary>
