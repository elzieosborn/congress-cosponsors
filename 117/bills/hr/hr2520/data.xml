This bill requires each local educational agency (LEA) that received federal COVID-19 relief funds to, within 60 days, submit a report to the Department of Education (ED). The bill also requires ED to assess the impact of school closures due to COVID-19.

Specifically, the LEA must report on each elementary or secondary school that did not reopen for full-time, in-person learning as of April 5, 2021. The report must include the reasons why the school did not reopen in accordance with specified guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the expected date for return to full-time, in-person learning. In addition, the report must include the total amount of federal COVID-19 relief funds received by the LEA.

Upon receiving the information from LEAs, ED must assess and report on the effects of school closures due to COVID-19. The assessment must include (1) the long-term effects of extended e-learning and hybrid learning on students, and (2) the effect of closures on student absenteeism and disciplinary changes.</summary>
