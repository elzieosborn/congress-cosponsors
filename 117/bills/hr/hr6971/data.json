The Department of Education (ED) must assess the effectiveness of the commission in promoting information and media literacy education.\n\nED must also award competitive grants to nonprofits (including institutions of higher education) to develop educational materials, public awareness campaigns, and other programming to promote information and media literacy and combat misinformation and disinformation. Additionally, ED must conduct a study to evaluate information and media literacy among the American public."
