This bill establishes a commission and requires other activities to support information and media literacy education and to prevent misinformation and disinformation.

Specific duties of the commission include (1) implementing a national strategy to promote information and media literacy; and (2) identifying programs and resources on information and media literacy for use in elementary, secondary, and higher education, and adult education programs. The Department of Education (ED) must assess the effectiveness of the commission in promoting information and media literacy education.

ED must also award competitive grants to nonprofits (including institutions of higher education) to develop educational materials, public awareness campaigns, and other programming to promote information and media literacy and combat misinformation and disinformation. Additionally, ED must conduct a study to evaluate information and media literacy among the American public.</summary>
