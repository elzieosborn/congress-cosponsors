    "text": "Debra Nixon Special Needs Trust Inclusion Act\n\nThis bill addresses the administration of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) in relation to Special Needs Trusts. Specifically, the bill authorizes retirees who previously elected not to participate in the SBP due to not having a spouse or dependent child to later enroll if they establish a Special Needs Trust. Such retirees must elect to enroll within one year after the date on which the trust is established.\n\nThe bill also authorizes those who have established a Special Needs Trust for certain dependent children to elect to have such trust or child as the beneficiary under the SBP.\n\nDuring the open enrollment period, an individual is authorized to elect to change the beneficiary of an annuity under the SBP to provide coverage for a trust established for a special needs child, a spouse and a trust established for a special needs child, or a former spouse and a trust established for a special needs child."
