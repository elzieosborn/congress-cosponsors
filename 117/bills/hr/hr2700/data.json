The application must demonstrate, among other requirements, that the IHE is operated by one or more nonprofit corporations or associations. Before approving the conversion, ED must publish the application in the Federal Register for notice and comment. Upon approval, the IHE must be regulated as a for-profit IHE for a five-year transition period.\n\nED must also establish an office to carry out the requirements of this bill."
