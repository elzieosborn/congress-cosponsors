Current law prohibits recipients from expending more than 15% of funds on such activities.\n\nThe bill also directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to allow recipients to provide emergency grant payments on behalf of eligible families for up to six months. Currently, these payments, which provide assistance with housing, utilities, or other subsistence support, are limited to three months."
