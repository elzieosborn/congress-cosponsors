This bill addresses the racial equity of publicly traded companies. Specifically, the bill requires certain publicly traded companies to regularly audit the company's ties to slavery and the company's policies and practices on civil rights, equity, diversity, and inclusion. The bill also establishes the Office of Reparations Programs within the Department of the Treasury to provide grants to further racial equity, including for startup capital and funded savings programs for Black communities.</summary>
