This bill requires courts to expedite the disposition of certain covered civil actions in which the President is a party. The bill also provides for expedited direct appeals of these cases to the Supreme Court.

A covered civil action is an action in which the President either has a personal financial interest or is alleged to have committed sexual misconduct, the President is properly joined as a party, and the complainant has a valid claim upon which relief may be granted.</summary>
