Such a discharge is not considered income for tax or other purposes. Additionally, the bill prohibits the automatic default of a private education loan due to the disability of a loan cosigner.\n\nFurthermore, the bill generally permits the discharge of student loans in bankruptcy. Under current law, student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless repayment would be an undue hardship to the debtor and the debtor's dependents."
