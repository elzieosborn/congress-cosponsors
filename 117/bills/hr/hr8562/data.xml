This bill authorizes Congress to nullify the President's invocation of authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 by enacting a joint resolution disapproving of the invocation. It also outlines procedures for the consideration of the joint resolution.

(The Defense Production Act of 1950 confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.)</summary>
