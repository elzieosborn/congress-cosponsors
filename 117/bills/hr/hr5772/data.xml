This bill authorizes grants and requires other activities to address neurological and psychiatric illnesses associated with COVID-19 infection.

Specifically, the National Science Foundation may award competitive grants for multidisciplinary research on such illnesses.

In addition, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy must establish a temporary interagency working group to coordinate relevant federal programs, data collection, and other activities focused on neurological and psychiatric illnesses associated with COVID-19 infection. The working group must also engage with researchers and nonfederal stakeholders to ensure the sharing and dissemination of relevant research, information, and best practices pertaining to those illnesses. The working group terminates after five years.</summary>
