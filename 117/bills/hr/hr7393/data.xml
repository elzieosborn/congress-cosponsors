  <summary date="2022-04-15T14:24:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving VA Workforce Diversity Through Minority-serving Institutions Act of 2022

This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop plans for hiring and recruiting diverse candidates.

Specifically, the VA must develop and carry out an employee recruitment strategy that includes partnering with minority-serving institutions.

The VA must also develop and carry out a plan to ensure that (1) vacant positions may be filled from a candidate pool that includes diverse leaders and diverse candidates identified for promotion; and (2) such positions must be filled using promotion panels comprised of diverse evaluators, reviewers, or assessors.

Additionally, the VA may establish a program, in coordination with minority-serving professional organizations, to foster and encourage individuals from underserved communities to serve in the Senior Executive Service of the VA.</summary>
