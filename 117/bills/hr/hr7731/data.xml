This bill requires information to be provided to the public about the risks associated with the improper use of gasoline containing 15% ethanol by volume, commonly known as E 15 fuel, in certain vehicles, engines, and equipment.

Specifically, the bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise labeling requirements for fuel pumps that dispense E 15 fuel, including by requiring the labels of such fuel pumps to include additional details. The labels must include warning information about vehicles, engines, and equipment (e.g., boats, lawn mowers, chain saws, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and pre-2001 model year vehicles) that are prohibited from using E 15.

In addition, the EPA must implement a public education campaign concerning the risks associated with the improper use of E 15 fuel in such vehicles, engines, and equipment.

The EPA must also withdraw the proposed rule titled E 15 Fuel Dispenser Labeling and Compatibility With Underground Storage Tanks.</summary>
