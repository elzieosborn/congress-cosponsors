The labels must include warning information about vehicles, engines, and equipment (e.g., boats, lawn mowers, chain saws, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and pre-2001 model year vehicles) that are prohibited from using E 15.\n\nIn addition, the EPA must implement a public education campaign concerning the risks associated with the improper use of E 15 fuel in such vehicles, engines, and equipment.\n\nThe EPA must also withdraw the proposed rule titled E 15 Fuel Dispenser Labeling and Compatibility With Underground Storage Tanks."
