This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to admit certain aliens for lawful permanent residence if the alien is the spouse, parent, or guardian of a U.S. citizen.

Qualifying aliens shall be those who were removed from the United States before the bill's enactment, or are subject to a removal order or in removal proceedings on the bill's enactment date. A qualifying alien shall also (1) be of good moral character; (2) not be deportable or inadmissible for various grounds, including those related to health or having been convicted of certain crimes; (3) not have participated in the persecution of any person on account of characteristics such as race, religion, or nationality; and (4) not have been convicted for certain crimes under federal or state law where the maximum sentence was more than one year. DHS may waive the requirement relating to a conviction for a state or federal crime and other specified requirements for humanitarian, family unity, or public interest purposes.

For an alien subject to a removal order or under removal proceedings, the alien must have been continuously physically present in the United States for the four years before the bill's enactment date.</summary>
