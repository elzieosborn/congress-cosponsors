  <summary date="2021-05-27T17:07:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Investing in Community Healing Act of 2021

This bill requires, with a focus on racial and ethnic minority groups, research on adverse health impacts associated with violent interactions with law enforcement and additional activities to promote access to mental and behavioral health care.

Specifically, the Office of Minority Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must research the health consequences of trauma related to violent interactions with law enforcement.

In addition, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must award grants to community-based programs or organizations to increase access to trauma-support services and mental health care.

The Department of Health and Human Services must also carry out a campaign to raise awareness of, and reduce stigma associated with, mental and behavioral health conditions.</summary>
