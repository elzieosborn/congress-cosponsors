This bill requires tax-exempt charitable organizations to disclose in annual reports contributions and gifts exceeding $50,000 received from foreign governments and foreign political parties. The reports must disclose the names of such governments and political parties and the aggregate amounts of contributions and gifts.

The bill requires the Department of the Treasury to make publicly available in a searchable database information on gifts and contributions received from foreign governments and political parties and the aggregate amount received in each year from (1) China, the Chinese Communist Party and its officials, and state-owned Chinese entities; (2) Russia, Russian officials, and state-owned Russian entities; and (3) persons identified pursuant to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN) Human Readable Lists.

Treasury must also report on the foreign influence of tax-exempt organizations with a focus on the role of foreign influence in the funding of such organizations to influence the U.S. energy sector or aid terrorist groups in a conflict zone.</summary>
