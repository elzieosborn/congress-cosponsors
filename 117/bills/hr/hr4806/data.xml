This bill establishes requirements related to U.S. cooperation with International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) communications.

Specifically, no U.S. agency or department may extradite an individual based solely on an INTERPOL notice.

In addition, the Department of Justice and the Department of State must take certain actions to support reforms to increase transparency of INTERPOL, including with respect to its communications.

The bill also requires reports on countries that abuse INTERPOL communications for political motives and other unlawful purposes.</summary>
