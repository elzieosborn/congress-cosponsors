The executive orders, dated April 19, 2021, and August 24, 2021, impose sanctions for certain activities including (1) efforts by Russia's government to undermine U.S. elections and democratic institutions, and (2) the construction of specified Russian energy pipelines.

The determination must also state whether the President has imposed or intends to impose sanctions on any person described in such a request from Congress.</summary>
