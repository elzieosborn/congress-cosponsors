This bill makes an employer of a law enforcement officer acting under color of law vicariously liable, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private employer is liable for the negligent acts of its employees, for that officer's acts or omissions committed within the scope of employment that deprive individuals of their constitutional rights.

The bill prohibits the assertion of a claim of immunity in such actions against law enforcement officers.</summary>
