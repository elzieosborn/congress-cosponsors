This bill prohibits the Federal Trade Commission from adopting any order, decision, report, or action by vote at a meeting unless it publishes on its website the text of such order, decision, report or action not later than 30 days before the vote is to occur (except when an emergency requires publication less than 30 days before the vote). The bill allows an exemption from this publication requirement if it would result in the disclosure of certain confidential information.</summary>
