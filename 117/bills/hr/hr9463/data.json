    "text": "Satellite And Telecommunications Streamlining Act of 2022 or the SAT Streamlining Act of 2022\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Communications Commission to revise its regulations that govern licenses and grants of U.S. market access (and renewals and modifications of such licenses and grants) for geostationary and nongeostationary orbital satellites. Geostationary orbital satellites maintain a stationary position in orbit while nongeostationary satellites move in relation to the Earth's surface. These satellites may be used to provide broadband and other telecommunications services.\n\nMatters that must be addressed in the regulations include deadlines for decisions regarding the licenses or grants of market access, space safety and orbital debris, and sharing of the electromagnetic spectrum band by licensees and grantees."
