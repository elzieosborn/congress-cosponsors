It shall be the lead federal facility dedicated to defending the United States against biological threats.\n\nThe NBACC may include the National Bioforensic Analysis Center and the National Biological Threat Characterization Center.\n\nThe NBACC shall engage in specified activities, including\n\n conducting studies and experiments to better understand current and future biological threats and hazards and pandemics; providing the scientific data required to assess vulnerabilities, conduct risk assessments, and determine potential impacts to guide the development of countermeasures; conducting and facilitating the technical forensic analysis and interpretation of materials recovered following a biological attack, or in other law enforcement investigations requiring evaluation of biological materials, in support of the appropriate lead federal agency; and coordinating with other national laboratories to enhance research capabilities, share lessons learned, and provide training more efficiently. The NBACC must\n\n engage in a continuously operating Work for Others program to make the unique biocontainment and bioforensic capabilities of the NBACC available to other federal agencies; and perform regularly scheduled and required maintenance of laboratory infrastructure, and procure mission-critical equipment and capability upgrades. The Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology shall conduct a mission needs assessment of the NBACC."
