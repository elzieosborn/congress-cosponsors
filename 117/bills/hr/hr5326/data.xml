  <summary date="2022-06-08T19:10:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Chinese Military and Surveillance Company Sanctions Act of 2021

This bill requires the President to impose property-blocking sanctions on Communist Chinese military companies upon certain findings.

Specifically, if the President determines that imposing sanctions on a foreign person would address certain threats related to the financing of Chinese Communist military companies, the President must impose sanctions on that person provided that the person is identified (1) as a Communist Chinese military company in a specified report to Congress or in a November 17, 2020, executive order, or (2) by the Department of the Treasury as having engaged in transactions in the publicly traded securities (or derivatives) of a Communist Chinese military company.</summary>
