  <summary date="2022-09-14T16:08:44Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill revises requirements related to voter removal programs.

Currently, each state must conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of (1) the death of the voter, or (2) a change in the residence of the voter. A state may meet this requirement by establishing a program under which change-of-address information is provided by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). This bill removes the ability of states to rely on this change-of-address information provided by the USPS for the purpose of removing the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters.</summary>
