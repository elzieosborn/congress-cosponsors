  <summary date="2022-08-15T16:33:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Funding Affordable Internet with Reliable Contributions Act or the FAIR Contributions Act

This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to study and report on the feasibility of funding the Universal Service Fund through contributions from edge providers (i.e., providers of online content or services, such as search engines).

The fund provides support to high-cost areas, schools and libraries, rural health care facilities, and the Lifeline program (an FCC program that provides a discount on phone service for low-income consumers).

The report must consider (1) the type and size of firms and services on which contributions could be assessed, (2) equity issues related to current versus alternative systems for contributing to the fund, (3) the effect of any change to the contribution system on the telecommunications bills of consumers, and (4) the sustainability of the fund and how to ensure that fund disbursements are consistent and predictable over time.</summary>
