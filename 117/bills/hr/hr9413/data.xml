  <summary date="2023-02-24T19:11:15Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill revises requirements related to registration statements submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). First, the bill requires an emerging growth company to submit profit and loss statements from the previous 2 years, rather than the previous 3 years as under current law. In addition, the bill allows an issuer of securities to submit a draft registration statement to the SEC for confidential review prior to a public filing.</summary>
