The bill requires any action taken by USADA to enforce a policy, procedure, or requirement against a person with respect to a violation of federal law, including an investigation, disciplinary action, sanction, or any other administrative action, to be carried out in a manner that provides due process protection.\n\nThe Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Food and Drug Administration\u00a0must provide to USADA information relating to the prevention of the use of performance-enhancing drugs or the prohibition of performance-enhancing methods."
