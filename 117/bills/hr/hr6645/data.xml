This bill makes various changes to federal requirements that apply to growing hemp, including requirements related to the permitted amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and hemp testing in laboratories. The bill also allows individuals who have been convicted of certain drug-related felonies to obtain hemp licenses, which is currently prohibited for 10 years after the conviction.</summary>
