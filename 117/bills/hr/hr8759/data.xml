This bill renames the DHS Volunteer Force of the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department of Homeland Security as the DHS Mission Support Force. It also requires new employees of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to serve in a 30-day detail with U.S. Customs and Border Protection or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assist with immigration proceedings at the southern border; the bill applies to new IRS employees who are hired as a result of recent funding increases for IRS enforcement activities.</summary>
