This bill requires the Department of State to provide an annual report to Congress on ties between criminal gangs and political and economic elites in Haiti. Among other things, the report must (1) identify prominent criminal gangs in Haiti, (2) list Haitian political and economic elites that have links to criminal gangs, (3) assess how collusion between Haitian political and economic elites and criminal gangs threatens the Haitian people and U.S. national interests, and (4) assess what actions the governments of the United States and Haiti could take to address those threats.

The bill also requires the State Department to identify certain individuals listed in the report who may be subject to visa- and property-blocking sanctions under specified U.S. laws.</summary>
