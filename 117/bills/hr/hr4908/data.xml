  <summary date="2022-07-06T12:42:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Community Vehicle Charging Act of 2021

This bill establishes a grant program to expand access to electric vehicle infrastructure in communities that consist primarily of minority, low-income, or tribal populations that experience (or are at risk of experiencing) greater adverse human health or environmental effects than other populations.

The Department of Transportation must award the grants to

 community-based organizations; nonprofits; state, tribal, regional, or local governments; metropolitan planning organizations; or other entities responsible for local transportation planning and projects. Grant funds may be used for projects that include (1) developing or implementing plans to install publicly available electric vehicle charging infrastructure, (2) supporting shared electric mobility and micro-mobility options (e.g., electric bicycles), and (3) providing electric vehicle chargers and funding for their installation to community residents.</summary>
