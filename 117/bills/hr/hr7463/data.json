The President may issue a proclamation of such a crisis that specifies the geographic area covered and how long the proclamation applies.\n\nThe bill provides for enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and imposes enhanced civil penalties and criminal fines. It also authorizes state attorneys general to bring a civil action to enforce the prohibitions of this bill."
