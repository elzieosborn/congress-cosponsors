It limits the tax liability of such taxpayers to 35% of the amount by which their net worth exceeds $100 million at the end of the taxable year.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service must annually audit taxpayers whose net worth exceeds $100 million in the current taxable year and any of the 3 preceding taxable years and impose a penalty of 20% of understatements of tax (40% if understatements are due to failure to report an asset).\n\nThe bill establishes the Family Investment Trust Fund to hold tax revenues generated by this bill for programs to support family well-being and the development of children."
