    "text": "Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs Act or the LEAP Act\n\n This bill allows employers a business-related tax credit of $1,500 for hiring an apprenticeship employee who has not attained age 25 at the close of the taxable year or $1,000 for an apprenticeship employee who has attained age 25.\n\nThe bill allows the credit for no more than two taxable years with respect to any apprenticeship employee. An apprenticeship employee is an employee who is employed in an officially-recognized apprenticeable occupation pursuant to an apprentice agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship of the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor or a state apprenticeship agency.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget must coordinate with federal departments and independent agencies to (1) determine which government publications could be available on government websites and no longer printed, (2) devise a strategy to reduce overall government printing costs over the 10-year period beginning with FY2020, (3) establish government-wide guidelines on employee printing, and (4) issue guidelines for publicly disclosing information about the publication of government documents."
