This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to prioritize projects in rural areas when awarding grants for demonstration projects that provide education and training to low-income individuals for health care occupations.

Specifically, HHS must give preference to projects that (1) serve a rural area where project participants reside, the project is conducted, or an employer partnership commits to hiring project participants; and (2) provide project participants with transportation assistance.</summary>
