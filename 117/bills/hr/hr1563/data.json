It also extends provisions specific to California, including drought relief and the operations of the Central Valley Project (a hydropower and water management project in California that is operated by Reclamation).\n\nFurther, the bill extends through 2033 consultation requirements concerning biological assessments and the coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project in California."
