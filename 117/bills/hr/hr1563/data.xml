  <summary date="2021-05-20T13:06:20Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill extends the authority of certain federal agencies to provide support for western water infrastructure and extends consultation requirements concerning projects in California.

Specifically, the bill extends through 2028 the authority of the Bureau of Reclamation to provide support for projects in certain western states related to federal or state-led water storage, water desalination, and water recycling and reuse. It also extends provisions specific to California, including drought relief and the operations of the Central Valley Project (a hydropower and water management project in California that is operated by Reclamation).

Further, the bill extends through 2033 consultation requirements concerning biological assessments and the coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project in California.</summary>
