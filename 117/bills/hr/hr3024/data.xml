  <summary date="2022-02-04T16:54:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Zero-Percent Student Loan Refinancing Act

This bill establishes a temporary program through which the Department of Education (ED) must make interest-free refinancing loans to borrowers of federal student loans from August 1, 2021, through December 31, 2024.

The bill requires ED to automatically refinance Federal Direct Loans and notify each borrower of the refinancing.

Borrowers who have other types of eligible loans (i.e., Federal Family Education Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, and certain health profession and nursing loans) must apply for refinancing. ED and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must carry out a campaign to notify borrowers of these types of loans that they are eligible to apply for refinancing under the program.</summary>
