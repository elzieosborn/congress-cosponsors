This bill authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA), upon a determination that the amount of its commitments to guarantee 504 loans could exceed the authorized limit, to guarantee up to 115% of that limit. Such loans, made through SBA community partners and certified by the SBA, provide long-term, fixed rate financing for major fixed assets that promote business growth and job creation.</summary>
