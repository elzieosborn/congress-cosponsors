    "text": "Helping America's Farmers Act\n\nThis bill provides financial assistance to certain agricultural entities.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs the Farm Service Agency (FSA) of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to carry out a program to provide economic disaster loans to certain agricultural entities with an adjusted gross income of less than or equal to $500,000. Under the program, such entities are eligible for zero-interest loans of up to $2 million and may seek loan forgiveness based on demonstrated economic hardship.In making loans, priority must be given to (1) entities located in states most impacted by an economic disaster; and (2) minority, veteran, and women farmers and ranchers.\n\nThe FSA may also guarantee a loan to certain agricultural entities with an adjusted gross income of greater than $500,000 if such loan meets certain requirements.\n\nEntities that apply for a loan or loan guarantee may request that the FSA provide an emergency grant of at least $20,000 upon application.\n\nThe bill also provides funding for USDA to carry out a program to provide FSA staff with appropriate training relating to economic injury loan processing and servicing."
