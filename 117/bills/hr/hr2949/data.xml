  <summary date="2021-10-22T19:40:48Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill exempts certain contracts from periodic inflation adjustments to the acquisition-related dollar threshold.

Current law establishes dollar thresholds related to acquisition spending by federal agencies and it requires those thresholds to be adjusted every five years for inflation. The bill exempts certain contracts (e.g., contracts of more than $100,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the federal government) from this adjustment.</summary>
