The bill also prohibits such personnel from lobbying on behalf of foreign entities, including foreign corporations, at any time after their employment ends. Currently, senior and very senior personnel may not lobby agencies for one year and two years post-employment, respectively, and may not lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political parties for one year post-employment."
