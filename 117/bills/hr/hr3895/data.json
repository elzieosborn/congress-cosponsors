    "text": "College Athlete Right to Organize Act\n\nThis bill establishes collective bargaining rights for college athletes.\n\nSpecifically, the bill amends the National Labor Relations Act to (1) define college athlete employee as an employee of an institution of higher education if the individual receives direct compensation from the institution and such compensation requires participation in intercollegiate sports, and (2) include public institutions as employers within the context of intercollegiate sports.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) must consider the colleges within an athletic conference as part of a bargaining unit with which college athletes can negotiate.\n\nThe NLRB shall have jurisdiction over all institutions of higher education within the context of intercollegiate athletics regarding collective bargaining and representation matters and labor disputes.\n\nThe bill prohibits any agreements, such as scholarship agreements, that waive the right of athletes to collectively bargain."
