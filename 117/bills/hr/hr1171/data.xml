This bill generally revises disclosure requirements for political advertisements.

First, the bill applies political advertising disclosure requirements currently applicable to candidates (also known as stand by your ad requirements) to entities such as corporations and certain political committees. Political advertisements made by these entities must generally disclose the top funders of the entity, with specified exceptions.

In addition, the bill revises the classification of certain media, including audio and visual media, for purposes of disclaimer requirements. It also expands the definition of communication to include prerecorded telephone calls.

Finally, the bill creates additional readability and audio requirements for communications.</summary>
