Political advertisements made by these entities must generally disclose the top funders of the entity, with specified exceptions.\n\nIn addition, the bill revises the classification of certain media, including audio and visual media, for purposes of disclaimer requirements. It also expands the definition of communication to include prerecorded telephone calls.\n\nFinally, the bill creates additional readability and audio requirements for communications."
