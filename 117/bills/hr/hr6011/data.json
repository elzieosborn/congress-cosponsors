A covered good may not be introduced for sale in the United States unless the domestic value content of the good is more than 50%, with limited exceptions. The President may waive this requirement under specified circumstances.\n\nFurther, the bill establishes enforcement provisions, including civil penalties and investigations by the U.S. International Trade Commission."
