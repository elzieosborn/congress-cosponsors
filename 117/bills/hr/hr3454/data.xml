This bill requires the Securities&#160;and Exchange Commission to allow issuers of securities traded on a national securities exchange to meet quarterly financial disclosure requirements via an alternative method, such as through a press release or a shortened form. (Currently, such issuers must disclose information quarterly through Form 10-Q.)</summary>
