  <summary date="2022-10-17T20:37:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal Agency Climate Planning, Resilience, and Enhanced Preparedness Act of 2021 or the Federal Agency Climate PREP Act

This bill requires executive agencies to develop plans to address, mitigate, and adapt to climate change. Specifically, each executive agency (except for the Government Accountability Office) must submit to the Office of Management and Budget an agency climate action plan. In addition, the bill establishes a Council on Federal Agency Climate Planning, Resilience, and Enhanced Preparedness. Finally, the bill provides statutory authority for the establishment of the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, which was created by Executive Order 14008.</summary>
