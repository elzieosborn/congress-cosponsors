Under this bill, these sanctions must also apply to any foreign person that engaged in any transaction with such sanctioned persons.\n\nThe bill also reinstates any sanctions that were previously waived with respect to Nord Stream 2 AG (the company established to construct and operate the pipeline) or any of its corporate officers. Such reinstated sanctions may not be waived except by an act of Congress."
