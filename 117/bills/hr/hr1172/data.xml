This bill treats certain payments for coordinated expenditures as campaign contributions for purposes of disclosure and reporting requirements.

First, the bill generally defines a coordinated expenditure as a payment made by any person in cooperation with a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, a political committee of a political party, or an agent of a candidate or committee. Further, the bill sets forth penalties for willfully violating limits related to making contributions to a candidate for coordinated expenditures.

The bill also prohibits a candidate or an individual holding federal office from soliciting, receiving, directing, or transferring funds to or on behalf of certain types of political committees.</summary>
