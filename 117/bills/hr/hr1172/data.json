Further, the bill sets forth penalties for willfully violating limits related to making contributions to a candidate for coordinated expenditures.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a candidate or an individual holding federal office from soliciting, receiving, directing, or transferring funds to or on behalf of certain types of political committees."
