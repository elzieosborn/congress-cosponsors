    "text": "This bill treats certain price protection payments from Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) as eligible rollover distributions (i.e., tax-free distributions from a qualified retirement plan to another eligible plan). Price protection payments are made under a price protection agreement and provide a guaranteed minimum price for shares that may temporarily decline in value as a result of loans to the ESOP to purchase shares.\n\nThe bill treats price protection payments made after December 12, 2019, for plan years ending before January 1, 2023, as eligible rollover distributions if payments were made pursuant to a price protection agreement for distributions due to separation from service, retirement, death or disability. For plan years beginning after 2022, payments made under a price protection agreement as a result of any separation of service of a plan participant (regardless of the reason for such separation) would be eligible for rollover."
