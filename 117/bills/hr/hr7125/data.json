(The program works with foreign countries to address the risks from weapons of mass destruction, including by securing such weapons and detecting the spread of especially dangerous pathogens.)\n\nSpecifically, the program may not engage in (1) cooperative biological engagement; or (2) activities for facilitating the detection and reporting of diseases that could be used as an early warning detection mechanism for outbreaks, regardless of whether such diseases are caused by biological weapons."
