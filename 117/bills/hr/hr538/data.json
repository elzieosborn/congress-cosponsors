It also extends for five additional years the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund.\n\nUnder current law, the program compensates, among others, individuals who were present in a designated geographic area during a period of nuclear testing. The bill expands that area to include all parts of Clark County, Nevada, and Mohave County, Arizona. Current law restricts eligibility to certain parts of those counties."
