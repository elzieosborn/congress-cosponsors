  <summary date="2023-08-05T00:55:50Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill generally prohibits the use of federal funds, including funds from the federal Judgment Fund, for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel by a privately owned facility.

The prohibition does not apply to (1) manufacturers of nuclear reactors or fabricators of nuclear fuel that accept the return of spent nuclear fuel, (2) nuclear power plants that accept spent nuclear fuel for interim storage, or (3) privately owned interim storage facilities that are currently in operation. Funds may also be used for costs associated with transferring or storing spent nuclear fuel at sites owned by the Department of Energy.</summary>
