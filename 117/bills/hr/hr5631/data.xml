  <summary date="2022-05-04T17:16:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Tim Hart Wildland Firefighter Classification and Pay Parity Act or Tim's Act

This bill addresses the pay and benefits of federal wildland firefighters and related issues. Federal wildland firefighter is defined as any temporary, seasonal, or permanent position at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Department of the Interior that maintains certain group, emergency incident management, or fire qualifications and primarily engages in or supports wildland fire management activities.

Specifically, (1) the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must establish one or more classification series for federal wildland firefighter positions, and (2) USDA and the Department of the Interior shall determine each position within USDA and Interior that qualifies as a federal wildland firefighter position.

The bill, among other requirements (1) establishes a pay scale for such positions, with annual adjustments; and (2) provides for hazardous duty pay. The OPM must establish guidelines for work schedules.

The bill addresses issues regarding wages, unpaid leave to care for a family member, recruitment and retention bonuses, and housing allowances.

USDA and Interior shall (1) establish, maintain, coordinate, and operate a voluntary tuition assistance program; (2) establish and maintain a publicly accessible, searchable Federal Wildland Firefighter Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease Database; and (3) establish and carry out a program for mental health awareness and support.

Additionally, the bill provides for continuation of firefighters pension coverage in case of disability and pay parity for federal structural firefighters.</summary>
