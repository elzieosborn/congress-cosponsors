The President must confiscate the property and accounts of such sanctioned individuals that come within U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nThe bill also requires a U.S. financial institution to take all necessary and available actions to ensure any entity or person owned or controlled by such institution complies with financial sanctions applicable to Russia or Belarus to the same extent required of that institution."
