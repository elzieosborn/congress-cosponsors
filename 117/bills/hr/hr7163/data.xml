  <summary date="2023-08-09T13:45:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Sanctioning Putin's Enablers Act 

This bill requires the President to impose sanctions on certain individuals involved in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including Russian legislators who voted to authorize the invasion and certain officials of Belarus who orchestrated the constitutional referendum that permitted Belarus to permanently host Russia's nuclear weapons. The President must confiscate the property and accounts of such sanctioned individuals that come within U.S. jurisdiction.

The bill also requires a U.S. financial institution to take all necessary and available actions to ensure any entity or person owned or controlled by such institution complies with financial sanctions applicable to Russia or Belarus to the same extent required of that institution.</summary>
