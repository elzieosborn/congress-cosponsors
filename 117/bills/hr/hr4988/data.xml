  <summary date="2022-07-12T18:47:26Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits congressional budget resolutions from including reconciliation instructions that would cause a net increase in the deficit for the period of fiscal years covered by the resolution.

(Reconciliation instructions generally direct congressional committees to report legislation to achieve certain budgetary goals by changing laws that affect spending, revenue, or the debt limit. The legislation is then considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures, which limit debate and amendments.)</summary>
