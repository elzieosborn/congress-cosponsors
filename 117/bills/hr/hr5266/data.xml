  <summary date="2022-03-24T21:26:20Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires each federal research agency with an annual extramural research expenditure of over $100 million to establish a requirement that, as part of an application for a research and development award from the agency

 each covered individual listed on the application for a research and development award certify that they have completed research security training that meets the training guidelines developed pursuant to the authority of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) under this bill, and each institution of higher education or other organization applying for such an award certify that each covered individual who is employed by the institution or organization and listed on the application has been made aware of such requirement. The OSTP must develop guidelines for institutions of higher education and other organizations receiving federal research and development funds for use in developing their own training programs to address their unique needs, challenges, and risk profiles, including the adoption of training modules developed under this bill.

The OSTP shall enter into an agreement or contract with a qualified entity for the development of online research security training modules for the research community, including modules focused on international collaboration and international travel, foreign interference, and rules for proper use of funds, disclosure, conflict of commitment, and conflict of interest.</summary>
