  <summary date="2022-05-06T14:14:51Z" status="Passed House">Ukraine Religious Freedom Support Act

This bill directs the President, when determining whether Russia is a country of particular concern for religious freedom under certain federal laws, to consider incidents occurring in the parts of Ukraine that Russia (or any Russia-affiliated non-state group) occupies, controls, or recognizes as independent. (The United States may take certain actions, such as withdrawing development assistance, against a country of particular concern for religious freedom.)</summary>
