  <summary date="2021-04-16T19:54:43Z" status="Introduced in House">Emergency Funding for Child Protection Act This bill funds additional grants to states for child abuse or neglect prevention and treatment programs in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Specifically, states may use such grants to expand services, provide support to community-based organizations, purchase emergency supplies, and provide temporary direct payments to families caring for children under protective services supervision that are awaiting approval for government assistance, among other uses. The bill does not require states to match funding under these grants.

The bill also provides funding to operate and expand the national child abuse hotline.</summary>
