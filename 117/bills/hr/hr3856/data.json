Additionally, the study must assess whether there is any relationship between such disparities associated with race and ethnicity and other demographic characteristics such as gender and age. The GAO must also develop recommendations to facilitate better data collection on such disparities associated with race and ethnicity.\n\nWithin one year, the GAO must brief Congress on the initial results of the study. The GAO must also submit a final report on the study following the briefing."
