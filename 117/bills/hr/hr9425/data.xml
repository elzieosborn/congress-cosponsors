This bill revokes the security clearance of a family member or financial associate of the President that was granted contrary to the determination or recommendation of an agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent background investigation and agency adjudication is required before such an individual may be granted a security clearance.

In addition, the White House Chief of Staff must notify Congress if the President or any other individual grants a security clearance to a family member or financial associate of the President contrary to the determination or recommendation of an agency. The notification must be made in writing no later than five days after the decision to grant the clearance.</summary>
