This bill establishes procedural requirements related to the custodial interrogation of a minor.

Among the requirements, the custodial interrogation of a minor must comply with the following:

 an arresting officer must notify the minor's parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the arrest and provide the location where the minor is being detained; and a minor who is subject to a custodial interrogation must consult with legal counsel in person before waiving the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to counsel. If a custodial interrogation does not comply with the requirements, then a statement by a minor during the custodial interrogation and any evidence derived from that statement are inadmissible.</summary>
