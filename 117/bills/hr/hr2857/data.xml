This bill revises federal laws governing civil asset forfeiture.

Specifically, the bill makes various changes to the general rules governing civil forfeiture proceedings. Among the changes, the bill

 requires counsel for an indigent property owner regardless of whether the owner requests counsel, raises the evidentiary standard from preponderance of the evidence to clear and convincing evidence, and sets forth factors courts must consider in determining whether a forfeiture of facilitating property is excessive. Additionally, the bill eliminates statutory authority for equitable sharing and directs forfeiture proceeds to be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury instead of the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund.

Finally, the bill makes changes with respect to the civil forfeiture of money involved in structuring offenses (i.e., structuring currency transactions to evade currency reporting requirements). Among the changes, the bill

 specifies an evidentiary standard of knowingly for structuring offenses, and requires a prompt probable cause hearing following the seizure of money involved in a structuring offense.</summary>
