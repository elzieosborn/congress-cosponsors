This bill revises the methodology for apportioning federal highway funds among states. Specifically, the bill adjusts each state's apportionment to account for both certain tax payments attributable to highway users in&#160;the state and other federal taxes collected&#160;in&#160;the state relative to such taxes collected in all states. The bill also caps the apportionment that each state may receive.</summary>
