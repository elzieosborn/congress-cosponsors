This bill excludes health care providers from federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare) and federally funded state health care programs (e.g., Medicaid) for one year if they fail to furnish services to a patient based on the patient's political statements. Providers are subject to two-year exclusions for actions that cause a patient to be in violation of a public health emergency.</summary>
