This bill makes changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Among these changes, the bill (1) directs the Department of Education to provide partial loan forgiveness to a borrower for every 12 months of qualifying payments and employment, and (2) makes additional loan types (e.g., Federal Family Education Loans and Perkins Loans) eligible for forgiveness under the PSLF program.</summary>
