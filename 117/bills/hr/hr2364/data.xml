This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide education and training related to synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and its analogues.

Specifically, HHS must launch a public education campaign on the dangers of synthetic opioids and related issues.

HHS must also produce training materials to prevent exposure to synthetic opioids for first responders and others who are&#160;at high risk of such exposure and disseminate the materials to ambulance transport personnel, local sheriff deputies, and other first responders and individuals in high-risk occupations.</summary>
