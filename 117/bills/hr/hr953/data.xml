This bill establishes a grant program for health departments to assist workplaces in implementing measures to protect essential workers from COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

To carry out this program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must consult with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In addition, the CDC must consult with employers and representatives of essential workers on recommended measures to contain and mitigate COVID-19 and on other aspects of the program.</summary>
