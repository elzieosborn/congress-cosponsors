This bill expands, for immigration purposes, the definition of engaging in terrorist activity to include threatening, attempting, or conspiring to take certain acts considered to be terrorist activity under current law, such as gathering information on potential targets for terrorist activity.

Currently, non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who engage in terrorist activity are barred from admission into the United States.</summary>
