    "text": "Secure Data and Privacy for Contact Tracing Act of 2021\n\nThis bill establishes grants for state, tribal, and territorial health departments to incorporate digital contact tracing technology in COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) contact tracing programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must award the grants.\n\nAny technology developed or procured with these grants must meet privacy, security, and other conditions. Grantees that acquire technology that does not meet these conditions lose eligibility for this, and future, funding for COVID-19 contact tracing technology.\n\nIn addition, federal privacy standards for personal health information expressly apply to information transmitted or maintained by grant-funded programs. Current law restricts the use and disclosure of personal health information by health care providers, health plans, health clearinghouses, and their business associates. However, there is an exception to these standards for information used by, or disclosed to, a public health authority.\n\nThe bill also prohibits the use of data derived from the contact tracing technology in legal proceedings or for immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must evaluate this program."
