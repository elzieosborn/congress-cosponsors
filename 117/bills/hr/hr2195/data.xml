This bill updates employment and reemployment rights of members of the uniformed services by making arbitration requirements unenforceable unless the parties consent to such arbitration in relation to employment or reemployment claims. The bill provides that consent is not voluntary when a person is required to agree to arbitrate an action, complaint, or claim alleging a violation of employment and reemployment rights as a condition of future or continued employment, advancement in employment, or receipt of any right or benefit of employment.</summary>
