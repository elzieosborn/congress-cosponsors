This bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), when submitting recommendations for legislation, to submit an accompanying economic analysis.

The required analysis must demonstrate that (1) the FTC has identified a problem it determines should be addressed (including the FTC's rationale for determining that private markets or public institutions could not address this issue), and (2) the recommended legislation is based on a reasoned determination that the benefits of the recommended legislation outweigh its costs.</summary>
