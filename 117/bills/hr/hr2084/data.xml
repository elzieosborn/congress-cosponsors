This bill provides for the collection of citizenship status information for the population of the United States.

Specifically, the bill directs the Census Bureau to collect statistics on the citizenship status of persons permanently residing in the United States. Further, beginning with the questionnaire for the 2020 decennial census and thereafter, the Census Bureau must include a checkbox or other similar option for the respondent to indicate whether such individual, and each member of that individual's household, is a U.S. citizen or national.

 Additionally, the Department of Commerce must establish the Citizenship Data Interagency Working Group to develop and submit recommendations to maximize the percentage of the U.S. population about which Commerce has citizenship status information.</summary>
