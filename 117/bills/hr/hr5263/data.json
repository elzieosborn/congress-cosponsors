These officials must work with the interagency coordinator to (1) achieve objectives related to anomalous health incidents, and (2) jointly provide quarterly briefings to Congress on its activities.\n\nSuch agencies must also develop updated workplace guidance to address anomalous health incidents.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Department of State to take certain actions, such as increasing staffing for the Health Incident Response Task Force and collecting data related to anomalous health incidents."
