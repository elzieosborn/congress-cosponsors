  <summary date="2022-03-04T19:34:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Disaster Relief Medicaid Act

This bill establishes a series of programs and requirements relating to Medicaid coverage of individuals affected by a federally declared major disaster.

In particular, the bill provides for specific disaster relief coverage under Medicaid for individuals who meet specified income eligibility standards and, during the seven-day period preceding the disaster, were either residents of the impacted area or were employed in the impacted area (and subsequently lost employment). Coverage is effective for two years after the date of the disaster declaration.

State Medicaid programs must provide disaster relief coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the state's Medicaid coverage and the Medicaid coverage of the individual's home state, as applicable. The bill applies a 100% Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) to such coverage and related administrative expenses.</summary>
