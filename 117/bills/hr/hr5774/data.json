The Government Accountability Office must conduct a review on the fiscal controls by states that receive funds under provisions pertaining to public assistance grant program eligibility and oversight for debris removal. The President may not impose additional income criteria on a potential grant recipient who has accepted a qualified disaster loan in determining eligibility for duplications of benefit relief."
