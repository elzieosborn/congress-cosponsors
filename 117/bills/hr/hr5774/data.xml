This bill authorizes the President, after the declaration of a major disaster, to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide to the state assistance necessary for meeting unmet needs as a result of such disaster.

The President may provide financial assistance or direct assistance to individuals or households to construct permanent or semi-permanent housing in insular areas outside the continental United States and in other locations if the President considers it a cost effective alternative to other housing solutions. The Government Accountability Office must conduct a review on the fiscal controls by states that receive funds under provisions pertaining to public assistance grant program eligibility and oversight for debris removal. The President may not impose additional income criteria on a potential grant recipient who has accepted a qualified disaster loan in determining eligibility for duplications of benefit relief.</summary>
