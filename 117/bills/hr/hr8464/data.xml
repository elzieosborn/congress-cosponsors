  <summary date="2022-11-01T15:09:05Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires specified agencies in the executive branch of the federal government to conduct a study on duplicative functions.

Specifically, such agencies (which include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency) must

 identity functions that duplicate the functions of other specified agencies; calculate the annual cost of such duplicative functions; and analyze solutions for eliminating such duplicative functions, including identifying which agency is best suited to have sole responsibility for such functions. Such agencies must jointly submit a consolidated report to Congress on the results.</summary>
