This bill revises requirements concerning the qualifications and responsibilities of the Chief Scientist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Specifically, the bill establishes new minimum qualification requirements for the position of the Chief Scientist. It also outlines new responsibilities of the Chief Scientist. For example, the Chief Scientist must follow NOAA's scientific integrity policies and ensure NOAA's employees and contractors adhere to the policies as well. In addition, the Chief Scientist must (1) provide policy and program direction for the science and technology priorities of NOAA, and (2) manage the Office of the Chief Scientist.</summary>
