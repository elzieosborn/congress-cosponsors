    "text": "This bill revises the Redbank and Fancher Creeks flood control project in California to authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to allow a nonfederal interest to establish conservation pools in the Big Dry Creek Reservoir and the Fancher Creek Reservoir.\n\nUnder this bill, a nonfederal interest that intends to establish a conservation pool must (1) perform any dam safety study that the USACE deems appropriate for determining whether the pool will affect flood protections or injure the public, and (2) submit the plan to the USACE for establishing and engineering the pool so it will not affect flood protections or injure the public.\n\nFor these pools, the USACE may accept and expend funds provided by the nonfederal interest for reviewing any study, engineering, or plan to ensure compliance with federal standards. Further, the USACE may revise the water control manual for the flood control project.\n\nThe bill requires the nonfederal cost share to be 90%."
