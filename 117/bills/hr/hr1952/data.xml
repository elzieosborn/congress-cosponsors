This bill establishes requirements for incorporating passive identification capability into firearms sold in the United States. The term passive identification capability means technology that (1) enables identification by a mobile or fixed reading device, and (2) does not transmit an electronic monitoring or tracking signal.

Additionally, the bill requires a gun owner to report a lost or stolen firearm to local law enforcement authorities within 48 hours of discovery. A gun owner who fails to report a lost or stolen firearm is subject to penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to one year, or both.</summary>
