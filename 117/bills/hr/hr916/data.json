Not more than 1,000 of the positions may be career appointees within the Senior Executive Service.\n\nDOD may offer voluntary separation incentive payments and voluntary early retirement payments to achieve the reductions but must use involuntary measures, beginning at the start of FY2021, to achieve required reductions in personnel levels if voluntary measures are inadequate."
