The bill allows\n\n beneficiaries to continue to receive telehealth services at any site, regardless of type or location (e.g., the beneficiary's home); occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, and audiologists to continue to furnish telehealth services; federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics to continue to serve as the distant site (i.e., the location of the health care practitioner); evaluation and management and behavioral health services to continue to be provided via audio-only technology; and hospice physicians and nurse practitioners to continue to complete certain requirements relating to patient recertifications via telehealth. The bill also delays implementation of certain in-person evaluation requirements for mental health telehealth services until January 1, 2025, or the first day after the end of the emergency period, whichever is later."
