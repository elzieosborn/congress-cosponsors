  <summary date="2022-08-03T17:49:45Z" status="Passed House">Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2022

 This bill modifies the extension of certain Medicare telehealth flexibilities after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency.

Specifically, the bill provides that certain flexibilities continue to apply until December 31, 2024, if the emergency period ends before that date. The bill allows

 beneficiaries to continue to receive telehealth services at any site, regardless of type or location (e.g., the beneficiary's home); occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, and audiologists to continue to furnish telehealth services; federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics to continue to serve as the distant site (i.e., the location of the health care practitioner); evaluation and management and behavioral health services to continue to be provided via audio-only technology; and hospice physicians and nurse practitioners to continue to complete certain requirements relating to patient recertifications via telehealth. The bill also delays implementation of certain in-person evaluation requirements for mental health telehealth services until January 1, 2025, or the first day after the end of the emergency period, whichever is later.</summary>
