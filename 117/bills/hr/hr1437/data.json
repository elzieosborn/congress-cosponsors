(Sec. 104) This section decreases funding for the Medicare Improvement Fund. TITLE II--HUMAN SERVICES (Sec. 201) This section extends and provides additional funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which supports pregnant individuals and parents of young children in certain communities through home visits and partnerships with health, social service, and child development professionals.

TITLE III--EXTENSION OF FDA AUTHORIZATIONS (Sec. 301) This section reauthorizes the Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships, through which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may enter into collaborative agreements with eligible entities to develop projects designed to achieve certain goals, such as fostering medical product innovation and accelerating medical product development. (Sec. 302) This section reauthorizes a National Institutes of Health program to (1) develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, and (2) award funds to entities with expertise in conducting research regarding such needs. (Sec. 303) This section reauthorizes through December 24, 2022, the humanitarian device exemption program, which authorizes the FDA to, for the purposes of an application for approval to market a medical device, waive certain effectiveness requirements for an eligible device designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects no more than 8,000 individuals in the United States. Specifically, a request for such an exemption must be submitted on or before December 24, 2022. (Sec. 304) This section reauthorizes a program that provides grants or contracts to nonprofit consortia for demonstration projects to promote pediatric device development. (Sec. 305) This section reauthorizes until December 24, 2022, a provision that allows an applicant for market approval for an eligible single-enantiomer drug to make an election that may qualify the drug for a five-year market exclusivity period. (Sec. 306) This section extends through December 24, 2022, a provision requiring the FDA to accredit persons to inspect facilities that manufacture certain classes of medical devices. (Sec. 307) This section reauthorizes an FDA program that provides grants to defray the costs of developing drugs, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases or conditions. (Sec. 308) This section reauthorizes a provision requiring the FDA to post on its website quarterly reports with information on received generic drug applications and priority review applications.

DIVISION D--PRECIP ACT Providing Research and Estimates of Changes In Precipitation Act or the PRECIP Act This division directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to take actions regarding precipitation estimation. NOAA must seek to enter an agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study on the state of practice and research needs for precipitation estimation, including probable maximum precipitation estimation. NOAA, in consideration of the study's recommendations, shall consult with relevant partners on the development of a plan to update probable maximum precipitation estimates. NOAA shall develop guidance regarding probable maximum precipitation estimates that (1) provides best practices for federal and state regulatory agencies, private meteorological consultants, and other users that perform probable maximum precipitation studies; (2) considers the recommendations provided in the National Academies study; (3) facilitates review of probable maximum precipitation studies by regulatory agencies; and (4) provides confidence in regional and site-specific probable maximum precipitation estimates."
