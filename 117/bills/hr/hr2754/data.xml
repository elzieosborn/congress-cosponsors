This bill requires multiple agencies to carry out research and other activities concerning individuals experiencing post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, or PASC, including health disparities related to this condition. PASC refers to persistent, long-term symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19.

First, the bill requires the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund to support a patient registry to collect information on the symptoms, treatment, demographics, and other relevant data of COVID-19 patients.

Second, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) must conduct or support research on the U.S. health care system's response to long-term symptoms of COVID-19. AHRQ must also develop protocols and guidance to educate medical professionals about PASC diagnostics, treatment, and care.

Third, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must disseminate information about the common symptoms, treatment options, and disparities that pertain to PASC and related post-infectious illnesses.

Last, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must expand its Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse to collect data on items and services furnished through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program to individuals who experience PASC.</summary>
