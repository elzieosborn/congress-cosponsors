Generally, this exclusivity period begins upon a first applicant's commercial marketing of the drug.\n\nThe bill authorizes the FDA to approve a subsequent generic drug application prior to a first applicant's first date of commercial marketing if (1) the subsequent application is ready for full approval, (2) a first applicant's application has been pending for at least 30 months, and (3) the approval of a first applicant's application is not precluded by patent infringement claims asserted against that first applicant."
