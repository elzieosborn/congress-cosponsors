The platform may avoid such liability by taking certain actions before the infringing act, including (1) requiring the seller to have a registered agent or a verified address for service of process in the United States, (2) verifying the seller's identity and contact information, (3) requiring the seller to agree to not use counterfeit marks with goods sold on the platform, (4) implementing technical measures to prescreen listings on the platform and remove listings for goods being sold with a counterfeit mark, and (5) implementing policies to remove and ban repeat offenders."
