This bill authorizes programs to provide defense-related assistance to Greece and addresses related issues.

The bill authorizes providing to Greece from FY2022-FY2026 (1) assistance through the European Recapitalization Incentive Program to help Greece meet its defense needs and transition away from Russian-produced military equipment; and (2) International Military Education and Training assistance for various purposes, including to train future leaders and to establish rapport between the U.S. Armed Forces and Greece's military.

The President may expedite the delivery of future purchases of F-35 aircraft by Greece.
