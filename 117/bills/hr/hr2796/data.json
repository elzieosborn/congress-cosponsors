    "text": "Family Attribution Modernization Act\n\nThis bill modifies testing rules for tax-exempt pension and profit sharing plans (e.g., 401k retirement plans) to eliminate attribution under the the family attribution rules (1) for spouses with separate businesses who reside in community property states, and (2) between parents with separate businesses who have minor children. The family attribution rule treats an individual taxpayer as owning property interests (e.g., stock) that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the individual's spouse, children, grandchildren, and parents."
