  <summary date="2021-12-10T19:28:59Z" status="Introduced in House">Rural Equal Aid Act 

This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pay the principal, interest, and any associated fees owed on loans made under certain rural development loan programs for a nine-month period.

A single monthly payment of principal, interest, and associated fees with respect to a loan in the last three months of the nine-month period must not exceed $9,000.

USDA must also encourage the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and state bank regulators to not require lenders to increase their reserves on account of receiving such payments made by USDA. USDA must waive statutory limits on maximum loan maturities for certain loan durations where the lender provides a deferral and extends the maturity of such loans and, when necessary to provide more time because of difficulties during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, extend lender site visit requirements.</summary>
