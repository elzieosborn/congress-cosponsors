The bill extends FEMA's authority to implement state-managed housing assistance as a pilot program until the issuance of final regulations. FEMA must conduct a study and develop a plan to address the challenges associated with providing housing assistance to survivors of major disasters or emergencies.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on assistance issues, including improper and potentially fraudulent federal disaster assistance."
