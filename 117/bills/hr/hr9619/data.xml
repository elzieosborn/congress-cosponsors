This bill directs the Department of the Interior to carry out a pilot program to prioritize the use of native plant species within geographically diverse units of the National Park System and public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management.

In carrying out the pilot program, Interior shall

 give preference to the use of locally adapted native plant materials where appropriate; incorporate efforts to prevent, control, or eradicate the spread of invasive species; incorporate efforts to use native plants in areas that have experienced a recent wildfire event; and identify situations in which the use of non-native plants may be warranted.</summary>
