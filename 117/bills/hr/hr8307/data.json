    "text": "Steven's Law\n\nThis bill establishes requirements for collecting and disclosing the medical history of reproductive tissue donors.\n\nThrough regulations, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must require reproductive tissue banks to collect, verify, and disclose certain information about a donor's medical history. As part of the regulations, HHS must (1) set out the medical information that a donor must disclose to a tissue bank, including familial medical conditions and the contact information of a medical professional who has examined the donor; and (2) require donors to waive privacy and other protections that limit disclosure of personal health information.\n\nA tissue bank must provide, at no cost, the donor's medical information to the recipient of the donor tissue, the recipient's physician, or a person conceived using the donor tissue (if that person is either 18 years of age or older or has the consent of a parent or guardian)."
