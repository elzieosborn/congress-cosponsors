New farmers and small or mid-sized family farms qualify as eligible small businesses under this FNS program, as well as packers, distributors, cooperatives, and others that source agricultural products from them.\n\nThe bill also requires a state's TEFAP plan eligibility standards to include, at a minimum, all individuals or households with an income less than 250% of the poverty line."
