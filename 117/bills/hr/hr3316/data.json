The individual must continue employment with the new employer for at least four weeks before July 4, 2021, to be eligible for the first $1,212 payment under the bill and for at least eight weeks before July 4, 2021, to be eligible for the final $1,212 payment.\n\nThe bill otherwise eliminates federal reimbursement for Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation payments."
