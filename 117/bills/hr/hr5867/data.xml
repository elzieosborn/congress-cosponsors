This bill repeals the Military Selective Service Act, which requires most men of ages 18 through 25 years old to register with the Selective Service System in case a draft is reinstated.

 The assets, contracts, property, unexpended balances, and records held by the Selective Service System must be transferred to the General Services Administration upon the repeal.

The Office of Personnel Management must assist officers and employees of the Selective Service System to transfer to other positions in the executive branch.</summary>
