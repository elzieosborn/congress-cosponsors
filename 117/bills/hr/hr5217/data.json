    "text": "Federal Acquisition E-Commerce Fairness and Competition Act\n\nThis bill requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to expand the testing program for e-commerce portal models.\n\nSpecifically, the GSA must (1) expand the proof-of-concept testing program by testing at least three commercial e-commerce portal models, including the E-Commerce Model, the E-Procurement Model, and the E-Marketplace Model (as described in a GSA implementation plan published in March 2018), to ensure that such program is representative of available commercial e-commerce portal models that qualify for the program; and (2) report to Congress.\n\nThe GSA must ensure that a commercial e-commerce portal provider awarded a contract that is owned or controlled by a person or entity with a market capitalization greater than $600 billion at any time in the two years preceding this bill's enactment (e.g., Amazon) does not sell products through the commercial e-commerce portal that compete with products sold by any third-party supplier through such portal."
