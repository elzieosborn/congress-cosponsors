This bill requires that land use revenues received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in connection with the use of certain leases or third-party land use at the VA's West Los Angeles Campus in Los Angeles, California, be used exclusively for specified purposes on campus.

The bill prescribes that such revenues be used exclusively for

 the renovation and maintenance of the land and facilities at the campus; supporting construction, maintenance, and services at the campus relating to temporary or permanent supportive housing for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families; implementing minor construction projects at the campus; or implementing community operations at the campus that support the development of emergency shelter or supportive housing for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. The bill also increases the maximum time period for enhanced-use leases at the campus from 75 to 99 years.

Additionally, the bill requires the VA to include in its annual report evaluating leases and land-sharing agreements on campus an assessment of (1) the manner in which revenue generated by the leases is expended, and (2) the direct benefits the expenditures provide to veterans.</summary>
