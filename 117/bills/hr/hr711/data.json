The bill also increases the maximum time period for enhanced-use leases at the campus from 75 to 99 years.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires the VA to include in its annual report evaluating leases and land-sharing agreements on campus an assessment of (1) the manner in which revenue generated by the leases is expended, and (2) the direct benefits the expenditures provide to veterans."
