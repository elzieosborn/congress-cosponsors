Among other topics, the agenda must address (1) the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, (2) how cannabis effects specified populations, and (3) other public safety considerations. Additionally, the NIH must designate centers of excellence in cannabis research at institutions of higher education to conduct interdisciplinary research about biomedical, behavioral, and social issues related to cannabis. The CDC must work with other agencies to collect population-wide data about cannabis use, including (1) demographic factors, (2) health outcomes, (3) product variety, and (4) other relevant health information."
