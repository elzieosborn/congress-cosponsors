  <summary date="2021-12-03T11:26:35Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits the use of federal funds for temporary or permanent fencing around the perimeter of any U.S. Capitol buildings or grounds. It also requires the existing temporary fencing to be removed within 15 days of the bill's enactment.

On January 7, 2021, in response to the previous day's events, razor wire fencing was erected to secure the perimeter of the U.S. Capitol; the fencing was initially to remain in place for 30 days and has since been kept in place through periodic extensions.</summary>
