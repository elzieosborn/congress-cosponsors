The bill also authorizes the FDA to expedite review of such a device to mitigate or prevent a shortage.\n\nThe bill also requires the manufacturer of an essential medical device or drug to report annually to the FDA certain information, such as details about all locations of production and the sourcing of component parts or active pharmaceutical ingredients."
