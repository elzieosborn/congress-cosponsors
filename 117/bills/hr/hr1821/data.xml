This bill modifies requirements governing the use of pesticides in or near navigable waters. Specifically, the bill prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency or states from requiring permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System for discharges of pesticides into navigable waters if the pesticides are (1) registered, (2) used for their intended purposes, and (3) used in compliance with their pesticide label requirements. The bill establishes exemptions from this prohibition.</summary>
