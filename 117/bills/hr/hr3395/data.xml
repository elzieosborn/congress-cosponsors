This bill reinstates and extends through 2028 the tax credit for nonbusiness energy property. It increases the rate of such credit from 10% to 15% and raises the lifetime cap on such credit from $500 to $1,200.

The bill increases credit amounts for the investment in energy efficient building property (e.g., electric heat pump water heater, electric heat pump, central air conditioner, or natural gas, propane, or oil water heater) and provides for increased caps on investment in doors and windows in a residence.</summary>
