This bill generally prohibits employers from relying on the wage history of prospective employees when considering them for employment or determining their wages.

However, an employer may rely on wage history voluntarily offered by a prospective employee to support a higher wage than was initially offered. An employer also may seek to confirm voluntarily supplied wage history with a prospective employee's current or former employer.

An employer may not retaliate against an employee or prospective employee who opposes a practice made unlawful by this bill.

The bill provides for enforcement of these prohibitions through civil penalties and other remedies.</summary>
