This bill terminates certain benefits for Members of Congress or former Members.

Specifically, the bill prohibits payments of death gratuities to survivors of Members of Congress. It also terminates coverage under (1) the Federal Employees Retirement System for Members, and (2) the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program for former Members. Such provisions take effect beginning in the 118th Congress.

Additionally, the bill eliminates certain benefits and services for former Members of the House of Representatives (e.g., access to the House chamber, parking spaces, or the Members' Dining Room) unless the benefits or services are made available to the public.</summary>
