This bill reauthorizes through FY2027 and expands the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. Under this program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) makes grants to eligible nonprofit organizations (tax-exempt organizations and those determined to be at risk of a terrorist attack) for target hardening and other security enhancements to protect against terrorist attacks.

In particular, the bill makes elementary, secondary, private, and religious schools eligible for grants under the program.</summary>
