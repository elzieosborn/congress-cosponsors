Such a communication must be (1) neither false nor misleading when measured objectively against the available information at the time; (2) accompanied by certain disclaimers, if required, including a statement identifying any differences between the communicated information and the vaccine's authorized labeling; and (3) based on competent and reliable scientific evidence."
