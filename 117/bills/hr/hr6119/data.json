Specifically, the act provides appropriations to\n\n the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of State. The act also extends several expiring authorities, including\n\n the authority for the Department of Health and Human Services to make certain appointments for the National Disaster Medical System, the special assessment under the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 on nonindigent people or entities convicted of certain criminal offenses (e.g., sexual abuse and trafficking), the temporary scheduling order issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration to place fentanyl-related substances in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the current Medicaid federal matching rate (also known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP) for certain territories, and the pay freeze for certain senior officials and political appointees in the executive branch."
