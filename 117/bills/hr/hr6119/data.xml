  <summary date="2023-08-02T16:46:30Z" status="Public Law">Further Extending Government Funding Act 

This act provides continuing FY2022 appropriations for federal agencies, provides supplemental appropriations, and extends several expiring authorities.

Specifically, the act provides continuing FY2022 appropriations to federal agencies through the earlier of February 18, 2022, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act.

It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2022 appropriations bills have not been enacted when the existing CR expires on December 3, 2021.

The CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2021 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.

In addition, the act provides supplemental appropriations to several federal agencies for activities related to the evacuees from Afghanistan. Specifically, the act provides appropriations to

 the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of State. The act also extends several expiring authorities, including

 the authority for the Department of Health and Human Services to make certain appointments for the National Disaster Medical System, the special assessment under the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 on nonindigent people or entities convicted of certain criminal offenses (e.g., sexual abuse and trafficking), the temporary scheduling order issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration to place fentanyl-related substances in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the current Medicaid federal matching rate (also known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP) for certain territories, and the pay freeze for certain senior officials and political appointees in the executive branch.</summary>
