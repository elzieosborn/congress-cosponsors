    "text": "Tribal Access to Clean Water Act of 2022\n\nThis bill provides funding for and expands access to water resources for Native communities (i.e., Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian communities).\n\nFirst, the bill provides funding for the Indian Health Service to (1) provide essential sanitation facilities to community structures (e.g., schools, hospitals, and tribal offices) that were not previously considered eligible for such service; (2) provide technical assistance; and (3) operate and maintain water facilities that serve Native communities.\n\n Next, the bill provides funding for the Department of Agriculture to provide water and wastewater facility grants to eligible entities (e.g., Native communities) that have residents facing significant health risks due to inadequate water supply systems. The bill specifies that these funds shall not require any matching contribution.\n\nIn addition, the bill reauthorizes through FY2032 the Bureau of Reclamation's Rural Water Supply Program. Further, the bill provides funding for and establishes a grant program for tribal clean water access projects. It also provides funding for the Native American Affairs Technical Assistance Program."
