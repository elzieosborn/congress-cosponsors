  <summary date="2021-12-14T14:45:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Made in America Emergency Preparedness Act

This bill establishes in the legislative branch the National Commission on United States Preparedness for National Emergencies and requires any medical, pharmaceutical, or emergency preparedness product deemed integral to a response to a national emergency to be manufactured and procured in the United States beginning on and after January 1, 2026.

The commission must, among other things, examine and report on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020 and the private sector response, investigate the origin of the COVID-19 virus and measures for mitigating the impacts of future physical and medical national disasters, determine what medical, pharmaceutical, and emergency preparedness products are deemed to be essential to emergency preparedness, and report on infrastructure or capability deficiencies in hospitals and medical centers.

States must implement the commission's findings or lose access to federal emergency preparedness funds.

The bill allows 100% tax expensing for qualified pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing property (e.g., personal protective equipment) placed in service after 2020 and before 2027.</summary>
