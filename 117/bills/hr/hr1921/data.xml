  <summary date="2021-07-28T19:09:11Z" status="Passed House">This bill reauthorizes through FY2026 and revises the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program.

Under the existing program, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must develop and fund projects to restore the ecological health of the basin, which is located in Louisiana and Mississippi. The bill requires the EPA to review and revise the basin's comprehensive conservation and management plan at least once every five years. In addition, the bill eliminates a statement of the basin's size.</summary>
