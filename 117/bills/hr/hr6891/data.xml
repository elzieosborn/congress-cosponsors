  <summary date="2022-05-16T18:14:17Z" status="Passed House">Isolate Russian Government Officials Act of 2022

This bill requires the Department of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to take all necessary steps to exclude Russian government officials, to the maximum extent practicable, from certain international meetings, including the activities of the Group of 20, the Basel Committee for Banking Standards, and the Bank for International Settlements.

This requirement shall be in effect until the earlier of five years after the bill's enactment or 30 days after the President reports to Congress that Russia's government has ceased activities to destabilize Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The President may also waive this requirement upon reporting to Congress that doing so is in the national interest of the United States.</summary>
