Additionally, the act directs the DEA to register manufacturers and distributors of CBD or marijuana for the purpose of commercial production of an approved drug that contains marijuana or its derivative.\n\nFinally, the act includes various other provisions, including provisions that\n\n require the DEA to assess whether there is an adequate and uninterrupted supply of marijuana for research purposes; prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from reinstating the interdisciplinary review process for marijuana research; allow physicians to discuss the potential harms and benefits of marijuana and its derivatives (including CBD) with patients; and require HHS, in coordination with the National Institutes of Health and relevant federal agencies, to report on the therapeutic potential of marijuana for various conditions such as epilepsy, as well as the impact on adolescent brains and on the ability to operate a motor vehicle."
