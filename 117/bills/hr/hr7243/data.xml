This bill prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from charging any entitlement to retraining assistance under the Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance Program in situations where an individual was unable to complete a course or program as a result of the closure of an educational institution or the disapproval of a program by the state approving agency or the VA. The period for which retraining assistance is not charged must be equal to the full amount of retraining assistance provided for enrollment in the program of education.

In the event of a closure or disapproval, the educational institution must not receive any further payments under the program.</summary>
