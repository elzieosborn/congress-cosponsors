This bill makes various changes to the processes used by the National Library of Medicine to select scientific journals for inclusion in its databases.

The changes include requiring the use of an objective rubric to evaluate journals for inclusion and providing the right to appeal a delisting. In addition, the library must make publicly available the metrics used to determine whether to list or delist journals.</summary>
