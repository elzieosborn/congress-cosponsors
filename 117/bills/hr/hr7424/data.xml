  <summary date="2023-08-17T14:00:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Solitary Confinement Reform Act of 2022

This bill limits the use of restrictive housing (such as solitary confinement) in certain prison facilities. These facilities are those under the jurisdiction of (1) the Bureau of Prisons, (2) the Department of Defense, or (3) a state or local government in which persons are held in custody pursuant to a contract or agreement with the federal government and the facility receives federal funds for law enforcement purposes.

For example, the bill specifies that inmates shall be housed in the least restrictive setting necessary for safety purposes. It also requires that inmates remain in restrictive housing for no longer than necessary to address each specific reason for such placement.</summary>
