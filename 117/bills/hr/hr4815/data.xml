  <summary date="2021-12-07T12:37:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Higher Education Dream Act of 2021

This bill prohibits institutions of higher education that receive federal student aid from discriminating against Dreamer students (e.g., students who have been granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status) based on their immigration status, including charging out-of-state tuition to students who would qualify as residents of the state. The bill also makes Dreamer students&#160;eligible for federal financial aid.

The bill&#160;prohibits the use or publication of certain identifiable information related to such students, subject to civil penalties.</summary>
