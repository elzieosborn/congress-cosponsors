This bill restricts the sale, lease, or use of recalled motor vehicles by federal agencies.

Specifically, if an agency has received notification that a motor vehicle or related equipment owned by the agency contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard, the agency may not sell or lease the vehicle unless specified steps are taken to remedy the defect or noncompliance or must notify the purchaser or individual leasing the vehicle.

The agency must make all reasonable efforts to prevent the use of such vehicle, subject to certain exceptions, until the defect or noncompliance has been remedied.</summary>
