A money market fund that elects to do so shall not be subject to specified\u00a0requirements related to the imposition of liquidity fees. (A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in liquid, short-term assets.)\n\nCurrent law limits the provision of certain\u00a0federal assistance directly to any money market fund. The bill requires disclosure of this limitation on federal assistance in a money market's\u00a0advertising\u00a0and sales literature."
