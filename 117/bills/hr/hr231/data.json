A covered individual is defined to include the President, the Vice President, the head of any executive department, and any individual occupying a position designated by the President as a cabinet-level position. No federal agency may enter into a contract with a business owned or controlled by a covered individual or family member.\n\nA business shall be deemed to be owned or controlled by a covered individual or family member if any such person (1) is a member of the board of directors or similar governing body of the business, (2) directly or indirectly owns or controls more than 50% of the voting shares of the business, or (3) is the beneficiary of a trust which owns or controls more than 50% of the business and can direct distributions under the terms of the trust."
