(Currently, for purposes of Medicare coverage, radiology imaging facilities that furnish such LDCT screenings must report certain data to approved registries.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides funds for FY2022-FY2026 for grants to help entities establish free registries, and requires registries to be interoperable in order to receive federal funds. The bill also provides grants to support the development of related quality measures for lung cancer screenings."
