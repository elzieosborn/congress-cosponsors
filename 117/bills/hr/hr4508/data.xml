This bill requires the Bureau of Justice Assistance to pay compensation to direct victims of civil rights era violence.

An individual is a direct victim and may receive payment if the individual (1) is a U.S. citizen, (2) sustained an injury as a result of racial violence during the civil rights era, (3) can provide evidence of the injury sustained through medical records, and (4) is incurring expenses related to that injury.

The benefit amount is the cost of the individual's medical care associated with the injury, as demonstrated by the direct victim's medical records.

A family member of a direct victim shall be eligible for a benefit if he or she is responsible for the costs related to the injury and the direct victim is deceased.</summary>
