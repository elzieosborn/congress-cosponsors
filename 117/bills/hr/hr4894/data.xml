This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish the genuine progress indicator as a metric to measure the economic well-being of households.

The indicator shall be calculated through adjustments to gross domestic product that account for positive and negative economic, environmental, and social factors that contribute to economic activity. It shall also include the total annual economic value and cost of such factors.

The head of each federal agency, the President, the Federal Reserve, and Congress must use both the indicator and gross domestic product for budgetary reporting and economic forecasting that measures the net benefits of economic activity.</summary>
