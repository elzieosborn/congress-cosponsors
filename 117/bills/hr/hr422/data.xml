This bill limits donations to inaugural committees and requires these committees to disclose donations and disbursements.

Specifically, inaugural committees may not solicit, accept, or receive donations from corporations or foreign nationals. An individual may not make a donation in the name of another individual or authorize his or her name to be used to make such a donation. In addition, foreign nationals may not make donations or make promises to make donations to inaugural committees.

Further, the bill caps the amount an individual may donate to an inaugural committee.

Donations to inaugural committees may not be converted to personal use.

Finally, inaugural committees must report certain information on donations and disbursements to the Federal Election Commission.</summary>
