  <summary date="2023-02-09T22:10:56Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare for America Act of 2019 [sic]

This bill establishes several health insurance programs and otherwise modifies certain requirements relating to health care coverage, costs, and services.

In particular, the bill establishes a national health insurance program to be&#160;administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among other requirements, the program must (1) cover all U.S. residents; (2) cover specified items and services, including hospital services, prescription drugs, dental services, and home- and community-based long-term care; and (3) be fully implemented in 2026. HHS must also offer a transitional public health option that provides certain minimum coverage through health insurance exchanges in 2024 and 2025.

The bill also makes a series of other changes to health care and tax provisions. For example, the bill (1) allows federal funds to be used for abortions; (2) sunsets a specified tax reform law that, among other things, repealed the penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential health coverage; and (3) prohibits excessive prices for prescription drugs and medical devices, as determined by a newly established federal regulatory board.</summary>
