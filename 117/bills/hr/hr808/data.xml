This bill establishes requirements related to the use of financial transactions in human trafficking. The Financial Institutions Examination Council&#160;must review procedures to improve the capability of specified programs to target financial transactions relating to severe forms of human trafficking.

 The Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking must submit to Congress recommendations&#160;for the revision of&#160;anti-money laundering programs specifically targeting severe forms of human trafficking.

The bill provides additional criteria to be considered by the Department of State to indicate a country's serious and sustained efforts to eliminate human trafficking for purposes of certain foreign assistance. Specifically, the bill adds criteria regarding whether a country has taken or is taking steps to implement a framework for preventing financial transactions involving severe forms of human trafficking.</summary>
