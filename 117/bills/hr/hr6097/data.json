The strategy must promote and facilitate (1) cross-investments and export opportunities between tribes and Indigenous peoples in tribal businesses and commercial enterprises that involve Indigenous peoples, and (2) the development of supply chains for U.S. entities that include certified products produced by tribes and Indigenous peoples.\n\nAdditionally, the Inter-American Foundation, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation must (1) consult with representatives of civil society organizations, especially organizations comprised of or representing the interests of Indigenous peoples; and (2) provide assistance to Western Hemisphere countries that promotes and facilitates entrepreneurship among Indigenous peoples."
