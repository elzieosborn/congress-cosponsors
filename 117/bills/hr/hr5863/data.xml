This bill modifies requirements for importing palm oil and makes other changes to address deforestation and other potential harms from cultivating and processing palm oil. For example, the bill (1) specifies that palm oil does not qualify for exclusions from importation requirements granted to common cultivars or common food crops, and (2) prohibits imported palm oil products from being treated as renewable fuel for purposes of the Renewable Fuel Program.</summary>
