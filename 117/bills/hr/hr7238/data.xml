  <summary date="2022-07-12T19:29:21Z" status="Introduced in House">Timely Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder Act of 2022

This bill allows opioid treatment programs to admit individuals who have been addicted to opioids for less than one year for maintenance treatment (the use of medications such as methadone in treating opioid addiction).

Current regulations generally bar an opioid treatment program from admitting individuals for such treatment unless they have been addicted to opioids for more than one year. The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to revise its regulations to allow admission when the duration of an individual's opioid addiction is less than one year.</summary>
