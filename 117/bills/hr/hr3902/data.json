Launch site is defined as the location on Earth from which a launch takes place and necessary facilities at that location, and reentry site is defined as the location on Earth to which a reentry vehicle (i.e., spacecraft) is intended to return.\n\nGrants issued to an operator may not exceed $2.5 million for a fiscal year.\n\nDOT may issue supplemental grants to operators in support of state, local, or private matching under specified conditions."
