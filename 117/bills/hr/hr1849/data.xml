  <summary date="2021-07-19T21:33:35Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry out activities to strengthen core public health infrastructure. Core public health infrastructure includes the elements and workforce capabilities that enable health departments to perform critical functions such as disease surveillance and emergency response.

Specifically, the CDC must award grants to state health departments for their core infrastructure needs. The CDC may also award grants to address core infrastructure needs on a competitive basis to state, tribal, territorial, or local health departments. In addition, the CDC must develop accreditation standards for health departments and public health laboratories.

The CDC must also take steps to expand and improve its own public health infrastructure.</summary>
