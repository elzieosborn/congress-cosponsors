This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award states competitive grants for technology networks that coordinate the provision of health care and social services (e.g., nutritional assistance, housing, and transportation).

States must use the grants to support statewide or regional public-private partnerships in establishing or enhancing such networks. The bill outlines requirements concerning the governance structure of the networks, privacy and security, and related matters.

The Government Accountability Office must evaluate the impact of these networks on health outcomes, access to services, and related factors.</summary>
