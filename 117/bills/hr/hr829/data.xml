This bill allows certain grants authorized under the Violence Against Women Act to be used to support victims of female genital mutilation. Such grants already support victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.

The bill also requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to classify female genital mutilation as a Part II crime (i.e., a less serious offense) in the Uniform Crime Reports. (The FBI compiles and periodically publishes crime statistics through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Currently, the FBI does not compile and publish information about female genital mutilation.)</summary>
