This bill authorizes the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on any foreign person that is responsible for or involved in specified activities that are detrimental to the environment.

Such activities include (1) causing significant excess greenhouse gas emissions associated with power generation; (2) causing significant or illegal deforestation or loss of natural carbon sinks; and (3) knowingly misrepresenting the environmental impact of a project, investment, or product.

The bill further states that it is U.S. policy to consider any act of corruption related to such activities and any violation of internationally recognized human rights committed against specified individuals to be sanctionable.</summary>
