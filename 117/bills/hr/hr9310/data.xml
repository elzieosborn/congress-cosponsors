This bill requires the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to review scientific evidence concerning clinical preventive service recommendations and update those recommendations if supported by those reviews on a more frequent basis.

The task force is an independent panel of national experts in disease prevention and evidence-based medicine that makes recommendations (subject to public comment) about clinical preventive services. Currently, the task force must review relevant evidence about its recommendations, and update them if necessary, at least once during every five-year period.

Under this bill, the task force must implement a process for carrying out ongoing reviews of scientific evidence related to its existing recommendations and new topics and report findings and other information about those reviews on a quarterly basis.

The bill also requires the task force to determine whether to initiate the process for updating or modifying a recommendation before the close of the five-year period if (1) the scientific review supports such early action, or (2) the Food and Drug Administration approves or clears a new screening test or medication that could serve as a preventive strategy or modality related to a recommendation.</summary>
