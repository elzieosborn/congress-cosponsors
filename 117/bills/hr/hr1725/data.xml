This bill provides additional FY2021 funding for the Department of the Treasury's Emergency Rental Assistance program, which was established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program provides grants to states, local governments, and territories for financial assistance to households for rent, utilities, and other housing expenses. Low-income households that are at risk of homelessness and are experiencing unemployment or financial hardship are eligible. The aggregate period of assistance a household may receive under this program may not exceed 18 months.</summary>
