  <summary date="2021-06-21T18:50:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Prioritizing Revised Operations To Eliminate Cyanobacteria Toxins in Florida Act or the&#160;PROTECT Florida Act

This bill&#160;modifies requirements regarding&#160;water infrastructure projects in&#160;central and&#160;southern Florida.

Specifically, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) must include in such projects&#160;specified&#160;public health considerations, including those related to cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and other toxins.

The bill also prohibits the use of restoration funds for deep well injection (a liquid-waste disposal technology).

In addition, the USACE must (1) develop a master operational manual to ensure system management that protects public health and Everglades restoration; and (2) with the National Academies of Sciences, study the legacy of pollution and nutrient loading, as well as the impacts of soil amendments.</summary>
