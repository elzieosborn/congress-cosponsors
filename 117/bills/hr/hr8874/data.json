    "text": "Credit Card Competition Act of 2022 \n\nThis bill addresses network access and competition in electronic credit transactions.\n\nThe bill generally prohibits credit card issuers from restricting the number of payment card networks on which an electronic credit transaction may be processed. Specifically, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must prohibit certain credit card issuers with assets of over $100 billion from restricting the number of networks on which credit card transactions may be processed to\n\n one network, two or more networks operated by affiliated networks or persons, or the two networks with the largest market share of credit cards issued. Additionally, credit card issuers are prohibited from imposing certain limitations on the routing of electronic credit transactions, such as through penalties for failure to meet a specified threshold of transactions on a particular payment card network.\n\nThe board must also provide for the designation of payment card networks that pose a security risk to the United States or are owned, operated, or sponsored by a foreign state entity."
