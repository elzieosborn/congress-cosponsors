Federal Reserve Banks must exchange Federal Reserve notes with gold at this price. If a Federal Reserve Bank does not do this, Treasury must make any exchange and place a corresponding lien on the assets of that bank.\n\nIn addition, Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve must report on U.S. gold holdings."
