    "text": "Bolstering Long-term Understanding and Exploration of the Great Lakes, Oceans, Bays, and Estuaries Act or the BLUE GLOBE Act\n\nThis bill addresses data collection and monitoring of the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts.\n\nThe bill increases domestic and international coordination to enhance data management and monitoring of the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts.\n\nIt adds programs for the application and development of innovative technology to the list of technology programs used to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.\n\nIt also modifies requirements related to the scientific workforce in areas of oceanic and atmospheric research and development to include investigating whether there is a workforce shortage, workforce diversity, actions the federal government can take to increase diversity in the scientific workforce, and actions it can take to shorten the hiring backlog for such workforce.\n\nThe National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must (1) ensure that a goal of its cooperative institutes is to advance or apply emerging technologies, (2) create an ocean innovation prize to catalyze the rapid development and deployment of data collection and monitoring technology, and (3) seek to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the potential for an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Oceans.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes through FY2024 various NOAA hydrographic programs, including nautical mapping and charting.\n\nAdditionally, relevant federal agencies must measure the value and impact of industries related to the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts on the U.S. economy."
