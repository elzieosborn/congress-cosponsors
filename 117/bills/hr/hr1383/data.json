    "text": "Debt Control Through Budget Reconciliation Act of 2021\n\nThis bill establishes long-term debt limits and a new reconciliation process to enforce the limits.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits the estimated amount of debt held by the public from exceeding a specified percentage of the estimated nominal gross domestic product (GDP) for a fiscal year. The bill limits the debt to 101% of GDP for FY2022 and decreases the limit annually until it reaches 50% of GDP for FY2050.\n\nThe bill also establishes a new reconciliation process to enforce the limits. Under this process, the congressional budget resolution could direct congressional committees to report legislation to achieve the long-term debt limits. Congress would then be required to consider the legislation using expedited legislative procedures, which limit debate and amendments."
