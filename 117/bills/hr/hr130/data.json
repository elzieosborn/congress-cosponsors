Safes, trigger locks, and storage facilities must be certified by the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nFinally, an individual who violates the safe storage requirements is subject to penalties\u2014criminal penalties if the violation results in the discharge of a firearm, or civil penalties if the violation does not result in the discharge of a firearm. Additionally, DOJ must seize and safely store the individual's firearms and ammunition."
