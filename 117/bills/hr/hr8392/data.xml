This bill requires the Department of Education to award competitive grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to make physical improvements at elementary and secondary schools.

Grant funds must be used to ensure that each elementary and secondary school served by the LEA (1) hires a school resource officer who carries a firearm, and (2) establishes a single point of entry that includes a locked anteroom with metal detectors and bulletproof windows and where the school resource officer inspects all guests prior to entry into another area of the school.</summary>
