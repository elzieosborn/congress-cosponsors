  <summary date="2021-03-10T15:33:56Z" status="Introduced in House">John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act

This bill establishes requirements regarding congressional redistricting, including that redistricting plans must be developed by an independent redistricting commission.

A state that has been redistricted after an apportionment of Representatives may not be redistricted again until after the next apportionment, unless the state is ordered by a court to conduct a subsequent redistricting in order to comply with the Constitution or enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Each state must establish an independent redistricting commission to develop redistricting plans that meet specified criteria. If such a plan is not enacted into law, a state's highest court may select a plan developed by the state's commission. If the state court does not select a plan, a U.S. district court must develop a plan.

The Election Assistance Commission must make payments to states to carry out redistricting.</summary>
