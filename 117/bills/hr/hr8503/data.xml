This bill requires the Department of State develop and submit to Congress a strategy to promote the use of secure telecommunication infrastructure in countries other than the United States.

 The State Department must also report to Congress on (1) efforts by China and Russia to advance authoritarian interests or oppose fair, industry-led processes at the International Telecommunication Union, the U.N. agency involved with setting telecommunications standards and related regulatory activities; and (2) opportunities for greater collaboration with allies and partners to promote secure information and communications technology infrastructure in countries other than the United States.</summary>
