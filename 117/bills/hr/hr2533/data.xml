This bill directs the Department of Commerce to arrange for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study that

 examines the existing science of ocean acidification in estuarine environments, examines the challenges to studying ocean acidification and acidification's interactions with other environment stressors in estuarine environments, provides recommendations for improving future research with respect to ocean acidification in estuarine environments, and identifies pathways for applying science in management and mitigation decisions related to ocean acidification in those environments.</summary>
