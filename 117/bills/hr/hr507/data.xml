This bill provides for additional annual&#160;allocations,&#160;in 2022 through 2026, of the qualifying advanced energy project tax credit. A qualifying advanced energy project is a project that reequips, expands, or establishes a manufacturing facility for the production of energy from alternative sources, including solar, wind, or other renewable resources.
