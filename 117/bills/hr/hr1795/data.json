    "text": "Expanded Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act\n\nThis bill modifies certain changes that are scheduled to take effect under the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act relating to the coverage of former foster youth under Medicaid.\n\nUnder current law, a state Medicaid program must cover former foster youth until the age of 26 if the youth were in the state's foster care system at the age of 18 and were enrolled in the state's Medicaid program while in foster care; a state may choose to also cover former foster youth from other states. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act altered these provisions to require a state Medicaid program to cover former foster youth from other states until the age of 26; such changes apply to\u00a0former foster youth\u00a0who reach the age of 18 on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nThe bill requires state Medicaid programs to also cover former foster youth who were placed in a legal guardianship with a kinship caregiver or were emancipated from foster care before the age of 18. The bill also repeals the provision that requires former foster youth to have been enrolled in a state Medicaid program while in foster care in order to qualify for Medicaid coverage until the age of 26. States must also establish Medicaid outreach and enrollment programs for former foster youth."
