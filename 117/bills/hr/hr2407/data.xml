  <summary date="2021-09-09T22:29:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Better Way for Providers To Repay Act of 2021

This bill modifies recoupment provisions under the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19. The program provides Medicare payments in advance to eligible providers experiencing claims or cash flow disruptions, such as during national emergencies; the program was specifically expanded in response to COVID-19 to encompass more types of providers, subject to certain recoupment and repayment provisions.

The bill provides for an additional 3 months before recoupment of advance payments (through claims offsets) begins, so that recoupment begins 15 months (rather than 12 months) after payments are made. The bill also applies repayments that providers have already made toward the collection of offsets for a corresponding amount of time.</summary>
