This bill also requires that Members reimburse the Treasury for amounts paid resulting from any unlawful discrimination and related retaliation.\n\nAdditionally, the bill grants congressional employees a 10-day period to amend a filing alleging employment discrimination if the hearing officer determines the initial filing failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted.\n\nThe bill also allows the Office of Employee Advocacy to continue to assist a congressional employee with investigations and proceedings related to a claim of workplace discrimination even after the employee begins federal court proceedings."
