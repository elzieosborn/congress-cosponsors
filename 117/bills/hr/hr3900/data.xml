This bill restricts the performance of an abortion on an unemancipated minor under 18 years of age.

Specifically, it prohibits a person or organization from performing, facilitating, or assisting with an abortion on an unemancipated minor without first complying with certain requirements, including parental notification and a 96-hour waiting period.

 It establishes penalties&#8212;a fine, up to one year in prison, or both&#8212;for each willful violation.

A parent who is required to be notified of an abortion of an unemancipated minor may sue in federal court to prohibit the abortion. Parental notification requirements may be waived in a medical emergency or in a case of physical abuse.</summary>
