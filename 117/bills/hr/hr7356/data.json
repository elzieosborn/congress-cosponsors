    "text": "TPS Reform Act of 2022\n\nThis bill changes the procedures for designating a country with temporary protected status (TPS). (Qualified nationals of a TPS-designated country shall have work authorization and may not be removed from the United States while the status is in effect.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires an act of Congress to designate a TPS country, whereas currently the Department of Homeland Security has such authority. The initial act of designating a TPS country must include a time period for the designation of up to 18 months and also contain certain information, including an estimate of the number of individuals who would benefit from the status. Congress may also pass an act to terminate or extend a designation.\n\nThe bill also establishes that an alien who lacks lawful immigration status may not receive the benefits of temporary protected status."
