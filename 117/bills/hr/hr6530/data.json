It also addresses matters related to the senior caregiver workforce.\n\nTo receive a grant, an assisted living facility must demonstrate that it had uncompensated losses due to COVID-19 and consistently maintained operations from March 13, 2020, to December 31, 2020. A facility must also certify that the grant is necessary for its ongoing operations.\n\nHHS must also award grants to assisted living facilities for broadband connectivity and telehealth support and other operation and maintenance costs.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the efficacy of these grants.\n\nWith respect to the senior caregiver workforce, the bill authorizes grants for assisted living facilities to establish or expand workforce training and recruitment programs. The National Health Care Workforce Commission must also designate the workforce needs of assisted living and other senior care populations as a high priority area and report on those needs."
