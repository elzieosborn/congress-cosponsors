This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to enter into an agreement with an independent, nonpartisan, science-based research organization to carry out a study on the time lunches are served, the time that recess is offered, and the duration of lunch periods at schools participating in the National School Lunch Program.

USDA must also

 make the findings of the study publicly available online; establish a task force, in coordination with the Department of Education, to review the study, review other related research, and develop best practices for lunch and recess periods to ensure student health, including appropriate nutritional intake; and issue guidance regarding such best practices to schools participating in the National School Lunch Program.</summary>
