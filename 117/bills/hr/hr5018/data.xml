  <summary date="2022-09-15T15:51:46Z" status="Introduced in House">Fiscal Analysis by Income and Race Scoring Act or the FAIR Scoring Act

This bill requires the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) cost estimates for legislation to include a distributional analysis by race and income if the legislation will have a gross budgetary effect of at least 0.1% of gross domestic product in any fiscal year during the 10-year budget window.

CBO's analysis must show the transfers that would result by race and income level, and the effects must be shown both in dollars and as a percent change in after-tax-and-transfer-income.

The bill also requires CBO to report to Congress on methods for conducting such a distributional analysis by gender.</summary>
