This bill revises the Community Reinvestment Act, which addresses the availability of credit in communities. Under the act, financial regulators examine a banking institution's community activities such as lending, investments, and services, particularly for low- and moderate-income populations.

Specifically, the bill sets forth examination requirements regarding an institution's

 illegal or discriminatory activity, partnerships with non-depository lenders, home mortgage lending targeted to low- and moderate-income borrowers, and community service or charity work. Each institution must establish Community Advisory Committees in areas served by the institution.</summary>
