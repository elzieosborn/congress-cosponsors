This bill requires the U.S. Maritime Administration to provide grants to eligible applicants for the procurement of container cranes with a lifting capacity in excess of 50 tons for use at ports located in the United States.

The funds may be used to procure such a crane, including to pay for any manufacturing costs associated with the procurement, provided that the entity manufacturing the crane is not associated with a country that is a nonmarket economy, fails to protect intellectual property rights, and violates foreign trade agreements. For cranes in use before this bill's enactment, funds may also be used to replace any software from such a country.</summary>
