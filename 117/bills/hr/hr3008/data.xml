This bill modifies requirements for appraisers of Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages. Currently, an appraiser must be certified by certain state or national entities. The bill removes the national entities&#160;from the list of approved certification entities and allows an appraiser for a mortgage for single-family housing to be state-licensed rather than state-certified to meet requirements. The bill also provides specified educational requirements for appraisers for mortgages for single-family housing.</summary>
