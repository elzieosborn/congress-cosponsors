This bill expands the list of actions that may result in the change of control of an institution of higher education (IHE) to include a court-ordered receivership.

Such changes of control disqualify an IHE from participating in federal student-aid programs unless the IHE establishes that it meets specific requirements following the change of control.</summary>
