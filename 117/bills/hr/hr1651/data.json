Currently, these provisions expire March 27, 2021. The bill extends these provisions for one year.\n\nThe bill also allows for modification of a Chapter 13 repayment plan for plans confirmed before the date of enactment of this bill if the debtor is experiencing material financial hardship due to COVID-19. Currently, such a modification is only available for plans confirmed before March 27, 2020."
