(Generally, foreign states are immune from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, including state courts, except in certain situations, such as when the foreign state has waived immunity.)\n\nThe bill also makes inadmissible into the United States a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) who has engaged in certain serious and extraterritorial counter-dissident activities on behalf of a foreign government, including actions to harass or harm journalists or activists."
