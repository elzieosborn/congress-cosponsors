This bill amends provisions related to the detention of non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law).

For example, the bill (1) increases to $3,000 (currently $1,500) the minimum amount of a security bond that the Department of Homeland Security may require before releasing a detained non-U.S. national from custody while a decision is pending as to whether to remove that non-U.S. national from the United States, (2) allows for the detention of a non-U.S. national who is a suspected terrorist for up to 30 days (currently 7 days) before that individual must be placed in removal proceedings or charged with a crime, and (3) increases the length of time such an individual may be detained.</summary>
