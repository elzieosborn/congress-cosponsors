    "text": "Student Loan Relief Act\n\nThis bill establishes a program to discharge certain federal student loan debt.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to automatically discharge (i.e., repay or cancel) up to $50,000 of outstanding student loan debt for each borrower. Members of Congress are not eligible to receive loan discharges.\n\nFurther, the bill outlines the method of loan discharge and excludes the loan discharges from taxable income.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires ED to automatically place each federal student loan borrower in administrative forbearance for the one-year period in which ED carries out the discharge of student loans. During this period, payments are not due, interest does not accrue, and ED may not pursue debt collection activities (e.g., wage garnishments)."
