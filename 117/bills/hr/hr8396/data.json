    "text": "Loving v. Virginia Codification Act of 2022\n\nThis bill provides statutory authority for interracial marriages.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits any state from enacting a law or regulation that infringes on the right to marry or not marry a person of another race. (The Supreme Court held that state laws barring interracial marriages were unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia in 1967.)\n\nThe bill allows the Department of Justice to bring a civil action for violations. It also establishes a private right of action through Section 1983 lawsuits (Section 1983 is a federal statute that allows individuals to sue state or local government actors for violations of constitutional rights)."
