Such a categorical exclusion shall not be subject to judicial review.\n\nThe bill also categorically excludes certain forest management activities from requirements for environmental assessments or environmental impact statements. The forest management activities designated for such a categorical exclusion are those\n\n carried out by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Department of the Interior jointly with another federal agency on certain National Forest System lands or certain public lands, respectively; and for which a categorical exclusion applies with respect to such other agency. USDA or Interior, as appropriate, may use the categorical exclusion after first obtaining written confirmation from the other federal agency that the categorical exclusion applies to the proposed forest management activity."
