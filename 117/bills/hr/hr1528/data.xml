This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to study and report on possible revisions to limit the ability of issuers of securities and issuer insiders to adopt Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. These plans allow certain employees of publicly traded corporations to sell their shares without violating insider trading prohibitions. The SEC must revise regulations consistent with the results of the study.</summary>
