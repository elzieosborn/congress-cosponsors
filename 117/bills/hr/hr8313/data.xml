This bill expands eligibility for and makes other changes to a supportive housing program for veterans.

Under current law, the program provides housing vouchers to homeless veterans with chronic mental illnesses or substance use disorders and requires veterans to be assigned case managers. This bill (1) permits veterans who are formerly homeless or at risk of becoming homeless to also receive the vouchers, and (2) requires the assignment of a case manager only if the veteran is determined to need case management.</summary>
