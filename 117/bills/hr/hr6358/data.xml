This bill requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to establish agreements with each state to share certain information on a monthly basis about the guardianship arrangements of individuals who are entitled to Social Security benefits or Supplemental Security Income (a federal assistance program that provides monthly cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited income and resources).

The SSA must also periodically report to Congress about Social Security payments that are diverted to nonfamilial representative payees (i.e., individuals appointed by the SSA to manage payments on behalf of recipients).</summary>
