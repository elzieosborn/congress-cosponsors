  <summary date="2021-04-08T22:19:37Z" status="Introduced in House">COVID-19 Emergency Telehealth Impact Reporting Act of 2021

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to analyze the impact of expanded Medicare telehealth services that were authorized through emergency waivers related to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

In developing this analysis, HHS must seek input from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, and other stakeholders.

Additionally, the final report of the analysis must include conclusions about the impact of telehealth on health care delivery and estimates for Medicare spending on telehealth during the COVID-19 emergency.</summary>
