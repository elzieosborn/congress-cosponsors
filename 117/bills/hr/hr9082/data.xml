This bill allows employers to submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) evidence that a competency-based skills test or other employment selection process is consistent with lawful employment practices.

The EEOC must review each submission and determine whether the procedure is job-related and consistent with a business necessity, or provide technical assistance to the employer about potential changes that would allow the EEOC to make such a determination.

Such a determination may be used by the employer to satisfy the burden of proof under the disparate impact analysis with respect to a claim of an unlawful discrimination.</summary>
