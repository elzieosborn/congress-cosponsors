(Peng is a Chinese tennis star who raised allegations of sexual coercion against a retired senior Chinese leader.)\n\nThe sanctions shall not apply to acts related to U.S. intelligence activities. The President may waive application of the sanctions if (1) doing so would be in U.S. national security interests, or (2) Peng has been released and may travel freely and her well-being has been independently confirmed by the U.S. government."
