  <summary date="2023-09-08T18:42:44Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands eligibility for the Bureau of Reclamation's competitive grant program for small water storage and groundwater storage projects. Under the bill, eligible projects must have a capacity of not less than 200 acre-feet (AF) of water. Current law requires an eligible project to have a capacity of not less than 2,000 AF of water.

The bill also allows Reclamation to provide additional grants to certain dam rehabilitation and reconstruction projects provided that projects previously eligible under the program have received the necessary funding.</summary>
