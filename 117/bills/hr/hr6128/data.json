It directs the USTR to impose duties on merchandise from China in an amount equivalent to the annual loss of revenue to U.S. intellectual property rights holders reduced by the amount of tariffs collected for such violations.\n\nDuties collected must be used to compensate U.S. intellectual property rights holders injured by such violations."
