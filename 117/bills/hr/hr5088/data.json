    "text": "Stopping Terrorist Minerals Trade Act\n\nThis bill requires the President to prohibit the importation into or transit through the United States of any mineral or mineral product from Afghanistan.\n\nThe President may waive this requirement for up to one year after certifying that (1) a mineral was mined (or a mineral product was produced) prior to August 16, 2021; (2) the waiver is in U.S. national interests; or (3) a fair, free, and democratic government has control of Afghanistan and is not funding, supporting, or engaging in global terrorism.\n\nThe President must develop and maintain a list of countries engaged in the trade of minerals with Afghanistan and require the heads of federal departments and agencies to review the standards, practices, and procedures of U.S. persons seeking to import any mineral or mineral product of a country on this list. Such U.S. person must keep a full record of complete information relating to the mineral or mineral product sought to be imported.\n\nThe bill provides for enforcement through fines and through customs laws relating to seizure and forfeiture.\n\nThe President must also establish an Oversight Coordinating Committee to coordinate implementation of the bill's requirements.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the effectiveness of these requirements in preventing the importation of minerals or mineral products from Afghanistan."
