The bill defines starter 401(k) deferral-only arrangement as any cash or deferred arrangement that meets specified automatic deferral requirements, contribution limitations, and notice requirements. Such arrangements also allow catch-up contributions for individuals age 50 and over and exempt such employers from complying with certain participation and discrimination standards."
