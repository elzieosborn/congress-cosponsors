(Current law allows such rewards to consist of money, nonmonetary items, or both.)\n\n The State Department must also report to Congress on any cryptocurrency payments made under the rewards program, including an explanation of why a reward was made using cryptocurrency.\n\nThe bill also requires the State Department to report to Congress on the most effective avenues to provide aid to Ukraine, including possible uses of cryptocurrencies or other blockchain-related technologies. (Blockchain is a digital ledger technology that allows for transactions without a trusted intermediary, such as a bank.)\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must report to Congress an assessment of how digital currencies can affect the effectiveness and enforcement of U.S. sanctions relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine."
