Furthermore, the school personnel must\u00a0report all available information regarding the injury to a concussion management team that will confirm and report\u00a0details of the injury\u00a0to the student's parents.\n\nThe school's concussion management team shall consult with and make recommendations to relevant school personnel and the student to ensure that the student is receiving the appropriate academic supports."
