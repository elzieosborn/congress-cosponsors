This bill rescinds funding that was provided to the Department of Transportation for certain unused earmarks.

Under the bill, the term earmark generally refers to congressionally directed spending that would benefit a specific entity or state, locality, or congressional district other than through a statutory or administrative formula or competitive award process.

The bill also requires (1) the rescinded funds to be deposited into the Treasury for the purpose of deficit reduction, and (2) federal agencies to submit certain reports regarding unobligated funds that were provided for earmarks.</summary>
