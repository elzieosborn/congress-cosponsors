This bill increases authorization levels for FY2019-FY2020 for national priority safety programs of the Department of Transportation (DOT).

Additionally, the bill decreases the allocation of funds under such programs for (1) occupant protection, (2) state traffic safety information system improvements, and (3) impaired driving countermeasures.

DOT must award grants to states that enact a commuter safety education program for educational and training programs concerning law enforcement practices during traffic stops and other in-person encounters.

In each fiscal year, 2% of the funds provided for commuter safety education shall be allocated among states that implement commuter safety education programs.</summary>
