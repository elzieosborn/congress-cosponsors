This bill reauthorizes through FY2027 funding for service coordinator programs, which embed staff in certain federally assisted housing to arrange for transportation, case management, and other supportive services for eligible residents.

The bill also makes service coordinators eligible to have qualifying student loans discharged through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must study best practices and other matters concerning service coordinator programs in federally assisted housing in rural areas.</summary>
