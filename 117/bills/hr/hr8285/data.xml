This bill authorizes through FY2027 the Department of Energy (DOE) to research, develop, and commercialize innovative vehicle technologies.

Among other things, the bill requires DOE to

 conduct a program on materials, technologies, and processes with the potential to substantially reduce or eliminate petroleum use and the emissions of&#160; U.S. passenger and commercial vehicles, including in the areas of natural gas and hydrogen vehicle technologies, electrification of vehicle systems, and hydraulic hybrid technologies; implement a program of advanced vehicle manufacturing technologies and practices, including innovative processes to increase the production rate and decrease the cost of advanced battery and fuel cell manufacturing; and seek opportunities to leverage resources and support initiatives of state and local governments in developing and promoting advanced vehicle technologies, manufacturing, and infrastructure.</summary>
