This bill prohibits the revocation of the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization except by a joint resolution of Congress. Currently, the Department of State may revoke such a designation.

Such a designation carries various legal effects. For example, it is unlawful to knowingly provide material support to such an organization. Furthermore, a member of such an organization is barred from entering the United States if the member is a non-U.S. national (an alien under federal law).</summary>
