Currently, the Department of State may revoke such a designation.\n\nSuch a designation carries various legal effects. For example, it is unlawful to knowingly provide material support to such an organization. Furthermore, a member of such an organization is barred from entering the United States if the member is a non-U.S. national (an alien under federal law)."
