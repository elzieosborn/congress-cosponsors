  <summary date="2021-05-19T11:21:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Boosting Revenue Assistance for Venue Operators Act or the BRAVO Act

 This bill modifies a grant program established to provide economic relief to venue operators in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

 Currently, these grants may be awarded to specified live venue operators or promoters, theatrical producers, or live venue operators or promoters, as well as museum operators, motion picture theatre operators, or talent representatives if they do not also receive a paycheck protection loan or an economic injury disaster loan.

 The bill provides that a recipient of a paycheck protection loan or an economic injury disaster loan may still receive a grant under this program, but only if the grant is used for purposes other than those for which the recipient uses the loan funds (e.g., paying payroll costs).</summary>
