As a condition of receiving grant-funded training, a trainee must continue working for the grantee for at least five years.\n\nThe bill also expands the allowable uses of funding to include a trainee's childcare or transportation expenses.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the impact of the grants on health care workforce retention at rural health care facilities."
