Further, the State Department must ensure that at least 25% of COVID-19 vaccine doses intended for international distribution are reserved for and distributed to Taiwan and Latin American allies, and it may not distribute any doses internationally to any recipient or country until Taiwan and Latin American allies receive their first shipment of such doses."
