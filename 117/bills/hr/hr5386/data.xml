This bill makes changes to congressional findings for provisions that provide protection under federal and state laws for members of a professional review body and their staff who take certain reasonable actions that adversely affect the clinical privileges or professional society membership of a physician.

Specifically, the bill recognizes the need for balance between incentives for effective professional review to improve health care quality and protections for competent physicians who face adverse peer review decisions based on factors other than competence or conduct.</summary>
