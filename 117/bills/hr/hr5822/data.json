The delivery area for services and benefits shall be determined in coordination and consultation with the Department of the Interior.\n\nNext, the bill sets forth requirements for the tribe regarding its membership roll, governing documents, and governing body.\n\nUpon request of the tribe, Interior (1) must take into trust certain land in Dorchester and Colleton counties in South Carolina for the benefit of the tribe, and (2) may take into trust land in specified counties for the benefit of the tribe. Land taken into trust shall be considered part of the tribe's reservation.\n\nFurther, the bill prohibits the tribe from conducting gaming activities."
