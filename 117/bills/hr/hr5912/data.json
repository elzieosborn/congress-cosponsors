Industrial loan companies are state chartered institutions that provide several services similar to banks, such as originating loans and processing payments.\n\nParent companies of such industrial loan companies are subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe bill also sets forth procedures regarding a change in control of an industrial loan company.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the effects of industrial loan companies, industrial banks, and other similar institutions on the economy, including the effect on competitiveness, market structure, and different industries."
