Further, the President is encouraged to enter into executive arrangements with foreign governments that support U.S. cyberspace policy.\n\nIn addition, annual country reports on human rights practices must include assessments of freedom of expression in each country with respect to electronic information, and the Government Accountability Office must report on U.S. diplomatic processes and other efforts with foreign countries to advance U.S. interests in cyberspace."
