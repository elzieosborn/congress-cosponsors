  <summary date="2021-09-23T14:37:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Educational Partnerships for Innovation in Communities Program Authorization Act

This bill requires the Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to award a competitive grant to a nonprofit organization to train and support institutions of higher education (IHEs) in assisting local governments by leveraging existing graduate and undergraduate classes for projects of need. Project of need refers to a project that (1) is identified by a local government that would benefit from the expertise of an IHE's faculty and students, and (2) advances a sustainable development goal (e.g., a goal related to climate change and housing affordability).</summary>
