    "text": "Transforming Student Debt to Home Equity Act of 2022\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u00a0to jointly establish and implement a pilot demonstration program to provide, to eligible applicants with federal student loan debt, assistance in purchasing eligible properties. Specifically, the program may provide for (1) discounts on the appraised value of eligible properties, (2) flexibility in certain underwriting standards, (3) the development of new mortgage products specifically targeted to eligible applicants, and (4) other appropriate assistance. The program must provide for the development of a program that uses actuarial information to determine how the repayment of federal student loans may be integrated into a mortgage repayment schedule to allow eligible applicants to accumulate home equity.\n\nAn eligible property is a property (1) that is designed as a dwelling\u00a0for occupancy by one to four families; (2) that is safe and habitable; (3) the occupancy of which will promote community revitalization; and (4) that is owned by HUD, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), a local land bank, the Department of Agriculture, or the Department of Veterans Affairs."
