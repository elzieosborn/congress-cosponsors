A proxy voting advice business provides, for a fee, recommendations to security holders on specific matters for which an issuer of securities has requested security holder approval or consent.\n\nIn addition, a proxy voting advice business must make this advice available to the issuer. Also, the security holder must be made aware of any written statement made by the issuer in response to this advice before the relevant meeting or vote."
