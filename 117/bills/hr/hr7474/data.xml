This bill requires the disclosure of costs associated with clinical trials and pharmaceutical research and development.

Specifically, the National Institutes of Health must create a publicly available repository of cost data from certain clinical trials that test the efficacy of drugs, biological products, and devices in human subjects. For each applicable trial, the registry must, among other information, include the total and per patient cost of the trial, as well as costs for personnel, health care services, and other categories of expenditures. Information must be added to the registry within one year of the trial's completion.

The bill also requires drug manufacturers to include their research and development expenditures for drugs and biological products in annual disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</summary>
