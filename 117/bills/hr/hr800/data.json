    "text": "Preference for Local Veteran Contractors Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to give preference to local contractors for purposes of awarding contracts for the construction or maintenance of a VA facility or for services provided to a particular VA facility or campus. Local contractors are those who submit a bid or proposal and have principal offices or locations within a 60-mile radius of the VA facility covered by the contract. Per the bill, the VA must publish a public notice explaining why a local contractor was not awarded a contract if another contractor is selected.\n\nThe bill also updates the order of priority for awarding contracts to small business concerns to include priority for local contractors."
