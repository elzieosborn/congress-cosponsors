  <summary date="2021-08-19T15:41:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Climate Change Education Act 

 This bill declares that the evidence for human-induced climate change is overwhelming and undeniable.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must establish a Climate Change Education Program to

 increase the climate literacy of the United States by broadening the understanding of human-induced climate change, including possible consequences, disproportionate impacts of such consequences, and potential solutions; apply the latest scientific and technological discoveries to provide learning opportunities to people of all ages; and help people understand and promote implementation of new technologies, programs, and incentives related to climate change, climate adaptation and mitigation, climate resilience, climate justice, and environmental justice. NOAA must also establish a grant program for climate change education.</summary>
