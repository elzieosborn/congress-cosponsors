This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to prescribe a motor vehicle safety standard that requires passenger motor vehicles manufactured after the effective date of such standard to be equipped with advanced drunk driving prevention technology. Advanced drunk driving prevention technology means a passive system that (1) monitors a driver's performance to identify impairment of a driver, (2) passively detects a blood alcohol level equal to and exceeding .08 blood alcohol content, or (3) detects impairment and prevents or limits vehicle operation.

DOT must work with manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles, suppliers, safety advocates, and other interested parties to accelerate the development of the advanced drunk driving prevention technology and ensure the integration of such technology into the vehicles available for sale at the earliest practicable date.</summary>
