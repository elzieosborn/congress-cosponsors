    "text": "This bill modifies requirements relating to coverage of certain telehealth services under Medicare. Specifically, the bill permanently allows telehealth services for substance-use disorders and mental health disorders to be provided via audio-only technology and without an initial in-person evaluation.\n\nSchedule III or IV controlled substances may also be prescribed online if a practitioner has conducted a telehealth evaluation with video; certain opioid agonists may be prescribed via audio-only technology if the beneficiary initially lacks access to video technology but receives a follow-up evaluation via video within 10 days.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must establish an interagency task force to study the utilization and effect of opioid agonist prescriptions that are issued via telehealth."
