This bill creates a framework under which students participating in competency-based education programs may receive federal student aid. Competency-based education refers to education that measures academic progress and attainment (1) by direct assessment of the student's mastery of competencies, (2) by expressing the student's mastery of competencies in terms of equivalent credit or clock hours, or (3) through a combination of both methods in addition to credit or clock hours.

The bill also prohibits the Department of Education from enforcing certain regulations related to the definition of credit hour.</summary>
