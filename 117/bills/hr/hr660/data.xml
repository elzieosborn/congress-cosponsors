  <summary date="2021-03-15T16:13:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Shovel-Ready Restoration Grants for Coastlines and Fisheries Act of 2021

This bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a grant program for states, tribal and local governments, and other entities to implement projects that restore a marine, estuarine, coastal, or Great Lakes habitat, or that provide adaptation to climate change.

NOAA must prioritize projects that (1) stimulate the economy; (2) begin within 90 days after an entity is awarded a grant; (3) employ fishermen who have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic or pay fishermen for the use of a fishing vessel; (4) demonstrate any required studies or permits have been completed or can be completed shortly after an award is made; or (5) include communities that may not have adequate resources, including communities of color, and low-income, tribal, indigenous, and rural communities.</summary>
