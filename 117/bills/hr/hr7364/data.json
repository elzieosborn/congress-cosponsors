Risk Rating 2.0 bases premium rates on an individual property's specific flood risk instead of the flood risk of a general location and property type.\n\nPolicyholders may elect to pay the previous rate until the Federal Emergency Management Agency performs several actions regarding Risk Rating 2.0, including\n\n publishing all data and methods used to calculate premium rates under Risk Rating 2.0, creating an online database where policyholders can see premium rates for their property using specified calculations, and publishing an assessment of the economic, social, and environmental impacts of Risk Rating 2.0."
