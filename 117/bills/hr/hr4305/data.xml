This bill requires states to support evidence-based crisis care services, such as crisis call centers, through the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant (MHBG). In addition, for each year in which the appropriations for that grant exceed a specified amount, states must expend a certain percentage of their MHBG allotment on crisis care services.

Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration may permit states and territories to use MHBG funding on crisis care services for individuals who are not part of the grant's target population. Currently, the MHBG targets adults with serious mental illnesses and children with serious emotional disturbances.</summary>
