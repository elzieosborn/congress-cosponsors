This bill funds and requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to states for promoting greater enrollment in health insurance coverage. Grants may be used by the state's primary health and human services agency for activities such as automatically enrolling uninsured individuals who are eligible for premium assistance tax credits in plans through the individual or small group market and establishing a state-level requirement for individuals to enroll in coverage.</summary>
