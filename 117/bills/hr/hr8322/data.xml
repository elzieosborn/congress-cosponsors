  <summary date="2022-09-21T21:28:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthening Tools to Obstruct and Prevent Fraud Act of 2022 or the STOP Fraud Act

This bill addresses issues of fraud and improper payments, including by establishing the Federal Real Antifraud Unified Directorate within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The bill requires agencies to designate any program exceeding certain payments thresholds as a program susceptible to significant improper payments and to implement proactive analytics for a high-risk area of each designated program.

The OMB must designate any program with outlays equal to or in excess of $50 billion with respect to the preceding fiscal year as a high-priority program.

An agency administering a high-priority program must develop a plan to implement anti-fraud controls that include digital identity-proofing solutions, threat intelligence, and proactive analytics. Such plan must take into consideration the administrative burden of implementing such anti-fraud controls.

The bill establishes in the Treasury a Program Integrity Fund.

The bill modifies improper payments provisions, including by requiring compliance reports by inspectors general of executive agencies at least every three fiscal years (currently, annually).</summary>
