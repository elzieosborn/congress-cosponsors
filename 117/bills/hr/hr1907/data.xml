This bill authorizes the Department of Justice to award technical assistance and training grants for states, local governments, Indian tribes, and domestic violence victim service providers to establish or operate lethality assessment programs. A lethality assessment program connects victims of domestic violence to service providers, helps first responders and others identify and respond to possibly lethal circumstances, and identifies victims who are at high risk for being seriously injured or killed.</summary>
