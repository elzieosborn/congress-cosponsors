Interior may allow field employees and members of the public to occupy and lease project quarters.\n\nField employees and members of the public shall be prohibited from subleasing housing units or quarters developed or leased in accordance with a housing partnership agreement under this bill, including all forms of short-term rentals.\n\nTo the maximum extent practicable, priority for occupancy in project quarters shall be given to field employees.\n\nInterior may collect, or authorize entities who have entered into partnership housing agreements under this bill to collect, rents directly from field employees and members of the public occupying housing units or quarters.\n\nThe bill modifies the lease-to-build program to allow Interior to lease federal land and interests in land to qualified persons for the construction of field employee quarters for any period not to exceed 60 years (under current law not to exceed 50 years)."
