  <summary date="2021-04-21T18:48:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes penalties for officeholders who engage in insurrection or rebellion against the United States.

The Department of Justice may bring a civil action against officeholders who engage in insurrection or rebellion, including such activity occurring before the date of the bill's enactment. Penalties include disqualification from federal or state office, removal from federal or state office, forfeiture of certain retirement benefits, and rescission of certain honors and commemorations.

 However, Congress may, upon a two-thirds vote, restore the ability of an individual to qualify for state or federal office and to receive benefits.</summary>
