This bill directs the Management Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assess certain active contracts for services related to security along the land border with Mexico awarded in FY2021 or earlier.

Specifically, this applies to any contract with a total value of $50 million or more, inclusive of contract options, relating to the procurement of services for DHS with respect to that border.

The assessment must include a strategy to enhance coordination, minimize overlap, and increase cost-effectiveness among such contracts.</summary>
