(The 1619 Project is an initiative that addresses the beginning of slavery in the United States.)\n\nSpecified federal agencies must reduce federal funds in a prorated amount to an elementary or secondary school that teaches this project or an LEA that supports its teaching in public schools. However, federal funding shall not be reduced for programs for low-income students (e.g., free or reduced-price lunch) or students with disabilities."
