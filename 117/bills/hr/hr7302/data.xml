This bill imposes sanctions on foreign persons (individuals or entities, including agencies of a foreign state) that are knowingly responsible for or have engaged in certain state-sponsored cyber activities, generally those that originate from outside of the United States and are reasonably likely to contribute to a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability. The bill also imposes sanctions on certain foreign persons that provide material support for such state-sponsored cyber activities.</summary>
