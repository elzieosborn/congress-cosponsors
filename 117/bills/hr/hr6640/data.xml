This bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to inspect each public housing project with more than 100 units at least every two years to determine whether the project and units are maintained in compliance with federal standards. Inspections must be performed by HUD employees or designees, and may not be performed by officers, employees, or agents of a public housing agency. HUD must make the results of these inspections publicly available online. These inspections are in addition to the annual inspection already required of every public housing project under current law.</summary>
