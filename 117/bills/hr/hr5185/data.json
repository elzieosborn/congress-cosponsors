The bill defines qualified environmental justice program as a program conducted by educational institutions that is designed to address, or improve data about, qualified environmental stressors (e.g., contaminations of air, water, soil, or food) for the primary purpose of improving health and economic outcomes of individuals residing in low-income areas or areas at risk of experiencing multiple exposures to environmental stressors.\n\nThe bill requires (1) the allocation of credit amounts to educational institutions over a five-year period, and (2) public disclosure of the identity of educational institutions receiving allocations and the amount of each allocation."
