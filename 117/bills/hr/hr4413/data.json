The board may make loans and loan guarantees to assist in financing infrastructure projects.\n\nFurther, the board must establish an executive committee, a risk management committee, an audit committee, and a compliance office.\n\nTo be eligible for financial assistance from the bank, an infrastructure project (1) must have a public benefit, as determined by the board; and (2) may not have a sole use or purpose that is private.\n\nAn infrastructure project must use iron, steel, and manufactured products that are made in the United States.\n\nThe bill also establishes accounting and reporting requirements. In particular, the Government Accountability Office must, within five years of this bill's enactment, submit a report to Congress evaluating the bank's activities."
