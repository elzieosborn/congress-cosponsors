  <summary date="2021-09-08T19:56:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Defund Cities that Defund the Police Act of 2021

This bill prohibits state or local governments that abolish or defund police departments from receiving certain Economic Development Administration grants or Community Development Block Grant funds.

Specifically, the bill applies to state or local governments that abolish or disband the police or significantly reduce the police department's budget without reallocating a portion of those funds to any other community policing program.

Further, a state or local government that abolishes or defunds a police department must return any Community Development Block Grant funds it has already received.</summary>
