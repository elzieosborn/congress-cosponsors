This bill requires the U.S. government to release and publicly disclose, within six months, all records related to the COINTELPRO operation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unless disclosure would cause harm. COINTELPRO was a series of covert and illegal projects aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic political organizations, including the Black Panther Party.

The bill requires the removal of J. Edgar Hoover's name from the FBI headquarters in the District of Columbia.

The bill establishes the COINTELPRO Records Review Board to review determinations by government offices that do not fully disclose their records after six months. The review board shall make recommendations to the President regarding whether files that have been only partially disclosed should be fully released.

The review board may request the Department of Justice to petition any U.S. court to release any information relevant to COINTELPRO that is held under court seal.</summary>
