  <summary date="2021-08-26T17:33:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Superfund Reinvestment Act

 This bill authorizes the use of amounts in the Hazardous Substance Superfund for environmental cleanup costs under the Superfund program (which provides funding to clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances).

Receipts and disbursements of the Hazardous Substance Superfund must (1) not be counted for purposes of the President's budget, the congressional budget, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, or the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010; (2) be exempt from general budget limitations imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays); and (3) be available only for the allowable uses specified for the Superfund.

This bill (1) reinstates and adjusts for inflation annually after 2021, the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate and the corporate environmental income tax threshold amount; and (2) extends the borrowing authority of the Superfund through 2029.</summary>
