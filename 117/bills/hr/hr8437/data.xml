This bill makes various changes to the allocation of revenues from offshore oil, gas, and wind projects on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico, including to increase the share of revenues paid to states. It also exempts the payments to states from sequestration (a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)</summary>
