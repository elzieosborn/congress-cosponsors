This bill authorizes the John E. Fogarty International Center for Advanced Study in the Health Sciences, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, to support training programs for obstetrician-gynecologists and subspecialists in urogynecology in low-income countries identified by the United Nations to be confronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The center must also develop a strategy to address physician shortages in such countries.</summary>
