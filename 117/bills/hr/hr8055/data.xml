  <summary date="2022-09-03T17:50:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthening School Security for Students Act

This bill prohibits a state educational agency (SEA) from receiving federal education funds unless each elementary and secondary school under the jurisdiction of the SEA hires two full-time school resource officers who are licensed to carry a firearm and are trained to prevent student violence for every 500 students in attendance at such school.

The bill also rescinds certain unobligated funds provided under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.</summary>
