This bill exempts certain vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products from vessel documentation requirements as well as coastwise endorsement requirements.

Specifically, the bill authorizes a vessel certificate of documentation (i.e., registration) to be issued for a vessel transporting crude oil or petroleum products, unless the vessel is (1) owned by a Russian national or Russia, (2) a Russian-flagged vessel, or (3) a vessel with any Russian crew member.

The bill also authorizes a coastwise endorsement to be issued for a vessel that is transporting oil or petroleum products. Such an endorsement allows a vessel to engage in certain trade.</summary>
