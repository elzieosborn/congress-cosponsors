This bill directs a federal law enforcement agency to notify the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)&#160;in the Department of the Treasury of an arrest of an individual under suspicion of participating in domestic terrorism or providing material support&#160;for terrorism. FinCEN must then order any appropriate financial institution to freeze that individual's assets.

The bill also sets forth provisions for contesting&#160;a freeze, unfreezing assets, and disposing&#160;of assets in the event of a conviction.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation must establish a national clearinghouse of incidents of homegrown lone wolf terrorism, domestic terrorism, and&#160;the provision of&#160;material support to terrorists.</summary>
