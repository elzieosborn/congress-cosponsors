Interior and USDA must develop plans to mitigate wildfire risk to communities located near the land.\n\nNo new permanent or temporary roads shall be constructed within the recreation areas except as necessary for public safety or to implement the wildfire mitigation plan.\n\n Interior or USDA, as appropriate, may take measures within such wilderness additions as are necessary to control fire, insects, and disease.\n\nAll federal surface and subsurface land within the recreation area or the wilderness additions is withdrawn from\n\n entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral leasing, geothermal leasing, or mineral materials."
