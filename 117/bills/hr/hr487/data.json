It must also reimburse each state 100% of costs incurred to build, modernize, or improve state and local data systems related to SNAP employment and training programs.\n\nFurther, USDA must commission a thorough national assessment of its SNAP employment and training programs to develop a strategy for continuous improvement to the programs."
