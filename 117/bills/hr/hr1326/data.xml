  <summary date="2021-09-17T15:52:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Energy Efficient Appliances Act

This bill revises and expands the Appliance and Equipment Standards Program of the Department of Energy (DOE). Under the existing program, DOE sets minimum energy efficiency standards for product categories of certain consumer products (e.g., appliances) or industrial equipment.

 This bill expands the categories of appliances and equipment for which DOE may issue energy conservation standards. It also expands the meaning of energy conservation standard to include a performance standard that prescribes a minimum level of water efficiency or a maximum quantity of water use.

In addition, the bill reduces the lead time for when the standards must come into effect after the standards are issued or updated.

If DOE misses deadlines for issuing certain energy efficiency, energy use, or water use standards, then states may set higher standards than the national standard.

Finally, the bill repeals the following rules issued by DOE:

 Energy Conservation Program for Appliance Standards: Procedures for Use in New or Revised Energy Conservation Standards and Test Procedures for Consumer Products and Commercial/Industrial Equipment, and Energy Conservation Program for Appliance Standards: Procedures for Evaluating Statutory Factors for Use in New or Revised Energy Conservation Standards.</summary>
