This bill adds assisting school-based mental health professionals to the list of community services in which undergraduate, graduate, and professional students may participate under the Federal Work-Study Program.

Specifically, the bill revises the definition of community services to include activities in which the student assists a mental health professional with appropriate tasks (e.g., administrative assistance) so long as the professional is (1) a school-based mental health services provider, or (2) an overseer of a school-based mental health services provider.</summary>
