  <summary date="2022-01-06T14:38:34Z" status="Passed House">VITAL Assessment Act

This bill implements changes related to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Integration to Academic Leadership (VITAL) program, which focuses on enhancing student veterans' academic success and retention by assisting with things like mental and physical health.

The VA must report on the program and establish best practices, goals, and measures for the program that are uniform among the VA's medical centers.

The bill also requires the VA to conduct outreach among the Armed Forces, veterans service organizations, institutions of higher learning, and noncollege degree programs regarding the VITAL program.

Additionally, the VA must assess the feasibility and advisability of including the suicide rate for student veterans in the National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report.</summary>
