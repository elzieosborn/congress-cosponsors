The strategic plan must (1) promote the chartering of minority depository institutions and entities that could be certified as community development financial institutions, and (2) describe actions to increase the number of depository institutions located in underserved areas.\n\nThe bill also decreases, beginning September 30, 2022, the cap on the surplus funds of the Federal Reserve banks. (Amounts exceeding this cap are deposited in the general fund of the Treasury.)"
