The bill defines an attraction operator as an individual or entity that owns or operates an amusement park, amusement arcade or parlor, or amusement device or concession, with the exclusion of any such business that also carries out gambling activities.\n\nUnder current law, these grants are made available to certain entertainment venues (i.e., places where events of a specific type are held), such as live venue operators or promoters, theatrical producers, and live performing arts organization operators."
