  <summary date="2021-07-07T20:01:41Z" status="Introduced in House">No Amnesty Act

This bill prohibits federal agencies from expending funds or resources to implement, administer, or enforce certain executive actions related to immigration, including actions that (1) prioritize the removal of certain aliens, such as those suspected of engaging in terrorism; (2) revoke an earlier executive order that required heightened vetting of aliens seeking admission as refugees; and (3) direct the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to develop a strategy to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Such executive actions shall have no force or effect.</summary>
