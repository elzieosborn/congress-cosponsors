This bill authorizes the President to make payments to manufacturers to increase supply-chain security if doing so is important to the national defense.

The President must submit a strategy to Congress that includes (1) a plan to use authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure the supply of medical materials essential to the national defense; and (2) plans to diversify, and address vulnerabilities in, supply chains for essential medical materials.

The President must submit to Congress annual progress reports through FY2025 evaluating the implementation of the strategy.</summary>
