This bill prohibits Armed Forces funding from being obligated or expended for the introduction of the Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, in the absence of a declaration of war, specific statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by an attack or imminent threat of attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or the Armed Forces.

In the case of a national emergency created by an attack (or threat of attack), funds may be used for only 60 days.

The House of Representatives or the Senate may not consider a bill or joint resolution that makes funds available in violation of these provisions.

The President shall, in the case of such introduction of the Armed Forces, submit to Congress a report that includes

 an analysis of the threat to be countered by the use of the Armed Forces; the specific objectives and justification for those objectives; and a description of the scope, duration, cost, and likelihood of success.</summary>
