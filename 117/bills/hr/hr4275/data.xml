  <summary date="2022-12-19T13:24:01Z" status="Passed House">Ensuring Phone and Internet Access Through Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Program Act of 2022

This bill requires reporting on enrollment in the Lifeline program and the Affordable Connectivity Program.

The Lifeline program is designed to reduce the cost of communications services for low-income consumers, and the Affordable Connectivity Program subsidizes the cost of broadband internet for low-income households. Both programs allow participants to qualify for assistance based on their participation in particular federal assistance programs (e.g., Medicaid or Federal Public Housing Assistance).

The Federal Communications Commission must report on enrollment in both programs, including the number of participants who qualify through each of the particular federal assistance programs.

Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on outreach and publicity efforts to promote participation in the Lifeline program and the Affordable Connectivity Program.</summary>
