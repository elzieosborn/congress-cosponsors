Both programs allow participants to qualify for assistance based on their participation in particular federal assistance programs (e.g., Medicaid or Federal Public Housing Assistance).\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission must report on enrollment in both programs, including the number of participants who qualify through each of the particular federal assistance programs.\n\nAdditionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on outreach and publicity efforts to promote participation in the Lifeline program and the Affordable Connectivity Program."
