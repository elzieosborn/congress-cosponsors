Currently, a court is barred from reviewing any claim by a non-U.S. national arising from a decision by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against a non-U.S. national. Under this bill, a court is only barred from reviewing a claim by a non-U.S. national challenging a discretionary decision by DOJ to take such actions."
