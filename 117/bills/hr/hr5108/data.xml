  <summary date="2021-09-20T17:11:29Z" status="Introduced in House">1st Lt. Hugh Conor McDowell Safety in Armed Forces Equipment Act of 2021

This bill requires the Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy to jointly implement a five-year pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of using data recorders to monitor, assess, and improve the readiness and safety of the operation of military tactical vehicles (e.g., Army Strykers).

The program must be carried out at not fewer than one military station in the United States that (1) contains the necessary force structure, equipment, and maneuver training ranges to collect necessary driver and vehicle data; and (2) represents at least one of the five training ranges that did not track unit location during training, as identified by the Government Accountability Office.</summary>
