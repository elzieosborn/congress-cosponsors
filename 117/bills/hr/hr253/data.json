These programs provide care to individuals living with neurological diseases and conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury).\n\nIn carrying out the survey, the Administration for Community Living (ACL) must identify\n\n successful programs, programs that serve younger people, and financial support provided to programs by the ACL. In addition, the ACL must develop best practices for establishing adult day programs.\n\nThe ACL must also award grants to programs that support younger people."
