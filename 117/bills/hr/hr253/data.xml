This bill requires a survey of, and establishes grants for, adult day programs. These programs provide care to individuals living with neurological diseases and conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury).

In carrying out the survey, the Administration for Community Living (ACL) must identify

 successful programs, programs that serve younger people, and financial support provided to programs by the ACL. In addition, the ACL must develop best practices for establishing adult day programs.

The ACL must also award grants to programs that support younger people.</summary>
