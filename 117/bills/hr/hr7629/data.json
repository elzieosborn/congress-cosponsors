CISA must also consolidate voluntary recommendations for the development, maintenance, and operation of such systems. The recommendations must include measures to protect systems against cyber-related vulnerabilities, risks, and attacks.\n\nThe bill also requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study and report on federal actions to support the cybersecurity of commercial satellite systems, including with respect to critical infrastructure sectors. In carrying out its study and report, the GAO must coordinate with designated federal agencies."
