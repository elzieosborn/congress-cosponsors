 This bill establishes a grant program through which the Department of Education may award grants to eligible students attending institutions of higher education to pursue careers in law enforcement.

A grant recipient must agree to serve as a full-time law enforcement officer for at least four years within eight years after completing the grant recipient's course of study. If the grant recipient completes less than the required years of service, the scholarship must be treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan that is subject to repayment.</summary>
