This bill imposes security-related requirements with respect to political appointees in the Executive Office of the President.

Under this bill, such a political appointee (1) may be employed in the office only if the appointment is clearly consistent with national security; and (2) may not have a security clearance or access to classified information unless the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants such clearance or access, unless the President nullifies the FBI's decision to deny clearance or access.

If the President nullifies the FBI's decision to deny clearance or access to such an appointee, the President must report to Congress within 30 days explaining the reasons for the nullification.</summary>
