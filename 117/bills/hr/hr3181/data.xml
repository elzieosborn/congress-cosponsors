This bill prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from using the authority under the Public Health Service Act to hire or pay the salary of officers or employees who are not already receiving pay under such authority. Currently, the EPA may use such authority to set higher pay limits for such employees or officers than those provided under typical civil service hiring authorities.</summary>
