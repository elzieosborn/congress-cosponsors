    "text": "Public Safety and Wildlife Protection Act\n\nThis bill bans steel-jaw leghold traps and Conibear traps and establishes penalties for violating this ban.\n\nSteel-jaw leghold traps are certain spring-powered devices with steel jaws that are designed to snap closed on animals. Conibear traps consist of metal frames hinged at the center point and powered by two torsion springs that create a scissor-like action designed to kill an animal by snapping its spine. Cage traps, box traps, suitcase-type live beaver traps, and mouse or rat snap traps are not included in the ban.\n\nThe Department of the Interior must pay a reward for information that leads to a conviction of a violation of this bill, unless the information was provided by on duty officers or employees of federal, state, or local governments. The reward must be 50% of the penalty paid."
