This bill requires the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to incorporate a macroeconomic impact analysis in their cost estimates for major legislation.

 The macroeconomic impact analysis (commonly referred to as dynamic scoring) must include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, tax revenues, the sources of financing new outlays, the total debt of the federal government, international trade, international capital flows, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.</summary>
