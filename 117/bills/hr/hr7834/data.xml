This bill prohibits the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services from including the development of anti-racism plans (i.e., plans to address systemic racism in health care) as a qualifying clinical practice improvement activity under the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), as described in a November 2021 rule. (MIPS is an incentive program under Medicare that allows health care professionals to receive payment adjustments based on certain performance measures.)</summary>
