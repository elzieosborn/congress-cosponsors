  <summary date="2022-06-27T17:51:07Z" status="Passed House">Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act 

This bill address access to financial services, diversity in various financial institutions and establishments, and other related issues.

Access to credit, mortgages, and banking services are expanded, including by

 prohibiting discrimination with respect to credit transactions on the basis of an applicant's sexual orientation, gender identity, or location based on zip code or census tract; establishing language translation requirements for residential mortgage applications; and providing funding set-asides for minority lending institutions. The bill expands the support of, and access to, minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions and establishes an impact bank designation for small institutions that predominately lend to low-income borrowers.

Further, the Federal Reserve Board must carry out its duties in a manner that supports the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in employment, income, wealth, and access to affordable credit.

Additionally, the bill requires financial institutions to report information relating to diversity policies and lending practices.

 Retail businesses must accept cash as a form of payment for sales in amounts less than $2,000 and are prohibited from charging cash-paying customers a higher price.

Finally, the bill commissions various reports and studies, including a report from the Government Accountability Office on public housing for the homeless.</summary>
