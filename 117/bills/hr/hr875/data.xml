This bill prohibits giving assistance, such as various types of economic support or military training, to countries that opposed U.S. positions on more than 50% of the recorded votes in the most recent United Nations session.

A country may be exempted if there has been a fundamental change in the country's leadership and policies and the Department of State determines that the country will no longer oppose the U.S. position. The President may also exempt a country for U.S. national security interests.</summary>
