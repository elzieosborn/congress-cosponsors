 This bill allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to use the collaborative project delivery method for certain water infrastructure projects (e.g., building and upgrading wastewater and drinking water treatment systems). This method involves collaboration among those involved at various stages of a project from design through completion of construction.

The bill also requires the EPA and USACE to study the use of the collaborative project delivery method in these projects and make the results public.</summary>
