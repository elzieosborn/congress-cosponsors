It also requires the Government Accountability Office to study the availability and affordability of childcare for residents of public housing.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development must award the grants to eligible entities, which include community development financial institutions, public housing authorities, licensed childcare providers, government entities, housing developers, and consortia of such entities. Entities must use the grants for designing, planning, constructing, acquiring, renovating, or otherwise supporting new or existing facilities where childcare and housing providers are on the same premises."
