Specifically, the Department of Energy must first (1) complete and publish the results of the study titled Quantification of Methane Emissions from Marginal (Small Producing) Oil and Gas Wells, and (2) provide a period of at least 90 days for public comment on the application of the study's results.\n\nThe EPA must take the results of the study into consideration when finalizing the rule."
