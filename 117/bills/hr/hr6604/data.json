The VA must accept such a certification as proof that the individual is transferring fewer than 12 credits.\n\nThe VA must provide a certificate of eligibility (to demonstrate proof of full educational assistance entitlement) to individuals who make the certification and acknowledge that if 12 or more credits are transferred (1) they may not be deemed to be someone who did not receive such credits, and (2) the VA must rescind the certificate of eligibility in such cases.\n\nThe VA must notify individuals who are eligible to make such a certification and receive a certificate of eligibility.\n\nThe act also removes the requirement that an individual transferring a Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement must specify the period for which the transfer must be effective for each dependent who is designated to receive the transfer."
