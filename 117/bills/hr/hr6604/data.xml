  <summary date="2023-01-05T17:27:25Z" status="Public Law">Veterans Eligible to Transfer School (VETS) Credit Act

This act addresses eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance for individuals who are transferring credits due to the closure or disapproval of a program of education.

Currently, an individual who transfers fewer than 12 credits from a program of education that is closed or disapproved must be deemed to have not received such credits, and the period for which the entitlement is not charged must be the entire period of the individual's enrollment in the program.

Under the act, the VA must require an individual to certify in writing the transfer of fewer than 12 credits from a program of education that is closed or disapproved. The VA must accept such a certification as proof that the individual is transferring fewer than 12 credits.

The VA must provide a certificate of eligibility (to demonstrate proof of full educational assistance entitlement) to individuals who make the certification and acknowledge that if 12 or more credits are transferred (1) they may not be deemed to be someone who did not receive such credits, and (2) the VA must rescind the certificate of eligibility in such cases.

The VA must notify individuals who are eligible to make such a certification and receive a certificate of eligibility.

The act also removes the requirement that an individual transferring a Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement must specify the period for which the transfer must be effective for each dependent who is designated to receive the transfer.</summary>
