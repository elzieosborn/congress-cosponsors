Additionally, the VHA and the VBA must provide such materials with the determination the VA provides to the claimant in connection with a claim for compensation.\n\nIn a claim for compensation arising from MST experienced by a veteran who is enrolled in the VA health care system and consents to the notification system, the VBA must automatically notify the VHA before the veteran (1) participates in a medical examination, hearing, or other relevant event; or (2) receives a determination from the VA in connection with the claim for compensation."
