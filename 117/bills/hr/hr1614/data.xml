This bill removes various immigration-related penalties pertaining to marijuana and addresses related issues.

Specifically, offenses involving marijuana use, possession, or distribution shall not be grounds for (1) barring an alien from admission into the United States, (2) removing an alien from the United States, or (3) finding that an alien lacks good moral character for immigration purposes.

An alien who was previously barred or deported due to such marijuana-related offenses shall be readmitted into the United States.

Under this bill, the distribution of marijuana shall not constitute an aggravated felony for immigration purposes.

Furthermore, the bill repeals a statutory provision stating that habitual drunkards lack good moral character for immigration purposes.</summary>
