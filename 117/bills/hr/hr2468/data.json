The Department of Commerce must (1) issue uniform standards that define the term all manufacturing processes for purposes of this bill, and (2) take into consideration and seek to maximize the jobs benefited or created in the production of the construction material.\n\nThe bill requires that all steel, iron, manufactured products, non-ferrous metals, plastic, concrete and aggregates, glass (including optical glass), lumber, and drywall used in these programs be produced in the United States.\n\nIncludes within infrastructure addressed by this bill federal-aid highways, railroads, public transportation, civil aviation, drinking water, and stormwater."
