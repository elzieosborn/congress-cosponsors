This bill extends various Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programs.

First, the bill permanently extends the VA's authority to administer a dental insurance plan for veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system and certain survivors and dependents of veterans.

Next, the bill extends through FY2022 the expansion of the program that authorizes payments and allowances for beneficiary travel in connection with veterans who are receiving care from Vet Centers.

Finally, the bill extends authority through December 16, 2026, for the pilot program under which the VA may accept donations of real property or facilities from specified entities (e.g., a state or local authority).</summary>
