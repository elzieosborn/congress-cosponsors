It also requires the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, the Department of Energy, and various other federal agencies to support research, development, and related activities concerning drones.\n\nAdditionally, the bill (1) limits the Federal Aviation Administration's authority to regulate drones that are flown for research purposes and meet conditions to limit risks to other aircraft; and (2) prohibits the purchase or operation of a drone from China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia, except for research to improve U.S. capabilities to counter drones."
