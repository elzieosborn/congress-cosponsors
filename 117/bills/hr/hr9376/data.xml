  <summary date="2023-07-31T20:51:43Z" status="Introduced in House">National Drone and Advanced Air Mobility Initiative Act

This bill establishes the National Drone and Advanced Air Mobility Initiative within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to advance relevant technologies and capabilities related to unmanned aircraft systems (or drones). It also requires the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, the Department of Energy, and various other federal agencies to support research, development, and related activities concerning drones.

Additionally, the bill (1) limits the Federal Aviation Administration's authority to regulate drones that are flown for research purposes and meet conditions to limit risks to other aircraft; and (2) prohibits the purchase or operation of a drone from China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia, except for research to improve U.S. capabilities to counter drones.</summary>
