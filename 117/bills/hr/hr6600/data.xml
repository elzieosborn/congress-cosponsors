  <summary date="2022-03-30T12:03:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Ethiopia Stabilization, Peace, and Democracy Act

This bill imposes sanctions and addresses other issues related to the conflict in Ethiopia.

The President must impose property-blocking sanctions (and visa-blocking sanctions in the case of an individual) against a foreign entity or individual that has taken certain actions to expand or extend the civil war or other conflicts in Ethiopia.

The bill prohibits assistance, with certain exceptions, to Ethiopia's security forces unless the Department of State certifies to Congress that Ethiopia's government has ceased all military operations associated with the civil war and met other specified conditions.

The Department of the Treasury must instruct U.S. representatives at international financial institutions to oppose, with some exceptions, such institutions providing loans or assistance to the governments of Ethiopia or Eritrea. Furthermore, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation may not provide certain support for projects in Ethiopia. These restrictions must terminate after the State Department certifies that certain conditions, such as a cessation of military operations associated with the civil war in Ethiopia, have been met.

The President may provide support for activities necessary to preserve evidence of atrocities in Ethiopia and to pursue accountability for such atrocities.

Within 90 days of this bill's enactment, the State Department must report to Congress a determination of whether actions in Ethiopia by the armed forces of Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Tigrayan Peoples Liberation Front, and other armed actors constitute genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity.</summary>
