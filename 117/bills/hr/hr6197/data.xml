This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to study the establishment of a designated central program office within DOD to oversee all academic engagement programs focusing on cyber talent across DOD.

Upon completion of the study, DOD must determine whether it should establish a designated central program office responsible for each specified academic engagement program (e.g., recruitment or retention programs) across DOD. Additionally, DOD must justify a decision not to establish such a program office.</summary>
