Specifically, the bill requires each agency to post a safety plan on its website that includes (1) the agency's mitigation efforts, including personal protective equipment provided and testing for on-site workers; (2) guidance on cleaning protocols and occupancy limits; (3) protections for employees whose work requires them to travel off-site; and (4) protocols that ensure the continuity of operations. Each agency must communicate the plan to new employees, contractors, and subcontractors not later than 30 days after an employee is hired or a contract is entered.\n\nEach agency's Office of Inspector General must report on whether the agency has published and implemented its safety plan."
