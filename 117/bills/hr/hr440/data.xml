  <summary date="2021-02-26T16:48:32Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill recognizes the Alaska Native group corporation of Alexander Creek as an Alaska Native village corporation eligible for certain land and benefits.

Alexander Creek must file any amendments to its corporate charter that are necessary to convert from a Native group corporation to a Native village corporation.

In addition, the bill requires the Department of the Interior to open negotiations with Alexander Creek to settle Alexander Creek's aboriginal land claims and any other claims it has against the United States.

Finally, Alexander Creek must notify its members that (1) they will cease to receive benefits from Cook Inlet Region Incorporated (CIRI) individually as at-large shareholders, and (2) all future resource payments from CIRI will be made to the village corporation. CIRI is not liable under any state, federal, or local law for damages related to that payment cessation.</summary>
