This bill prohibits the U.S. government from charging U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents for their evacuation during the withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces from Afghanistan.

Specifically, the Department of State must waive repayment for travel expenses incurred on behalf of such an individual as part of the evacuation from Afghanistan. Similarly, no federal employee may solicit or accept funds from such an individual as a condition of using government-provided transportation to repatriate the individual to the United States.</summary>
