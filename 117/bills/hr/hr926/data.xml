  <summary date="2021-05-04T18:08:41Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides supplemental funding to the Department of Health and Human Services for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. This program supports voluntary home visits by social workers and other professionals for families with young children in at-risk communities.

The funds may be used to

 expand access to virtual visits, such as by acquiring necessary technology for participating families; provide for specified training and administrative costs, including hazard pay; and meet emergency needs of participating families for diapers, prepaid grocery cards, and other supplies. An entity that receives these funds must maintain existing staffing and funding levels, coordinate as practicable with local diaper banks when providing emergency supplies, and meet other conditions.</summary>
