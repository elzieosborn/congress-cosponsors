This program supports voluntary home visits by social workers and other professionals for families with young children in at-risk communities.\n\nThe funds may be used to\n\n expand access to virtual visits, such as by acquiring necessary technology for participating families; provide for specified training and administrative costs, including hazard pay; and meet emergency needs of participating families for diapers, prepaid grocery cards, and other supplies. An entity that receives these funds must maintain existing staffing and funding levels, coordinate as practicable with local diaper banks when providing emergency supplies, and meet other conditions."
