    "text": "Housing Emergencies Lifeline Program Act of 2022 or the HELP Act of 2022\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a database of information regarding evictions from federally assisted dwellings, limits the inclusion of information relating to landlord-tenant actions in consumer reports, and otherwise provides eviction-related assistance and services.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires states and local entities receiving federal housing assistance to submit to HUD, for inclusion in the database, certain information regarding evictions from assisted dwelling units in the past year. Such information must include, among other things, the reason for eviction and whether the household was represented by legal counsel in the proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits a consumer reporting agency from making a consumer report containing an eviction or item related to an eviction from a rental dwelling or any adverse information related to rent or utility arrears.\n\nFurther, the bill authorizes additional Emergency Solutions Grants to provide legal counsel and pay court fees for tenants subject to or at risk of eviction.\n\nFinally, HUD must require owners of federally assisted rental units to (1) annually provide information to each tenant regarding the rights and responsibilities of the owner with respect to eviction and local organizations and resources that can provide assistance in eviction-related matters; and (2) upon provision of an eviction notice, information stating the reason for the eviction. HUD must also establish an eviction hotline to provide assistance to tenants of these units."
