This bill establishes that certain data and determinations from a request for emergency use authorization for a drug, biological product, or medical device may apply to later regulatory procedures for that product.

Specifically, data generated to support a request for emergency use authorization may constitute valid scientific evidence to be considered for various later submissions to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including a request for market approval.

Also, when granting emergency use authorization for a medical device, if the FDA determines that the device performs certain simple low-risk examinations or procedures, that determination shall apply to certain other regulatory submissions unless additional information contradicts that determination.</summary>
