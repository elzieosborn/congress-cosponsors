This bill establishes resources and a program to address cybersecurity of elementary and secondary schools.

First, the bill directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to establish an information exchange to disseminate information, best practices, training, and resources to improve cybersecurity in elementary and secondary schools.

In addition, CISA must establish a registry to track cyber incidents affecting information technology systems that are owned or managed by schools and educational agencies. Schools and educational agencies may voluntarily submit information to the registry.

Finally, the bill requires CISA to establish a program to address cybersecurity threats to school information systems.</summary>
