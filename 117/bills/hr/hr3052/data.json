    "text": "Digital Trade for Development Act\n\nThis bill prohibits the President from designating any country as a beneficiary developing country if the country restricts digital trade to the detriment of U.S. development goals, strategic interests, or competitiveness. A country with such designation receives preferential trade treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences.\n\nWhen designating any country as a beneficiary developing country, the President must, in addition to other factors, consider the extent to which such country has (1) refrained from imposing or eliminated digital trade barriers, and (2) taken steps to support consumer protections and the privacy of personal information online and to extend the benefits of digital trade to all."
