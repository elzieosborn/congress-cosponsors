An employee may also bring an action against the employer for wrongful death or serious injury related to the COVID-19 vaccine administration, if the employee received the vaccine solely to comply with the employer's mandate. An employee may recover damages (actual, compensatory, and punitive), injunctive relief, attorney's fees and costs, and other appropriate relief."
