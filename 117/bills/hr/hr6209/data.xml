This bill requires each military department to submit to the Department of Defense (DOD) a report on racial, ethnic, and sex demographics in the military justice system during the preceding year. There must be separate reports for the Navy and Marine Corps as well as for the Air Force and Space Force.

DOD must forward such reports to Congress.

DOD must prescribe a policy requiring information on the race and ethnicity of accused individuals to be included to the maximum extent practicable in the annual report regarding sexual assaults involving members of the Armed Forces. Such information must be made publicly available, but information may be excluded based on privacy concerns, impacts on accountability efforts, or other matters of importance.</summary>
