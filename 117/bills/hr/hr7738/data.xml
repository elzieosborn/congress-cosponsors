  <summary date="2023-08-08T19:01:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Security Clearance Portability for Departing Servicemembers Act of 2022

This bill addresses the security clearance of former members of the Armed Forces or former civilian employees of the Department of Defense (DOD) after separation or retirement who require security clearance for employment as covered DOD contractors.

Specifically, during the one-year period following the separation or retirement, DOD must treat the previously held security clearance as an active clearance for purposes of former members or employees retaining employment with covered DOD contractors. During the two-year period following that year, DOD must ensure the adjudication of any request submitted by such employee for reactivation of a previously held security clearance for purposes of employment is completed not later than 180 days after the date of submission.</summary>
