Currently, nonexempt, nonbank issuers must register their securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a fiscal year in which the issuer has total assets exceeding $10 million and a class of equity security held by either (1) 2,000 persons, or (2) 500 persons who are not accredited investors.\n\nThe bill increases the asset threshold to $15 million and requires the SEC to determine by rule the number of beneficial owners who hold a security or the amount of market capitalization beyond which registration by the issuer is required."
