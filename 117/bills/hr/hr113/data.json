    "text": "Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2021\n\nThis bill requires research and education activities related to triple-negative breast cancer. The cells of these breast cancers are negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and excess HER2 protein, so they do not respond to hormonal therapy medicines or medicines that target the HER2 protein receptors.\n\nSpecifically, the National Institutes of Health must conduct and support research into the disease.\n\nAdditionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services Administration must develop information about triple-negative breast cancer, including information regarding the elevated risk for minority women, for the public and for health care providers."
