This bill authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to issue up to ten Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) licenses each year to certain applicants. An SBIC is a privately owned company, licensed and regulated by the SBA, which invests in small businesses through debt and equity.

A license issued under the bill must be awarded to an applicant

 that would otherwise be issued a license except that the management of the applicant does not satisfy certain qualification requirements such as investment experience; where the fund managers have a documented record of successful business experience, a record of business management success, or knowledge in the particular industry or business in which the investment strategy is being pursued; and that will make at least 25% of its investments in specified areas and businesses (e.g., low-income communities, businesses owned or controlled by individuals in underserved communities, and rural areas). The SBA must prioritize applicants that are located in states with fewer licenses and establish a streamlined application process for those licenses.</summary>
