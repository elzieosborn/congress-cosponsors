Such entities are exempt from liability if they operate consistent with state or federal guidelines or requirements related to reopening and follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and any other federal or state agency to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, this exemption does not apply to acts that constitute gross negligence or to actions brought by a government entity in a regulatory, supervisory, or enforcement capacity."
