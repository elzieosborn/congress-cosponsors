This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to pay a state, state agency, or political subdivision of a state $525 as a plot or internment allowance for spouses and children of veterans who are buried in a cemetery owned by the state, agency, or political subdivision. Specifically, the bill requires the VA to pay a plot or internment allowance for spouses, surviving spouses (including if they have remarried), or minor children (those under 21 or under 23 if they are attending an approved educational institution). The VA may pay the allowance for unmarried adult children of certain veterans.</summary>
