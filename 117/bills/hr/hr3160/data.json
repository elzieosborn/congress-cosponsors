Under the program, NOAA may award grants to coastal states with approved working waterfront plans in place to preserve and expand access to coastal waters for people engaged in fishing, aquaculture, boat building, and other water-dependent businesses.\n\nIn addition, NOAA is authorized to award grants to coastal states for the purpose of developing or revising working waterfront plans.\n\nStates are allowed to allocate any grant money received to eligible Indian tribes, local governments, and other entities. Each state that is awarded a grant must contribute at least 25% of matching funds towards the total cost of the project carried out with the grant, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nThe bill establishes the Working Waterfronts Preservation Loan Fund to provide loans to coastal states for the purpose of implementing working waterfront plans."
