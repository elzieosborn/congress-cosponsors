    "text": "Bonding Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2021\n\nThis bill revises bonding requirements for oil and gas development on public land leased from the federal government. Such bonds are required to ensure oil and gas developers have adequate financial resources for implementing reclamation plans to restore public land after oil and gas development (e.g., drilling operations) ceases.\n\nSpecifically, the bill increases the amount of bond that oil and gas developers must provide prior to conducting surface-disturbing activities and requires such amounts to adjust every three years for inflation. In addition, the bill sets fees to cover the cost for inspection and enforcement with respect to such leases.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish uniform standards for all interim and final reclamation plans. Interior and USDA may not release any bond amounts until the standards have been met by oil and gas developers and the inspection fees have been paid.\n\nFinally, the bill gives the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the authority to obtain and retain adequate financial assurances (e.g., bonds) from nonfederal entities to repair potential damages to resources of the National Wildlife Refuge System prior to the commencement of activities related to mineral development, such as oil and gas operations."
