  <summary date="2022-04-26T19:11:44Z" status="Introduced in House">Safe Medicine Act

This bill addresses issues related to the manufacture of drugs, including essential medicines.

The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs must jointly develop and implement a strategy to increase the domestic production of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs.

If the Food and Drug Administration determines that a drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured in a country that may be producing contaminated drugs or ingredients due to systemic manufacturing-related problems, the labeling for that drug or ingredient must have a boxed warning about the potential for contamination.

For government procurement purposes, the President's authority to waive certain purchasing requirements that discriminate against foreign products may not be used to waive any preferences for goods that are essential medicines, medical countermeasures, or critical inputs.</summary>
