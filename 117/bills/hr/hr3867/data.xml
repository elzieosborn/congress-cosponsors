This bill requires states to take certain actions to facilitate absentee voting for federal elections.

First, the bill requires each state to establish an absentee ballot tracking program to track and confirm receipt of absentee ballots for federal elections. The Election Assistance Commission must make payments to states for establishing these programs.

Next, the bill requires each state to provide in each county secured drop boxes at which individuals may drop off their completed absentee ballots for federal elections.

These drop boxes must be (1) available beginning 45 days before the election; (2) accessible to individuals with disabilities and individuals with limited proficiency in the English language; (3) accessible by public transit; (4) available during all hours of the day; and (5) located in all communities within the county, including rural communities and on tribal lands. States must also post the requirements for absentee ballots to be counted and tabulated in the election.

Further, the bill outlines additional requirements that a state must meet in determining the number and location of drop boxes.

The bill also requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop alternatives to signature matching for verifying the identity of an individual who is voting by absentee ballot.</summary>
