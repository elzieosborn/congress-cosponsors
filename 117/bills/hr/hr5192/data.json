    "text": "Clean Hydrogen Production and Investment Tax Credit Act of 2021\n\nThis bill allows a new tax credit for the production of qualified clean hydrogen. The bill defines qualified clean hydrogen as hydrogen produced through a process that, as compared to hydrogen produced by steam-methane reforming, achieves a percentage reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that is not less than 40%.\n\nThe bill also (1) expands the tax credit for electricity produced from renewable resources if the electricity is used to produce clean hydrogen, (2) allows an election to treat clean hydrogen production facilities as energy property for purposes of the energy tax credit, and (3) eliminates the excise tax credit for liquefied hydrogen."
