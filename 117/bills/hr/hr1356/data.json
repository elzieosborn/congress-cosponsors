    "text": "Resident Commuter Toll Relief Act \n\nThis bill limits how public authorities may use toll revenues.\n\nUnder current law, public authorities may use toll revenues from the operation of a toll facility for (1) debt service with respect to projects for which the tolls are authorized, (2) a reasonable return on investment with respect to such projects, (3) toll facility improvements, and (4) certain payments under an applicable public-private partnership agreement for the toll facility.\n\nCurrent law also provides public authorities with the flexibility to use such revenues for any other purpose if they certify annually that the toll facility is being adequately maintained. This bill eliminates that flexibility. However, the bill specifies that toll revenues may be used for toll discounts, rebates, or credits for commuters."
