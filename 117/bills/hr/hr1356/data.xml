This bill limits how public authorities may use toll revenues.

Under current law, public authorities may use toll revenues from the operation of a toll facility for (1) debt service with respect to projects for which the tolls are authorized, (2) a reasonable return on investment with respect to such projects, (3) toll facility improvements, and (4) certain payments under an applicable public-private partnership agreement for the toll facility.

Current law also provides public authorities with the flexibility to use such revenues for any other purpose if they certify annually that the toll facility is being adequately maintained. This bill eliminates that flexibility. However, the bill specifies that toll revenues may be used for toll discounts, rebates, or credits for commuters.</summary>
