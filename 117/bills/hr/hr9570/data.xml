This bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to propose and finalize rules to allow entities to deliver regulatory documents to investors electronically. The SEC must establish a mechanism for investors to opt out of electronic delivery and receive paper documents instead. If the SEC does not finalize rules within one year after enactment, the bill allows for electronic delivery of these documents.</summary>
