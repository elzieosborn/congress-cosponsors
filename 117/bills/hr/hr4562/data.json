In addition, such a parent shall be deemed to have violated certain crimes related to assisting or abetting an alien's attempt to enter into the United States in violation of immigration laws, even if the parent's actions would fall under an exception for a first offense in assisting or abetting certain family members.\n\nIf the parent is a lawful permanent resident, that parent shall be ineligible for any federal public benefit."
