This bill reauthorizes through FY2026 the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and otherwise revises the program.

Specifically, the bill revises the COPS program by

 restoring authority to make COPS grants for hiring and rehiring additional career law enforcement officers, allowing the federal cost share to be 75% for the duration of such grants, and specifying that at least 30% of the amount made available for such grants must be used for school resource officers.</summary>
