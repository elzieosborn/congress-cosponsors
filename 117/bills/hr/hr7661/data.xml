This bill prohibits credit reporting agencies from providing a credit report not initiated by a consumer if the report is being provided on the basis that the consumer has had a credit inquiry regarding a home mortgage loan. This practice, known as producing a trigger lead, provides notice to other mortgage lenders that the consumer is seeking a mortgage loan.</summary>
