  <summary date="2022-11-10T21:28:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Emergency Migration Response Act of 2022

This bill authorizes the President to declare an extraordinary migration event that is of such magnitude that the existing infrastructure, including Department of Homeland Security (DHS) staffing levels and relevant government resources, is unable to provide an appropriate government response.

Such a declaration authorizes DHS to take various actions to respond to the migration event, such as (1) utilizing the capabilities of the Southwest Border Coordination Center, (2) reassigning U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers and interpreters to U.S. Customs and Border Protection border facilities, and (3) surging resources to process migrants in their countries of origin.</summary>
