This bill requires the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs to conduct a risk assessment of properties that receive low-income housing assistance to identify properties with the greatest risk of exposing children under six years old to lead hazards. The office must develop an action plan for remediation and control of lead hazards in identified properties and submit a report on low-income housing properties with lead hazards, including the number of children under six living at those properties.</summary>
