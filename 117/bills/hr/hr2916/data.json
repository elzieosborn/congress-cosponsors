Covered veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health care system.\n\nThe trials must include a control group and an experimental group that are of similar sizes and structures and represent the demographics of the veteran population.\n\nData collected in the trials must be preserved to facilitate further research.\n\nUnder the bill, participation in the clinical trials does not affect a covered veteran's eligibility or entitlement to other VA benefits."
