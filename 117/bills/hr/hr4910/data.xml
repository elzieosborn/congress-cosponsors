This bill establishes the State Cyber Resiliency Grant Program to assist state, local, and tribal governments in preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to cyber threats.

Under this program, the Department of Homeland Security may award grants to a state for the development and implementation of an active cyber resiliency plan. Such plan must be tailored to achieve specific objectives, including

 enhancement of the response and resiliency of computer networks, industrial control systems, and communications systems against cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities; implementation of continuous vulnerability assessments and threat mitigation practices; adoption of cybersecurity best practices by entities performing cybersecurity functions within a state; and confirmation that continuity of communications and data networks would be maintained in the event of a catastrophic disruption of such communications or networks.</summary>
