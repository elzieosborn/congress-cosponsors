    "text": "This bill modifies factors that must be considered in allocating community development disaster recovery block grants.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from establishing a minimum threshold dollar amount when determining whether a ZIP code's damages related to housing are sufficient to qualify. Instead, the bill requires HUD to consider any ZIP code for which the median household income is less than 75% of the national median household income as having sufficient damage for that purpose."
