  <summary date="2022-01-31T19:24:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo Accountability Act

This bill authorizes the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on certain senior officials of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and addresses related issues.

The President may impose sanctions on senior CCP officials who have engaged in or provided support for (1) any malign disinformation campaign or political warfare operation against the United States; (2) the theft of intellectual property belonging to a U.S. individual or entity; (3) actions undermining Taiwan's sovereignty; or (4) restrictions against the practice of religion in China, including the forced closure of any place of worship.

The President must impose sanctions on four named senior CCP officials.

The Department of State must report to Congress on whether any CCP Politburo members meet the criteria for sanctions under various authorities. (The Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee are China's highest decision-making bodies.)</summary>
