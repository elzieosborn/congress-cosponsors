This bill expands early in-person voting.

Specifically, the bill requires each state to allow individuals to vote in federal elections during an early voting period of at least 15 days.

Further, states must ensure that polling places are accessible by public transportation and located in rural areas.

The Election Assistance Commission must issue certain standards for early voting, including the nondiscriminatory geographic placement of polling places.

Finally, states must begin processing and scanning ballots cast during the early voting period at least 14 days prior to election day. However, states cannot tabulate ballots before the polls close on election day.</summary>
