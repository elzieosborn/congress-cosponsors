The bill also addresses Members' salaries and travel expenses.\n\nThe bill withholds the salaries of Members of a congressional chamber that has not agreed to a budget resolution for FY2022 by April 15, 2021. Salaries are withheld from April 16, 2021, until the chamber agrees to a budget resolution or the last day of the 117th Congress, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe bill eliminates automatic pay adjustments for Members of Congress.\n\nThe bill prohibits the use of funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the official travel of a Member of Congress or other officer or employee of the legislative branch for airline accommodations that are not coach-class accommodations. This prohibition shall not apply to an individual if the use would be permitted for an employee of an agency subject to specified federal regulations for temporary duty travel allowances."
