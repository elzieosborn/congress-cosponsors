This bill addresses immigration-related issues for victims of domestic violence and other crimes.

For example, the bill (1) extends the period of admission into the United States for certain spouses or children who derive their immigration status from an individual who is abusing the spouse or child; and (2) establishes a presumption that an individual with certain pending applications, such as for a visa for a victim of human trafficking or certain other crimes, should be released from immigration detention without conditions.</summary>
