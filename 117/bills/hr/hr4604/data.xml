  <summary date="2021-08-12T19:05:56Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill allows certain individuals with prior service in the District of Columbia government to contribute towards their annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Specifically, the bill allows certain individuals who were previously under the District's retirement system and were transferred to the CSRS and FERS in 1997 (e.g., certain employees of the District's criminal justice system) to contribute toward annuities stemming from their prior qualifying service.</summary>
