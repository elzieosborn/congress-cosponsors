After issuing such an order, the FDA may also order a recall after affording the producer an opportunity for an informal hearing.\n\nIf a drug presents an imminent threat of serious adverse health consequences or death, the FDA may order the producer to immediately recall the drug and notify affected individuals. The distributor may appeal such an order.\n\nAn individual or entity required to register as a producer of drugs or medical devices must have a recall plan in effect."
