This bill authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to order the recall of certain adulterated or misbranded drugs and contains other related provisions.

A producer of a medication must notify the FDA of the identity and location of a drug if the producer has reason to believe that (1) the drug is adulterated or misbranded, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that the drug will cause a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.

If use of a drug may cause serious adverse health consequences or death, the FDA may order the producer to immediately cease distribution and notify affected individuals. After issuing such an order, the FDA may also order a recall after affording the producer an opportunity for an informal hearing.

If a drug presents an imminent threat of serious adverse health consequences or death, the FDA may order the producer to immediately recall the drug and notify affected individuals. The distributor may appeal such an order.

An individual or entity required to register as a producer of drugs or medical devices must have a recall plan in effect.</summary>
