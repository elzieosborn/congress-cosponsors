This bill requires a community that participates in the National Flood Insurance Program and has been repeatedly flooded, as specified by the bill,&#160;to (1) assess the continuing risks to community areas repeatedly damaged by floods; and (2) develop and implement&#160;a publicly available, community-specific plan for mitigating continuing flood risks to such areas.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must, upon request, provide&#160;a community with appropriate data to assist in preparation of the required plan.

In making decisions with respect to awarding flood risk mitigation grants, FEMA may consider the extent to which a community&#160;has complied with these requirements and is working to remedy problems with repeatedly flooded areas.

A community that does not comply with these requirements may be subject to appropriate sanctions.</summary>
