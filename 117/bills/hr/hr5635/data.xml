This bill requires the President to establish an interagency working group to combat the theft of U.S. intellectual property and examine ways to use foreign policy to protect U.S. intellectual property.

The Department of State must, in consultation with the working group, report to Congress on issues related to the theft of U.S. intellectual property, including (1) any major foreign state-owned or state-influenced enterprises that have engaged in or benefited from such theft, and (2) authorities that Congress could provide to the President to combat such theft.</summary>
