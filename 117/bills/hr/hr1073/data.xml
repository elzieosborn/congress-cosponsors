This bill exempts from certain environmental or historic preservation review requirements a project that replaces or makes improvements to a communications facility&#160;following a governor-declared major disaster or emergency related to a wildfire.

Specifically, the bill exempts these projects from&#160;any requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. These projects are also exempt from considerations about the effect they will have on any historic property.</summary>
