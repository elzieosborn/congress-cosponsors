This bill requires certain actions if the President informs Congress about actions by China that result in (1) threats to Taiwan's security or social or economic system, and (2) any danger to U.S. interests. Specifically, after the President informs Congress, various federal agencies must take all necessary steps to exclude China's representatives from the activities of specified international organizations, including the Group of 20, the Financial Stability Board, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

The President may waive these requirements if doing so is in the national interest of the United States.</summary>
