  <summary date="2022-09-19T14:19:44Z" status="Introduced in House">Alaska Tourism Restoration Extension Act

This bill extends for one year the authority for specified foreign-owned and -flagged cruise ships to transport passengers directly between ports in the states of Washington and Alaska without stopping in Canada. Under current law, these ships cannot transport passengers from one U.S. port to another without stopping in a foreign country.

The bill applies to any foreign voyage that begins any date prior to February 28, 2023, on which Canada prohibits a vessel from berthing or docking in Canadian waters of the Pacific Coast due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</summary>
