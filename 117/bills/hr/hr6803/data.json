Under current law, these ships cannot transport passengers from one U.S. port to another without stopping in a foreign country.\n\nThe bill applies to any foreign voyage that begins any date prior to February 28, 2023, on which Canada prohibits a vessel from berthing or docking in Canadian waters of the Pacific Coast due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
