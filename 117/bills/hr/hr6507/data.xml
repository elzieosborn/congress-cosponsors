This bill allows for the establishment of child health savings accounts for the benefit of the minor children of a taxpayer. These accounts provide for a tax deduction for amounts paid in cash, up to $3,000 in a taxable year, by an individual taxpayer to such accounts.

The bill sets forth rules for the taxation of distributions from such accounts for children under and over the age of 18 years and allows for exceptions to such rules in the case of the disability or death of a child.</summary>
