It also requires Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance to cover prenatal services and one year of postpartum care without cost-sharing.\n\nThe bill also requires short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans, association health plans, and health care sharing ministries to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing. It also requires state Medicaid programs to provide coverage of COVID-19 testing for pregnant individuals who are uninsured.\n\nAdditionally, as a condition of Medicare participation, hospitals must permit pregnant individuals to be accompanied by someone of their choosing (in addition to a doula or other health care worker) during labor, delivery, and recovery, and may not implement any discriminatory policies that restrict hospital access or birthing options for pregnant individuals."
