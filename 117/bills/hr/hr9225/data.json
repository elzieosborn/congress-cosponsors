The process must (1) require U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to provide a substantive response to such an inquiry, and (2) include a procedure for the applicant to escalate the inquiry if no response is provided.\n\nDHS must also publish on its website and submit to Congress quarterly reports about the backlog. These reports shall include an annual report that contains information including (1) an analysis of factors contributing to the backlog, (2) a description of existing efforts to address the backlog, (3) state-by-state backlog data, and (4) approval and denial rates for each immigration benefit type.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall publish on its website and submit to Congress reports every two years assessing DHS efforts to address the backlog and to ensure fair and accurate adjudication of immigration benefit applications."
