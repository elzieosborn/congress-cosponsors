Under the existing program, DOE provides financial support for the production of advanced technology vehicles.\n\nThe bill expands the program to include financial support for (1) medium-duty passenger vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles that meet specified emission standards or emit zero-emissions; and (2) components, such as batteries, of ultra-efficient vehicles.\n\nThe bill also revises the emission standards that light-duty vehicles must meet to be eligible for assistance under the program.\n\n In addition, the bill revises requirements governing the evaluation of a loan applicant's prospects of repaying a loan under the program."
