  <summary date="2023-08-01T16:51:58Z" status="Passed House">This bill modifies Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) education and home loan programs.

The bill modifies the process for repaying service members and veterans who paid to keep benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill, but later chose to utilize Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Specifically, the bill removes the requirement for the VA to issue the repayments with the last monthly housing stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This requirement has limited the repayments to individuals who are receiving stipends. Under the bill, the VA must make such a repayment before the exhaustion of the individual's entitlement to education assistance.

Additionally, the bill extends from January 14, 2031, to January 28, 2031, higher rates for certain loan fees under the VA home loan program.</summary>
