This bill modifies the requirements for states receiving federal assistance for child welfare services.

Specifically, the bill expands the nondiscrimination requirements for state agencies involved in adoption or foster care placement. It also requires states to address disparities in access to services and extends the time line for modifying parental rights when a child is not in the care of a relative.</summary>
