  <summary date="2022-11-30T21:43:49Z" status="Introduced in House">No Surprises for COVID-19 Tests Act

This bill extends the temporary period during which private health insurance plans must cover testing and related services for COVID-19 without cost sharing. It also temporarily applies certain consumer protections against surprise billing to such testing and related services.

Finally, beginning on May 1, 2022, insurance plans without a negotiated price for COVID-19 testing services are no longer required to pay providers the published cash price for such services.</summary>
