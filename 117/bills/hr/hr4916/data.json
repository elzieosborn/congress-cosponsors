    "text": "Protect Moms From Domestic Violence Act\n\nThis bill establishes a grant program and requires studies to address adverse maternal health outcomes among victims of intimate partner violence, human trafficking, forced marriage, and similar harms.\n\nSpecifically, the Health Resources and Services Administration must award grants to state, tribal, or local governments, maternal care providers, institutions of higher education, and community organizations for improving maternal and child health outcomes for victims of such harms.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must study the relative risk of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity for victims of such harms. HHS must also contract with the National Academy of Medicine (or a similar entity) to conduct another study examining whether these harms increase the risk of suicide and substance use among pregnant and postpartum persons and other maternal health topics.\n\nThe bill also requires HHS to disseminate guidance on developing protocols and creating partnerships to address intimate partner violence and similar harms."
