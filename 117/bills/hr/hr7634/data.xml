This bill prohibits all federal health care programs, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and federally-funded state health care programs (e.g., Medicaid) from using prices that are based on quality-adjusted life years (i.e., measures that discount the value of a life based on disability) to determine relevant thresholds for coverage, reimbursements, or incentive programs.</summary>
