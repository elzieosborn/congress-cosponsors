    "text": "Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act\n\nThis bill requires the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to make grants to states for demonstration projects that provide wage subsidies to enable low-income individuals to enter and retain employment.\n\nStates may use grant funds to subsidize an individual's wages for up to 12 months. The subsidy may be up to 50% of an individual's wages. Individuals are eligible for subsidized wages if they (1) are recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or similar state assistance or a noncustodial parent of a child receiving such assistance, and (2) are unemployed when the subsidy begins or have an income below 200% of the poverty line.\n\nStates must ensure that participants in subsidized job programs do not displace current workers.\n\nThe ACF must reserve funding to carry out this bill from amounts in the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs."
