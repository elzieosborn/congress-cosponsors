  <summary date="2021-10-14T16:43:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Workforce Promotion and Access Act or the WPA Act

This bill requires the Department of Labor to establish a program to provide grants for job guarantee programs. Specifically, such grants are awarded on a competitive basis to political subdivisions of states, tribal entities, and outlying areas with a high unemployment rate to establish a program to ensure employment to residents. A job guarantee program qualifies under this bill if the jobs provided under the program pay a certain wage, are included in an established bargaining unit, provide health insurance, and comply with certain leave requirements.

The bill also imposes a trading excise tax, with certain exemptions, on certain transactions occurring on a qualified board or exchange in the United States or with respect to a derivative. The rate of such tax is 0.1% on purchases of stocks, bonds, and derivatives.

The tax applies to transactions by a controlled foreign corporation and must be paid by its U.S. shareholders.</summary>
