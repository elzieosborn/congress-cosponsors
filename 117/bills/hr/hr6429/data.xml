  <summary date="2022-03-07T20:34:06Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill addresses the COVID-19 vaccine for members of the Armed Forces and basic pay for members of the uniformed services. Specifically, the bill prohibits the use of federal funds to require a member of the Armed Forces to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The bill also prohibits adverse action (e.g., punishment) being taken against a member of the Armed Forces because the member refuses to receive a COVID-19 vaccination.

The bill also increases the rate of monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services by 2.7% starting on January 1, 2023. Uniformed services means members of the Armed Forces, the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service.</summary>
