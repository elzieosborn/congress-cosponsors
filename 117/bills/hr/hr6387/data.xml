This bill establishes in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a council to ensure the coordination of activities, plans, and policies to enhance the security of early childhood education programs and schools against acts of terrorism and other homeland security threats.

 DHS must participate in federal efforts to maintain and publicize a clearinghouse of resources available to early childhood education programs, elementary schools, and secondary schools to enhance security against such threats.

Further, DHS must report by January 30, 2023, and annually thereafter, to the congressional homeland security committees on (1) DHS activities, plans, and policies aimed at enhancing security; (2) the council's activities and contributions of DHS to federal efforts to maintain and publicize the clearinghouse; and (3) any metrics regarding the efficacy of such activities and contributions, and any engagement with stakeholders outside of the federal government.</summary>
