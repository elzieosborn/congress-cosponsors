This bill modifies various immigration-related provisions.

For example, the bill (1) increases to $25,000 (currently $1,500) the minimum amount of a security bond that the Department of Homeland Security may require before releasing a detained non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) from custody while a decision is pending as to whether to remove that non-U.S. national from the United States, and (2) imposes additional requirements before an individual may be considered an unaccompanied alien child (immigration law imposes various requirements relating to the treatment of unaccompanied alien children).</summary>
