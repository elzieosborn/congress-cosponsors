    "text": "This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to amend its regulations to revise the standards for the emission of ethylene oxide. Specifically, regulations must be revised based on results from the National Center for Environmental Assessment report titled Evaluation of the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide.\n\nThe bill also requires revisions to apply maximum achievable control technology requirements to chamber exhaust vents. Maximum achievable control technology standards are established for sources of hazardous air pollutants to limit or control emissions. Additionally, the revisions must apply to area sources and major sources of ethylene oxide.\n\nThe EPA must carry out a residual risk assessment with respect to the revised standards.\n\nFinally, the EPA must notify the public of violations under the revised standards, and failure to do so will result in an investigation to assess the health risks and prevent a future failure of notification."
