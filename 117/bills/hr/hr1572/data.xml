This bill directs the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to select three states to operate voucher pilot programs under which individuals who are eligible to vote may receive $25 vouchers&#160;toward contributions to the congressional candidates of their choice. Each participating state must (1) establish a commission or designate an existing entity to oversee and implement&#160;its pilot program, (2) carry out a public awareness campaign, and (3) submit reports to the FEC about the operation and effectiveness of its pilot program.

Upon receiving a preliminary report from a participating state, the FEC must reimburse&#160;the state for the costs of operating its pilot program.</summary>
