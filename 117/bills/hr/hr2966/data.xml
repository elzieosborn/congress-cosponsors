  <summary date="2021-08-26T18:59:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Military Spouses Employment Act

This bill expands the work opportunity tax credit to include the hiring of a qualified military spouse. (The credit permits employers who hire individuals who are members of a targeted group such as qualified veterans, ex-felons, or long-term unemployment recipients to claim a tax credit equal to a portion of the wages paid to those individuals.)

A qualified military spouse is any individual who is certified by the designated local agency as being (as of the hiring date) a spouse of a member of the Armed Forces who is serving on a period of extended active duty (in excess of 90 days or for an indefinite period) which includes the hiring date.</summary>
