(An aggravated felony conviction carries various immigration consequences, such as rendering the alien inadmissible, deportable, and barred from establishing good moral character for naturalization.)\n\nAn alien who is unlawfully present and who knowingly violates the prohibition against voting in a federal election shall be deportable."
