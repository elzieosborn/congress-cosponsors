This bill requires private health insurance plans to cover the diagnosis and treatment of craniofacial, oral, or maxillofacial congenital anomalies and birth defects. Coverage must include services and items that functionally improve, repair, or restore any body part that is medically necessary for normal bodily functions or appearance, as determined by the treating physician. Coverage limits and cost-sharing requirements for such services and items may not be more restrictive than those applicable to all medical and surgical benefits under the plan.</summary>
