The elective deferral is treated as made prior to the end of the plan's first plan year.\n\nAn elective deferral is an amount contributed to certain tax-exempt retirement plans (e.g., 401(k)s, 403(b)s, SIMPLE pension plans and IRAs) by an employer at the employee's election and which, except to the extent they are designated Roth IRA contributions, are excludable from the employee's gross income."
