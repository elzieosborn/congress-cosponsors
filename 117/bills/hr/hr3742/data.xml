  <summary date="2022-02-10T20:07:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Vaccine Information for Nursing Facility Operators Act or the Vaccine INFO Act

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to revise specified regulations that govern infection prevention and control programs in Medicare skilled nursing facilities and Medicaid nursing facilities to ensure that facilities provide their staff with specified information about certain immunizations.

For each immunization recommended for health care personnel by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, facilities must provide their staff with information about the benefits and potential side effects of each immunization.

Additional requirements apply based on whether or not a facility offers any of the recommended immunizations to its staff. Facilities that offer such immunizations must provide the information to staff before offering the immunization. Facilities that do not offer such immunizations must also provide information to staff about the availability and costs of the immunizations.</summary>
