Climate change mitigation bundle is defined as a group of conservation activities carried out together to achieve substantial progress toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing carbon sequestration and improving soil health.\n\nSpecifically, USDA must make state- or region-specific climate change mitigation bundles available to producers in all regions of the country to promote agricultural practices that increase carbon sequestration and reduce green gas emissions, including by making available bundles that are appropriate for cropland, pastureland, rangeland, and forestland."
