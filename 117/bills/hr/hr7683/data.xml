  <summary date="2022-06-07T16:06:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Artificial Intelligence Training for the Acquisition Workforce Act or the AI Training Act

This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish or otherwise provide an artificial intelligence (AI) training program for the acquisition workforce of executive agencies (e.g., those responsible for program management or logistics), with exceptions.

The purpose of the program is to ensure that the workforce has knowledge of the capabilities and risks associated with AI.

The OMB must (1) update the program at least every two years, and (2) ensure there is a way to understand and measure the participation of the workforce and to receive and consider feedback from program participants.</summary>
