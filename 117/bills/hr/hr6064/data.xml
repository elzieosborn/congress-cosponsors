Specifically, NASEM must review VA examinations that are provided for mental and physical conditions linked to military sexual trauma and are conducted to assess the impairments of individuals arising from such trauma.

NASEM must report on its review, and the VA must report on its plans to implement actions based on NASEM's findings and recommendations.</summary>
