The notice must be provided within 90 days after the state makes a placement decision.\n\nStates must establish procedures to (1) allow an individual\u00a0who receives such a notice to request documentation of the reasons for the decision involved, (2) allow the attorney for the child to petition the court involved to review the decision, and (3) require the court to commence a review after receiving a petition."
