This bill revises program requirements under the National School Lunch Program regarding food donations to allow schools participating in the program to donate food through a charitable organization official who is directly affiliated with the school food authority serving such school.

A charitable organization official may not receive donated food unless they have received a food safety certification, or other applicable certification, from the state health department or other responsible authority in the state such food is donated in.

The food donated by a school may be received, stored, and distributed on the campus of such school.</summary>
