This bill requires the SelectUSA program to solicit comments from state economic development organizations regarding federal efforts to increase foreign direct investment in semiconductor-related manufacturing and production.

SelectUSA is a Department of Commerce program established to coordinate federal efforts to attract and retain business investment in the United States.</summary>
