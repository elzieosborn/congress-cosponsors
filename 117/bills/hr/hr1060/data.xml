This bill limits the authority of, and places deadlines on, a state or local government over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities.

Specifically, the bill requires that the regulation of the placement, construction, or modification of a personal wireless service facility by any state or local government shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of the same service, including by providing exclusive or preferential use of facilities to a particular class of providers. However, a state or local government may establish reasonable and nondiscriminatory structural engineering standards, safety requirements, and aesthetic or concealment requirements for certain facilities.

Additionally, a state or local government must grant or deny a complete request for authorization to place, construct, or modify certain personal wireless service facilities within 90 days of receipt of the request or within 150 days of receipt of a request to take any other action relating to such facilities.

A state or local government is authorized to charge a reasonable, objective, cost-based fee for review of a request or for use of a right-of-way or a facility in a right-of-way owned or managed by the local authority.</summary>
