This bill limits the transaction or recommendation by registered investment advisers to specified investors of securities belonging to certain special purpose acquisition companies and brokers. Special purpose acquisition companies raise capital through initial public offerings with the intent to acquire other companies.

Specifically, these securities may not be recommended to a person who is not an accredited investor unless the related economic compensation is 5% or less or the company makes necessary disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the protection of investors. An accredited investor must satisfy certain requirements indicating their reduced exposure to financial risk, including those related to income, net worth, or knowledge and experience.</summary>
