  <summary date="2022-04-18T18:57:03Z" status="Public Law">Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act

This bill suspends normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. It also permanently authorizes the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions based on violations of human rights.

Specifically, the bill authorizes the President to proclaim increases in the rates of duty applicable to products of Russia or Belarus. This authority terminates on January 1, 2024.

The President may restore normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, subject to congressional disapproval.

The bill directs the U.S. Trade Representative to (1) condemn the recent aggression in Ukraine, (2) encourage other World Trade Organization (WTO) members to suspend trade concessions to Russia and Belarus, (3) consider steps to suspend Russia's participation in the WTO, and (4) seek to halt the accession process of Belarus.</summary>
