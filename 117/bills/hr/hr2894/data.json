Membership in the reserves is contingent on a mutual agreement between the agency and the individual. Reserves may consist of different components, with one component obligated to respond to a call to activation and the other not obligated to do so; each agency may establish penalties for those individuals who fail to respond when required.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office and each agency must evaluate and report on the reserves, including whether they should be made permanent."
