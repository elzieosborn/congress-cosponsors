This bill modifies the conditions for the termination of the oversight board for Puerto Rico.

Specifically, the oversight board must terminate not later than 90 days after certification by the board for at least two consecutive fiscal years that (1) the territorial government has developed its budgets in accordance with modified accrual accounting standards; and (2) the expenditures made by the territorial government during each fiscal year did not exceed its revenues, as determined in accordance with such standards and without regard to whether the applicable budget provides for the payment of debt service.

The bill also sets forth provisions regarding the transition of oversight from an oversight board to a territorial government.</summary>
