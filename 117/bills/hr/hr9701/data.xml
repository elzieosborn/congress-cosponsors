This bill directs the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to establish a program to convey certain federal land to individuals who permanently waive eligibility for certain welfare programs.

The BLM shall have final discretion as to the allocation of land to such individuals but must provide them with a means to express their preference for available land, including whether the land will be used for residential or agricultural purposes.

The bill prohibits the sale of the land for a 10-year period.</summary>
