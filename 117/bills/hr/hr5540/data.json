The standard must also require employers to make the data sheet available to employees exposed to the product and provide to employees versions of the sheet in languages other than English upon request.\n\nThe FDA must conduct (or award grants for) research into chemicals linked to adverse health effects and most commonly found in cosmetics that are (1) marketed to women and girls of color; or (2) used by professional nail, hair, and beauty salon workers. The FDA must also award grants to support research focused on designing safer cosmetic chemicals, such as those with no inherent toxicity.\n\nThe FDA must take actions to ensure that cosmetics marketed to women and girls of color are in full compliance with FDA requirements."
