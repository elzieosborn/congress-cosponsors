This bill imposes labeling requirements on cosmetics intended for professional use, requires research on health issues relating to cosmetics, and addresses related issues.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must require (1) the labeling for cosmetics intended for professional use to include the name of each ingredient in descending order of predominance; and (2) the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such a cosmetic to provide this information on its website.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration must issue a standard requiring each manufacturer or importer selling a cosmetic intended for professional use to (1) obtain or develop a safety data sheet for the cosmetic in various languages; and (2) make the data sheet available to relevant distributors and employers, such as hair salon owners. The standard must also require employers to make the data sheet available to employees exposed to the product and provide to employees versions of the sheet in languages other than English upon request.

The FDA must conduct (or award grants for) research into chemicals linked to adverse health effects and most commonly found in cosmetics that are (1) marketed to women and girls of color; or (2) used by professional nail, hair, and beauty salon workers. The FDA must also award grants to support research focused on designing safer cosmetic chemicals, such as those with no inherent toxicity.

The FDA must take actions to ensure that cosmetics marketed to women and girls of color are in full compliance with FDA requirements.</summary>
