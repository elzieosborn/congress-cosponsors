This bill establishes a program and provides additional leave to support mental health for federal wildland firefighters.

The Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior must carry out a mental health awareness and support program for federal wildland firefighters. Components of the program must include an awareness campaign, relevant education and training, a peer-to-peer mental health support network, and increased access to mental health benefits.

The bill also entitles each federal wildland firefighter to seven consecutive days of leave to be taken between June 1 and October 31 of each calendar year to maintain mental health. Leave not taken during that period expires.</summary>
