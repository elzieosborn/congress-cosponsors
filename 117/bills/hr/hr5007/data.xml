This bill requires health care providers to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of Medicare and Medicaid participation.

Specifically, participating providers must receive a COVID-19 vaccine by the date on which a vaccine is fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Providers who choose not to receive the vaccine due to medical necessity or religious beliefs must publicly disclose their vaccination status prior to furnishing services.</summary>
