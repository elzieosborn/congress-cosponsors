The amount of such credit is 30% of the cost of a home energy audit, not to exceed $150.\n\nThe bill defines home energy audit to mean an inspection and written report for a dwelling located in the United States that is owned and used by a taxpayer as the taxpayer's principal residence. The audit must identify the most significant and cost-effective energy efficiency improvements for such dwelling, including an estimate of the energy and cost savings for each improvement, and be conducted and prepared by a certified home energy auditor."
