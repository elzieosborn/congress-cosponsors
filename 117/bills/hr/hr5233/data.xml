  <summary date="2021-09-28T13:41:36Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands the tax credit for nonbusiness energy property to include a credit for home energy audits. The amount of such credit is 30% of the cost of a home energy audit, not to exceed $150.

The bill defines home energy audit to mean an inspection and written report for a dwelling located in the United States that is owned and used by a taxpayer as the taxpayer's principal residence. The audit must identify the most significant and cost-effective energy efficiency improvements for such dwelling, including an estimate of the energy and cost savings for each improvement, and be conducted and prepared by a certified home energy auditor.</summary>
