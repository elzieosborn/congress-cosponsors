This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take certain actions with the goal of countering cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center of DHS may disseminate protocols to counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including in circumstances in which such vulnerabilities exist because software or hardware is no longer supported by a vendor.

The Science and Technology Directorate may establish a competition to develop remedies for cybersecurity vulnerabilities.</summary>
