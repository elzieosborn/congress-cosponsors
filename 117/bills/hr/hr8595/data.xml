This bill addresses structures interfering with air commerce or national security near military installations.

Specifically, the bill requires

 the Department of Defense to elicit written testimony from the base commander of each military installation within a certain radius of a structure or sanitary landfill when making a determination of whether the construction, alteration, establishment, or expansion of such a facility will result in an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security; and any person that submits an application for an energy project near a military installation to disclose if they have a relationship with a foreign principal or an agent of a foreign principal.</summary>
