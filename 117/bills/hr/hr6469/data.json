To be eligible for a grant, a state or local government must certify that it\n\n does not have a law requiring a heighted standard for use of force and has taken steps to expand efforts to hire and retain law enforcement officers, and has not taken steps to eliminate drive-by shootings as a basis for first degree murder."
