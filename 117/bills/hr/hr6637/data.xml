  <summary date="2022-09-01T22:11:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Dignity for Immigrants while Guarding our Nation to Ignite and Deliver the American Dream Act or as the DIGNIDAD (Dignity) Act

This bill addresses immigration-related issues, such as requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to resume construction of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border and providing removal deferral for eligible non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law).

For example, the bill

 requires DHS to resume all barrier construction activities along the southern border that were underway or being planned prior to January 20, 2021; authorizes DHS to request National Guard support to secure the southern border; requires the hiring of additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel; provides funding for border infrastructure and equipment; provides statutory authority for the Flores settlement, which established policies pertaining to the treatment of minors without lawful immigration status by DHS; requires employers to verify the immigration status of individuals using an electronic employment eligibility confirmation system modeled after the E-Verify system; provides a path to permanent resident status to eligible individuals without lawful immigration status who entered the United States as minors (commonly referred to as Dreamers); establishes the Dignity Program, which defers the removal of eligible individuals without lawful immigration status who meet various requirements, including paying into a fund to provide training to U.S. workers; establishes the Redemption Program, which provides a path to permanent resident status to individuals who complete the Dignity Program and meet various requirements, including making additional payments into the U.S. worker fund; and requires the Department of State to implement a strategy to address the key factors contributing to individuals from Central America traveling to the United States.</summary>
