Under the bill, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. An employee has the option to substitute accrued paid vacation, personal, or sick leave for the unpaid FMLA time.\n\nThe bill requires an employee to make a reasonable effort to schedule treatments for when the treatment would not unduly disrupt the employer's activities.\n\nEligible employees may use this leave regardless of the employee's length of employment or the size of the employer."
