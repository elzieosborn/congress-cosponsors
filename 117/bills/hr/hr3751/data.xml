This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a grant program for increasing the resilience of publicly owned treatment works (e.g., systems used to treat wastewater or sewage) to natural hazards, such as extreme weather events. Under the program, the EPA must award grants to (1) a municipality; or (2) an intermunicipal, interstate, or state agency.</summary>
