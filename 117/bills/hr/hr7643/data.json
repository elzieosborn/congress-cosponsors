States may voluntarily participate in the program.\n\nThe program provides payments to states for damages from a natural disaster not covered by the National Flood Insurance Program for amounts in excess of trigger amounts. These trigger amounts are calculated by the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nStates must present a plan that ensures the coverage of losses by insurers not exceeding the trigger amount. States must also pledge to repay the full amount provided by the program within 10 years."
