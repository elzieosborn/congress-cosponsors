The CDC may award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to academic and other laboratories related to these activities.\n\nIn addition, the CDC must establish through public health agencies (or partnerships of such agencies) centers of excellence to promote innovation in pathogen genomics and molecular epidemiology."
