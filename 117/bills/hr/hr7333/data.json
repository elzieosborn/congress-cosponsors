    "text": "Communities Serving Schools Act of 2021\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Education to award four-year competitive grants to state and local educational agencies for implementing wraparound services in public elementary and secondary schools. Wraparound service refers to a school-based service that targets academic and non-academic barriers to student achievement, including assistance with academics and physical and mental health, provision of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, and clothing), and college and career preparation.\n\nA state educational agency that receives a grant must award subgrants to local educational agencies. A local educational agency that receives a grant or subgrant must use these funds for certain activities, such as hiring an on-site coordinator to ensure wraparound services are aligned with student needs and to connect students with those services."
