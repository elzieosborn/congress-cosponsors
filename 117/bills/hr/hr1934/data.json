(Such organizations, with the involvement of stakeholders such as equipment manufacturers, develop and set standards for certain technologies to ensure interoperability between different companies' products.)\n\nThe President must establish an interagency working group to work with allies and international partners to increase and align their engagement in standards-setting organizations, such as the International Telecommunication Union, that address standards and issues pertaining to communications networks, including 5G technology.\n\nThe Department of State must, in coordination with the working group, develop and implement a strategy to work with allies and partners and monitor efforts by China's government (and affiliated entities) to control or influence such organizations.\n\nThe working group must provide a briefing to Congress on (1) a strategy for diplomatic engagement with allies and partners to cooperate on addressing security risks in 5G and future generation mobile telecommunications systems, and (2) the presence and activities of China's government in international standards-setting organizations."
