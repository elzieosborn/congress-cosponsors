The CFPB must also identify in each proposed rulemaking the problem to be solved by the rule or regulation and the metrics the CFPB will use to measure the success of the rule or regulation. These metrics must include a measurement of changes regarding consumer access to, and the cost of, consumer financial products and services.\n\nAdditionally, the purpose of the CFPB is revised to include strengthening private sector participation in markets, without government interference or subsidies, to increase competition and enhance consumer choice."
