This bill authorizes long-term contracts for federal purchases of renewable energy and establishes related requirements. Specifically, the bill authorizes federal agencies to enter into contracts for the acquisition of energy generated from renewable energy sources or from cogeneration facilities for a period of up to 30 years.

In addition, the bill requires the Federal Energy Management Program to publish a standardized energy purchase agreement that an agency may use for such an acquisition.</summary>
