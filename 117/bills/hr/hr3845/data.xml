This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to authorize its Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to decide all appeals from formal protest determinations in connection with the status of a HUBZone small business.

A HUBZone small business is a small business in a historically underutilized business zone. Currently, HUBZone status appeals are the responsibility of the Office of Government Contracting and Business Development. The bill would place HUBZone status appeals within the purview of the OHA alongside other SBA programs such as the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business program and the Women-Owned Small Business program.</summary>
