This bill prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from granting licenses or access to U.S. markets for non-geostationary orbit satellite systems to certain producers or providers of communications equipment or services. Specifically, the FCC may not grant a license or market access to an entity that produces or provides equipment or a service that the FCC determines poses an unacceptable risk to national security or the security and safety of U.S. persons (e.g., Huawei Technologies Company and China Mobile International USA Inc.).

Non-geostationary satellite systems are comprised of satellites that do not maintain a stationary position but rather move in relation to the Earth's surface; they may be used to provide broadband and other telecommunications services.</summary>
