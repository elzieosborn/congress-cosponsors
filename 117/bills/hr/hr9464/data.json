Specifically, the FCC may not grant a license or market access to an entity that produces or provides equipment or a service that the FCC determines poses an unacceptable risk to national security or the security and safety of U.S. persons (e.g., Huawei Technologies Company and China Mobile International USA Inc.).\n\nNon-geostationary satellite systems are comprised of satellites that do not maintain a stationary position but rather move in relation to the Earth's surface; they may be used to provide broadband and other telecommunications services."
