This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to establish a demonstration project to evaluate the benefits of providing additional payments to providers of biosimilars under Medicare. Specifically, under the demonstration project, participating providers receive an additional payment based on the difference between the costs to the provider of furnishing the biosimilar and the cost if the provider had furnished the underlying reference biological product instead.</summary>
