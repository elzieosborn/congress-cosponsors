This bill prohibits the importation of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia. The President may waive this prohibition by meeting certain requirements, such as certifying to Congress that the import prohibition would unduly impact energy prices for U.S. consumers.

The bill also requires the President to impose sanctions on foreign individuals and entities that are involved with (1) importing crude oil and petroleum products from Russia to the United States, and (2) acts of corruption or serious human rights abuses.</summary>
