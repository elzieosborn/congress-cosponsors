It also provides a tax credit for a percentage of the basis of qualifying medical manufacturing EPA compliance property placed in service before January 1, 2029, or during calendar year 2030.\n\n The bill defines qualifying medical manufacturing EPA compliance property as depreciable property used by a taxpayer in the trade or business of manufacturing a drug, device, biological product, or active pharmaceutical ingredient or covered countermeasure (e.g., a qualified pandemic or epidemic product, security countermeasure, or respiratory protective device). The property must meet emissions limits under the Clean Air Act or wastewater standards under the Clean Water Act."
