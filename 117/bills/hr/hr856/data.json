It also requires disclosure of payments made to spouses or immediate family members.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits an authorized committee of a candidate or any other political committee that is established, maintained, or controlled by a candidate or an individual holding federal office from directly or indirectly compensating the spouse of the candidate or individual for services provided to or on behalf of the committee. The prohibition does not apply to a political committee of a political party.\n\nNext, the bill requires a political committee to report on disbursements to the spouse or an immediate family member of the candidate or the individual holding federal office.\n\nFinally, the bill requires any penalty for a violation of the bill to be imposed on the candidate or the individual holding federal office if the candidate or individual involved knew of the violation. Further, it prohibits the committee involved from reimbursing the candidate or individual for the penalty."
