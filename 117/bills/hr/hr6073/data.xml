  <summary date="2022-08-19T13:21:58Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving Chassis Capacity for Memphis' Supply Chain Act

This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to undertake a process, in coordination with the Federal Maritime Commission, to create a voluntary chassis pool operated by a private sector entity at the rail ramps near Memphis, TN. (Chassis are special trailers used to transport shipping containers.)

DOT must solicit proposals from private sector entities to develop a model for operating such a pool. The proposals must address, among other matters, a sustainable fee structure, estimates of the number of chassis needed in the pool, and real property necessary to operate the pool.

If any entities submit satisfactory proposals, DOT must (1) contract with one of those entities to operate the pool, and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the pool within one year of its implementation. In the event there are no satisfactory proposals submitted, DOT must provide Congress with alternative options to improve the availability of chassis at the rail ramps.</summary>
