CBP shall have immediate access to such federal lands to conduct various activities, including the installation and maintenance of roads, barriers, and surveillance equipment.\n\nFurthermore, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may waive the application of certain legal requirements on such federal lands if DHS determines that the waiver is necessary to ensure the expeditious construction of border barriers and roads. DHS may waive only specified laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Historic Preservation Act, and certain provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act."
