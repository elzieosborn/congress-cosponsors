It also limits when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may separate a child from a parent or legal guardian.\n\nThe bill establishes the independent DHS Border Oversight Commission. The commission's duties shall include recommending policies to protect civil rights and improve the safety of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.\n\nThe bill establishes the Office of the Ombudsman for Border and Immigration Related Concerns. The office shall independently receive and resolve complaints and requests for assistance regarding border security and immigration activities. The office shall have the power to provide redress, including immigration relief and monetary damages.\n\nThe bill establishes the Border Community Liaison Office. The office's duties include consulting with communities in sectors on the northern and southern borders\u00a0when developing policies and programs.\n\nDHS must ensure CBP officers receive continual education and training each year on topics including interaction with vulnerable populations and professional conduct standards.\n\nThe bill imposes data collection requirements on law enforcement officials conducting border and immigration-related stops and searches.\n\nA child may not be removed from a parent or legal guardian at or near a port of entry or within 100 miles of the border except in certain instances, such as when a court determines that removal of the child is in the child's best interests.\n\nThe bill requires various reports, including a Government Accountability Office report on the use of force by CBP and ICE."
