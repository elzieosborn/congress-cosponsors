This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take various actions to facilitate the search for and remediation of unlawful border crossing tunnels on private land.

Specifically, DHS may waive federal, state, or local environmental permits and reviews as necessary to search for or remediate such tunnels. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may enter into indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts with two or more sources to facilitate such border tunnel activities. (Indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of services for a fixed time.)</summary>
