This bill requires a social media company to remove a deceptive or fraudulent account or profile from its platform and to verify the creator of an account that is alleged to be deceptive or fraudulent.

Specifically, a social media company must establish a means whereby a user may request the investigation and removal of a deceptive account or profile. The social media company must expeditiously remove or disable access to a deceptive account or profile and any materials or messages published therefrom.

Further, a social media company must notify a user who submits such a request of any reasons underlying a determination that an account or profile is not deceptive, and it must take escalating actions against an individual who makes false or bad faith requests for the investigation and removal of an account or profile.</summary>
