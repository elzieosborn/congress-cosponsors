This bill requires state and local governments to certify that they provide a certain level of qualified immunity to law enforcement officers in order to be eligible for (1) funds under the Community Development Block Grant program, and (2) loans under the Department of Agriculture's Community Facilities Direct Loan and Grant Program.

 Qualified immunity is a judicially created legal doctrine that shields government officials from civil liability in cases involving the deprivation of statutory or constitutional rights.</summary>
