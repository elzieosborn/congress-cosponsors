  <summary date="2022-04-11T13:52:02Z" status="Passed House">Medical Marijuana Research Act

This bill establishes a new, separate registration process to facilitate medical marijuana research.

Specifically, it directs the Drug Enforcement Administration to register (1) practitioners to conduct medical marijuana research, and (2) manufacturers and distributors to supply marijuana for such research.

Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must continue to produce marijuana through the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program and implement a specialized process for supplying marijuana products available through state-authorized marijuana programs to researchers until manufacturers and distributors can provide a sufficient supply of marijuana for medical research.</summary>
