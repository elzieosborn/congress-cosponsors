This bill revises the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to allow households with individuals under 18 years of age who have chronic medical conditions to deduct certain medical expenses incurred by the individual from household income when calculating SNAP benefits. Currently, the excess medical expense deduction under SNAP allows households with an elderly or disabled individual to deduct such expenses.</summary>
