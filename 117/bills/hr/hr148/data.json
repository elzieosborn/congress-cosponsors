Currently, a similar tax credit exists for employers who hire certain disadvantaged individuals, including disadvantaged veterans.\n\nThe Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security (with respect to the Coast Guard) must implement flexible spending arrangements that permit members of the Armed Forces to use basic pay and compensation to pay on a pretax basis for dependent childcare."
