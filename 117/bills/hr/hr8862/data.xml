  <summary date="2022-11-03T20:22:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Providing Real Opportunities and Lifelong Investments For Everyone Act of 2022 or the PRO-LIFE Act of 2022

This bill establishes new, and modifies existing, programs related to maternal and child health, tax credits and other benefits for parents and caregivers, and support for childcare infrastructure.

The bill requires multi-agency efforts to improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality, particularly among racial and ethnic minority groups, veterans, and other vulnerable populations, by addressing both health-related factors and the social determinants of health (i.e., nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes, such as housing, food security, transportation, and environmental conditions). Additionally, the bill permanently extends the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and related measures.

Further, the bill (1) sets up a family medical leave insurance benefit that entitles employees to a monthly benefit payment for a period of qualified caregiving; and (2) imposes a tax on employers, employees, and self-employed individuals to fund the benefits. The bill also increases the amount of the child tax credit and makes the credit fully refundable and payable in advance on a monthly basis.

In addition, the Department of Labor must carry out a program to certify and recognize employers that implement family-friendly workplace programs (e.g., providing paid family and sick leave or subsidizing childcare).

The bill also requires support for childcare infrastructure, for example by establishing grants for childcare facilities and scholarship and loan repayment programs for childcare educators.</summary>
