It also allows an individual taxpayer (other than a nonresident alien) a refundable income tax credit equal to $1,000, subject to a phaseout if the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds a certain threshold amount. The dollar amounts in this bill are subject to a inflation adjustment in calendar years after 2023."
