This bill imposes an excise tax on coal mines or oil or gas wells equal to $50 per ton of carbon contained in fuel produced at such mines or wells located in the United States, or entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. It also allows an individual taxpayer (other than a nonresident alien) a refundable income tax credit equal to $1,000, subject to a phaseout if the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds a certain threshold amount. The dollar amounts in this bill are subject to a inflation adjustment in calendar years after 2023.</summary>
