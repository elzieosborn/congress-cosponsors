SDRs may be exchanged between member countries and may also be exchanged for currencies.\n\nTreasury must also (1) vigorously advocate for IMF member countries to prohibit transactions involving the exchange of SDRs held by Russia or Belarus, and (2) direct U.S. representatives to each international financial institution to oppose providing financial assistance to Russia or Belarus except to address the basic human needs of their civilian populations.\n\nThe act's provisions shall be in effect until the earlier of (1) five years after this act's enactment, or (2) 30 days after the President reports to Congress that the governments of Russia and Belarus have ceased destabilizing activities directed at Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The President may also waive the provisions upon reporting to Congress that doing so is in the national interest of the United States."
