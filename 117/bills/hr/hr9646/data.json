These visas shall be available in FY2023 and in subsequent fiscal years until they are used.\n\nFurthermore, the yearly cap on the number of employment-based immigration visas that are made available to a single country shall not apply to the visas made available under this bill. (Generally, individuals from a single country may only receive up to 7% of such visas made available in a fiscal year.)"
