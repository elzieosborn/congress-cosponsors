This bill increases the number of employment-based immigration visas available.

The total number of additional visas made available under this bill shall be based on a formula relating to certain types of visas issued from FY1992-FY2021. These visas shall be available in FY2023 and in subsequent fiscal years until they are used.

Furthermore, the yearly cap on the number of employment-based immigration visas that are made available to a single country shall not apply to the visas made available under this bill. (Generally, individuals from a single country may only receive up to 7% of such visas made available in a fiscal year.)</summary>
