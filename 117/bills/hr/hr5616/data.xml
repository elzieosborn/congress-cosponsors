  <summary date="2022-03-09T19:12:14Z" status="Passed House">DHS Basic Training Accreditation Improvement Act of 2021

This bill addresses issues involving accreditation and law enforcement training, research, and development at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Specifically, the bill requires DHS to report to the congressional homeland security committees on the accreditation status for each basic training program within DHS. If a basic training program loses accreditation, the relevant DHS component shall notify the department within 30 days after such loss.

The Under Secretary for Science and Technology must carry out research and development of systems and technologies to enhance access to training offered by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement, with particular attention to rural or remote communities, to enhance domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism and other homeland security threats.</summary>
