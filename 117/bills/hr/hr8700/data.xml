This bill phases out existing repayment plans for federal student loans and replaces them with one fixed repayment plan and one income-based repayment plan.

The Department of Education must offer all borrowers a choice between the two new plans and allow borrowers of loans made prior to July 1, 2023, the option of continuing repayment under their original plan or electing to repay under one of the new plans.

The bill also establishes a 1% interest rate on federal student loans made to borrowers on or after July 1, 2023.</summary>
