  <summary date="2022-03-09T20:32:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Finding Orphan-disease Remedies With Antifungal Research and Development Act of 2021 or the FORWARD Act of 2021

This bill establishes programs to support research on endemic fungal diseases and the development of antifungal drugs, with a particular focus on Valley Fever. Endemic fungal diseases are fungal infections that tend to occur in specific geographic areas and affect older adults and other at-risk populations.

Specifically, the bill establishes the Endemic Fungal Disease Working Group to review, coordinate, and make recommendations about the Department of Health and Human Services' efforts to address endemic fungal diseases. The working group is comprised of experts from both relevant federal agencies and the private sector.

In addition, the National Institutes of Health must continue its support for research on endemic fungal diseases.

Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration must issue guidance for entities seeking approval for therapies, diagnostics, and vaccines to prevent and treat Valley Fever. Additionally, the bill provides for the use of priority reviews and other fast-track procedures to incentivize and expedite development and approval of these medical products.

The bill also requires the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to implement the Combating Antimicrobial Resistance Biopharmaceutical Accelerator Program to reduce and prevent antimicrobial resistance.</summary>
