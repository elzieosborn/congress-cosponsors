The program must share best practices for food waste reduction with governmental entities, agriculture organizations, farmers, and other relevant entities, and must post research and resources on its website.\n\nThe bill also establishes a grant program for research centers and nonprofits to support other cooperative efforts relating to food loss and waste reduction."
