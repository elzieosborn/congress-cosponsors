This bill extends certain procedures currently available to emerging growth companies to all issuers of securities.

Specifically, the bill provides statutory authority for issuers of securities to communicate with potential investors to ascertain interest in a contemplated securities offering, either before or after the filing of a registration statement (i.e., test the waters).

The bill also allows&#160;issuers to submit a confidential draft registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for review prior to public filing or within one year after the&#160;initial public offering or registration.</summary>
