This bill permanently allows physical therapists to provide telehealth services under Medicare.

Currently, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services is authorized to waive requirements for Medicare telehealth services during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19, and it has done so to allow all providers that are otherwise eligible to furnish in-person services under Medicare to also furnish telehealth services.</summary>
