  <summary date="2023-09-11T16:34:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Generic Animal Drug Advancement Act

This bill allows for the approval and corresponding labeling of generic animal drugs that are bioequivalent to another approved drug with respect to at least one species, rather than with respect to all of the same species. (Animal drugs are drugs that are intended for animals other than humans (e.g., pets and livestock). Animal drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration before they may be offered on the commercial market.)</summary>
