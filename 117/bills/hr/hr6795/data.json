Currently, CBP is only required to make every effort to provide food and water.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office must carry out regular and unannounced inspections of CBP processes and share such information with Congress. CBP may not prevent Members of Congress or staff from accessing CBP facilities for oversight purposes, nor may CBP make temporary modifications to alter what a visiting Member of Congress may observe."
