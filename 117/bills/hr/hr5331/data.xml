This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide a certain payment adjustment under the Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) prospective payment system. Specifically, the CMS must provide for a three-year temporary add-on payment adjustment for new medical devices used to diagnose, treat, or manage ESRD. (CMS regulations currently provide a two-year temporary add-on payment adjustment.)</summary>
