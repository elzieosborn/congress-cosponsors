The Departments of Commerce and the Interior must, after accepting public comment, conduct annual reviews of every nation's compliance with any international fishery conservation program or international program for endangered or threatened species, and take specified actions.\n\nThe President must enlist all federal agencies to help fight the wildlife extinction crisis by directing each federal agency to take specified actions to prioritize the recovery of endangered species and to rebuild healthy wildlife and plant populations, including by fully integrating climate change concerns into the conservation and recovery of endangered species.\n\nThe President must direct the Department of Defense to prioritize the protection of endangered species and rare habitats on U.S. military installations around the world."
