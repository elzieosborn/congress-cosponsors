This bill establishes a program to distribute funds to cover the travel expenses of individuals who must travel out of state to obtain certain abortion services.

Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may award up to $1,000 to an individual who (1) is a resident of a state that does not have a state law protecting the right to abortion services before fetal viability, and (2) traveled to another state to receive abortion services. HHS may increase the award amount in extraordinary circumstances.</summary>
