This bill generally prohibits federal education funding for elementary or secondary schools, local or state educational agencies, or institutions of higher education (IHEs) that do not provide in-person instruction.

Specifically, the bill prohibits a school, educational agency, or IHE from receiving federal education funds unless the school, educational agency, or IHE (1) demonstrates to the Department of Education (ED) that it provides in-person instruction to students, and (2) certifies to ED that it will not discontinue in-person instruction for students due to COVID-19. This prohibition does not apply to a school, educational agency, or IHE that provides distance education or other virtual instruction to students in the regular course of its operations for reasons that are unrelated to COVID-19.</summary>
