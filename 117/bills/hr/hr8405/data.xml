This bill directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take steps to allow patients to receive prescriptions for mifepristone, a drug approved by the FDA for medical abortion, via telehealth and for prescriptions for the drug to be filled by mail.

(Mifepristone is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which imposes various safety-related requirements. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA suspended enforcement of the current strategy's requirement that the drug must be dispensed in person, and this suspension is still in effect. In December 2021, the FDA stated the data supported modifying the strategy to remove the in-person dispensing requirement.)

Under this bill, the FDA must require the holder of the relevant approved drug application to submit a proposal to modify the strategy. The modification shall (1) remove the in-person dispensing requirement, (2) allow patients to access prescriptions for mifepristone via telehealth, and (3) authorize all pharmacies certified to dispense mifepristone to patients to do so via mail.</summary>
