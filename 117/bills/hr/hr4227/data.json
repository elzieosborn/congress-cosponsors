Venture capital funds are exempt from certain regulations applicable to other investment firms, including those related to filings, audits, and restricted communications with investors. Under current law, non-qualifying investments\u2014which include secondary transactions and investments in other venture capital funds\u2014may comprise up to 20% of a venture capital fund.\n\nThe bill allows, after SEC approval, investments acquired through secondary transactions or investments in other venture capital funds to be considered as qualifying investments for venture capital funds. However, for a private fund to qualify as a venture capital fund, the fund's investments must predominately be acquired directly from a qualifying portfolio company."
