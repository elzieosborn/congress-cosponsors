This bill revises the regulatory treatment of private-placement brokers (brokers who receive transaction-based compensation for the sale of securities to preselected individuals or institutions) and finders (private-placement brokers who do not exceed a specified amount of compensation, transaction value, or number of transactions in a year).

Specifically, the bill (1) requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish registration requirements for&#160;private-placement brokers that are no more stringent&#160;than those imposed on crowdfunding portals, (2) allows for membership in any national securities association for private-placement brokers, (3) exempts private-placement brokers from broker regulations, and (4) otherwise modifies provisions related to private-placement brokers and finders.</summary>
