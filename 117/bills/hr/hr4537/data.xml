This bill revises state reporting requirements under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) program. It eliminates the option for states to use certain sampling methods in their reporting and requires states to report additional information related to the work eligibility status and participation in work activities for individuals participating in TANF programs.

The Department of Health and Human Services must also determine reporting requirements related to employment and earnings outcomes in consultation with the Department of Labor.</summary>
