This bill establishes and provides FY2022 funding for demonstration projects that provide education and training for health care occupations to low-income individuals with criminal records. The Department of Health and Human Services must consult with the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice on these projects.

Entities eligible to administer these projects include state, tribal, territorial, and local governments; institutions of higher education; specified health care providers; and other organizations with a demonstrated history of providing health professional training. As part of the projects, entities must provide legal assistance to project participants to address their criminal records and associated employment barriers.</summary>
