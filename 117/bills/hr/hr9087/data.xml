  <summary date="2023-08-15T19:31:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Transparency And Production of American Energy Act or the TAP American Energy Act

This bill modifies requirements related to the exploration and development of energy resources (e.g., oil, gas, and renewable energy projects). For example, it sets forth provisions to (1) resume sales of onshore and offshore oil and gas leases and restrict the President from imposing bans on or otherwise limiting energy leasing and mineral withdrawals without congressional approval, (2) set timeframes for and makes other changes to certain environmental requirements that apply to energy projects, and (3) address various aspects of permitting and regulating pipelines and energy infrastructure projects.</summary>
