This bill allows government officials to demand that persons and interactive computer service providers (e.g., social media companies) remove certain forms of their personal information from the internet.

Specifically, a federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local government official may make a demand in writing for the removal of the official's (or an immediate family member's) home address or home phone number that is publicly displayed online.

Within 48 hours of receiving a demand, a person displaying the address or phone number online must remove it and may not publicly display a removed address or phone number online during the 4-year period following receipt of the demand.

A provider must also remove within 48 hours of receiving a demand the address or phone number publicly displayed through its service.

Officials may sue a person or provider for failing to remove an applicable address or phone number. Courts may award to an aggrieved official injunctive relief, the greater of actual damages or $1,000, and reasonable costs and attorney's fees.</summary>
