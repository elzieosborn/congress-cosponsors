    "text": "Port Crane Security and Inspection Act of 2022\n\nThis bill limits the operation at U.S. ports of foreign cranes. Foreign cranes are those (1) manufactured by companies that are subject to the control or influence of a country designated as a foreign adversary, and (2) using software or other technology that connects to ports' cyber infrastructure.\n\nForeign cranes that are contracted for on or after the date of the bill's enactment may not operate at a U.S. port. The bill also prohibits, effective five years after the date of the bill's enactment, foreign cranes at U.S. ports if the cranes use software or other technology manufactured by a company affiliated with a foreign adversary and connect to a port's cyber infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) must (1) inspect foreign cranes before they are placed into operation for potential security vulnerabilities, and (2) assess the threat posed by security vulnerabilities on existing or newly constructed foreign cranes. CISA must also report to Congress about critical and high-risk security vulnerabilities posed by foreign cranes at U.S. ports."
