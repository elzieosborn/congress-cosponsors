This bill repeals provisions under the Stark law (i.e., the Physician Self-Referral Law) that (1) require rural providers and physician-owned hospitals to meet certain additional criteria in order to be excepted under the Stark law (e.g., restrictions on facility expansion), and (2) require physicians to provide certain notices to patients in conjunction with referrals for radiology services at group practices in order for such services to be considered excepted in-office ancillary services.</summary>
