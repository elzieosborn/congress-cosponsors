  <summary date="2022-05-17T15:49:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 

This bill temporarily waives certain requirements related to the President's authority to lend or lease defense articles if the defense articles are intended for Ukraine's government or the governments of other Eastern European countries affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

For FY2022 and FY2023, an agreement to lend or lease defense articles under this bill shall not be subject to certain requirements and provisions that typically apply to such lend-lease agreements, including a requirement that generally prohibits a loan or lease period from exceeding five years.

The President must establish expedited procedures to ensure the timely delivery of defense articles loaned or leased to Ukraine under this bill.</summary>
