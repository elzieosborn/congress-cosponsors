    "text": "Chance to Compete Act of 2022\n\nThis bill modifies examination requirements and other components of the federal hiring process for positions in the competitive service.\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides that a qualifying examination includes a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 review that is conducted by a subject matter expert. Additionally, beginning two years after the bill's enactment, the bill prohibits examinations from consisting solely of a self-assessment from an automated examination, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 review that is not conducted by a subject matter expert, or any other method of assessing an applicant's experience or education; an agency may waive these requirements when necessary but must report any such waivers.\n\nAgencies may use subject matter experts to develop position-specific technical assessments that allow applicants to demonstrate job-related skills, abilities, and knowledge; assessments may include structured interviews, work-related exercises, procedures to measure career-related qualifications and interests, or other similar assessments. The bill also allows agencies to establish talent teams to support and improve hiring practices.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must create online platforms through which agencies may share and customize technical assessments and share the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of qualifying applicants. The OPM must also create online platforms with information about (1) the types of assessments used and hiring outcomes, (2) educational requirements for certain positions and related justifications, and (3) authorities and programs that support agency recruitment and retention."
