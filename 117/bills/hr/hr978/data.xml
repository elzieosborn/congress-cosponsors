  <summary date="2021-03-26T13:35:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Chai Suthammanont Remembrance Act of 2021

This bill requires federal agencies to develop and disclose safety plans that contain certain information for on-site employees and contractors during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, the bill requires each agency to post a safety plan on its website that includes descriptions of (1) the personal protective equipment that the agency will provide to its on-site employees and contractors; (2) protections for employees whose work requires them to travel off-site; (3) testing, contact-tracing, and vaccination protocols; and (4) protocols that ensure the continuity of operations in the event it is necessary to reverse on-site requirements.

Each agency's Office of the Inspector General must report on whether the agency has published and implemented its safety plan.</summary>
