    "text": "Department of Defense Climate Resiliency and Readiness Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to address climate resiliency and energy and resource efficiency.\n\nEach DOD contract for the procurement of property or services entered into on or after October 1, 2021, must include specified information related to energy consumption and energy sources.\n\nWhen deciding whether to enter into a contract, DOD must consider whether the contractor verifiably produces as much renewable energy as the total energy it consumes and whether there is any order against the contractor for a violation of an environmental law or regulation.\n\nAmong other elements, the bill requires\n\n DOD to achieve aggregate net zero energy in use of energy by non-operational sources by December 31, 2031; DOD to give preference to contractors and small businesses that use green manufacturing technology; DOD to administer the Energy and Climate Resiliency Fund established by the bill; DOD and the military departments to consider climate change risks when making strategic decisions related to any military installation; DOD and other relevant federal agencies to incorporate climate change into the National Defense Strategy, the National Military Strategy, and DOD's operational plans; and DOD to conduct a program of research, development, and demonstration of hybrid microgrid systems and electric grid energy storage. The Government Accountability Office must report on the individual and aggregate uses of DOD's authority to give preference to contractors that use green manufacturing technology and small businesses that verifiably use green manufacturing technology or operate with net zero energy."
