  <summary date="2022-07-08T22:00:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Investing in Commonsense Ballistic Missiles Act of 2021 or the ICBM Act

This bill addresses the transfer and use of funds intended for defense programs. Specifically, the bill prohibits defense funds in FY2022-FY2031 from being obligated or expended for the ground-based strategic deterrent program or the W87-1 warhead modification program.

The Department of Defense (DOD) must transfer the unobligated balances intended for its ground-based strategic deterrent program to the Department of the Air Force.

DOD must carry out a life extension program of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles to extend the life of such missiles to 2040. DOD must ensure the program incorporates new and necessary technologies that could also be incorporated in the future ground-based strategic deterrent program. Additionally, the program must use nondestructive testing methods and technologies similar to those used by the Navy for Trident II D5 submarine launched ballistic missiles to reduce destructive testing.</summary>
