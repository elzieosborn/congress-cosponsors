  <summary date="2022-08-19T15:21:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution commends the bravery, courage, and resolve of the pro-democracy movement and all freedom activists in Cuba for risking everything to bring freedom to the Cuban people.

The resolution condemns the repression of the hundreds of pro-democracy activists and political prisoners, including children, that the Cuban regime is unjustly detaining and subjecting to physical and psychological torture, and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of such prisoners.

 The resolution calls for the international community to stand with the Cuban people and speak out against the totalitarian Communist regime in Cuba for infringing on the freedom of thought, will, expression, assembly, and prosperity of the Cuban people.

Finally, the resolution urges the President to firmly declare that the U.S. government will not consider any more concessions or sanctions relief to the brutal, illegitimate Communist regime in Cuba until all conditions for removing sanctions are met in accordance with the laws of the United States.</summary>
