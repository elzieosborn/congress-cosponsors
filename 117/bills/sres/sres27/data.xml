  <summary date="2021-02-19T16:50:12Z" status="Passed Senate">This resolution establishes certain procedures for the Senate during the 117th Congress.

Specifically, the resolution requires that the committees of the Senate, including joint committees and special committees, be equally composed of members of both parties. The budgets and office space for these committees must also be equal. These ratios shall remain in effect for the duration of the 117th Congress unless a party attains a majority of the whole number of Senators, at which time the ratios must be adjusted to reflect the ratio of the parties in the Senate.

Further, the resolution establishes procedures for discharging committees and subcommittees from further consideration of items that have not been reported due to a tie vote, and it prohibits a cloture motion from being filed on an amendable item of business during its first 12 hours of debate.</summary>
