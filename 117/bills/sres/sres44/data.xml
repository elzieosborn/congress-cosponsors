  <summary date="2021-04-05T21:52:58Z" status="Reported to Senate">This resolution denounces the Nicol&#225;s Maduro regime's most recent legislative elections as fraudulent and illegitimate, does not recognize the legitimacy of the new Venezuelan National Assembly, and joins members of the international community in rejecting the elections. Further, it urges that elections in Venezuela be conducted as soon as possible according to international standards for free, fair, and transparent electoral processes.

Additionally, the resolution calls on the Maduro regime to cease its persecution of Venezuala's independent political parties and release all political prisoners, and it calls for Nicol&#225;s Maduro and senior members of his regime to be held accountable for their actions.</summary>
