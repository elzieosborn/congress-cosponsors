  <summary date="2022-07-01T17:43:16Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that

 the establishment of a regional nuclear fuel bank should be part of a comprehensive plan for confronting nuclear nonproliferation in the Middle East; the United States should implement a policy that guarantees that any Middle East state that forgoes domestic uranium enrichment and reprocessing can purchase fuel for its commercial nuclear reactors from an international nuclear fuel bank; and the United States should seek bilateral and multilateral nuclear cooperation agreements with various Middle Eastern states, including Iran, that include a commitment by states to forgo domestic uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel.</summary>
