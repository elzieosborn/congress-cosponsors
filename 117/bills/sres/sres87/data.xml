  <summary date="2021-04-30T14:39:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution declares that mothers, especially mothers of color, have been pushed to the brink of economic, social, and emotional collapse during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic because of the existing economic and social inequalities that women have long faced.

 The resolution also states that any relief and long-term recovery package to address the COVID-19 crisis should recognize and rebuild moms in the workforce by including certain policies such as

 establishing a robust paid leave plan; rebuilding and stabilizing the child care industry; providing recurring child benefits&#8212;expanded and improved child tax credit and earned income tax credit&#8212;to help reduce child poverty and provide economic security for families; establishing an expanded unemployment insurance program that benefits struggling workers, including those experiencing long-term unemployment; and providing access to mental health support for mothers. Finally, the resolution declares that employers and policymakers must prioritize addressing the economic cliff facing mothers and make permanent the policies set forth in this resolution so that mothers are protected against any future economic calamities.</summary>
