  <summary date="2022-03-23T13:01:43Z" status="Passed Senate">This resolution condemns the repression of Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia and all brave Cuban activists, and demands their immediate and unconditional release from prison.

The resolution also condemns the brutal torture and inhumane treatment of Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia by the Cuban regime and calls for an immediate humanitarian medical visit by an independent human rights organization to him and to all political prisoners who have been unjustly and illegally detained by the Cuban regime since July 11, 2021.

Further, the resolution calls for the international community to stand with the Cuban people and against Cuba's totalitarian Communist regime for infringing on the freedom of thought, will, expression, assembly, and prosperity of the Cuban people.

Finally, the resolution commends the courage of the pro-democracy movement and all freedom activists in Cuba for risking everything to bring freedom to the Cuban people.</summary>
