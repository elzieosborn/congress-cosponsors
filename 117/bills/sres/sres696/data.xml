  <summary date="2022-08-24T16:10:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution recognizes that the United States has long sought to alleviate the suffering of civilians and nations hurt by war and remains committed to ensuring the long-term peace, prosperity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.

The resolution also recognizes that an effective Ukrainian reconstruction effort can only be accomplished by working in concert with other nations and international bodies.

Finally, the resolution encourages the U.S. government to lead an international group of allies that will equitably contribute to provide the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people with a reconstruction assistance package for the purpose of increasing ties between nations that are seeking a stable international order to counter malign and rogue actors.</summary>
