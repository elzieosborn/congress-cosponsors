  <summary date="2023-08-31T16:35:12Z" status="Reported to Senate">This resolution reiterates its strongest condemnation of the 1992 attack on the Israeli Embassy in Argentina and the 1994 attack on the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires.

The resolution also honors the victims of the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Argentina and the 1994 AMIA bombing, and expresses its sympathy to the relatives of the victims, who are still waiting for justice.

Finally, the resolution underscores the concern of the United States regarding the continuing, decades-long delay in resolving the 1992 and 1994 terrorist attacks in Argentina, and urges the President of the United States to offer technical assistance to the Argentinian government to support the ongoing investigations.</summary>
