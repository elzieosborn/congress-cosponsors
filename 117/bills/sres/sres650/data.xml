 condemns Vladimir Putin's illegal war in Ukraine, his repeated rejections of the existence of a Ukrainian people and a sovereign Ukrainian state, and his weaponization of hunger; calls upon Vladimir Putin and the Russian Armed Forces to immediately cease their attacks on Ukrainian civilians; calls attention to the impending global food crisis by observing May 28, 2022, as World Hunger Day; remembers the 90th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine (Holodomor) of 1932-1933 and extends its deepest sympathies to the victims, survivors, and families of this tragedy; condemns the systematic violations of human rights of the Ukrainian people by the Soviet Union; and supports the continuing efforts of the people of Ukraine to defend themselves against Russian aggression.</summary>
