  <summary date="2022-10-19T13:17:45Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution condemns the April 2021 military takeover in Chad as a coup d'etat.

The resolution supports the African Union's call for transitional authorities, including General Mahamat Deby and members of the Transitional Military Council (TMC), to (1) organize elections by October 22, 2022, in accordance with the 18-month timeframe articulated by the TMC, and (2) commit publicly not to stand as candidates in the elections they are responsible for organizing.

The resolution also calls on General Mahamat Deby and leaders of the TMC to (1) immediately release all of those arbitrarily arrested during the April-May 2021 protests, (2) publicly commit not to run in elections, and (3) abide by the 18-month transitional timeline for restoring civilian rule via free, fair, and peaceful democratic elections.</summary>
