Under the resolution, the center may provide enrollment to the child of a federal employee if\n\n there is an enrollment slot available; no child of an individual serving as an employee of the Senate, as an employee of the center, or as a congressional employee accepts the slot; and no currently enrolled child is ready to transition to the class in which the slot is available."
