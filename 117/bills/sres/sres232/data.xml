Specifically, the Senate

 condemns hatred and violence against Jews; denounces the anti-Israel rhetoric of elected officials; rejects as biased, incomplete, and inaccurate information promulgated by the news media in the United States about Israel and the Israeli government's efforts to protect its citizens from terrorism; celebrates the contributions of American Jews to our nation, culture, values, and way of life; and reaffirms its intent to ensure that Jews in the United States are treated with dignity and respect and receive the full protection of the law owed to them as U.S. citizens.</summary>
