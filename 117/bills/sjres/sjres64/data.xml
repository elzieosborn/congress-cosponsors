  <summary date="2023-08-07T23:20:38Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This joint resolution nullifies the final rule submitted by the Department of Homeland Security titled Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility and published on September 9, 2022.

The 2022 final rule nullified an August 14, 2019, final rule. The 2019 final rule made it more likely that a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) would be denied admission or lawful permanent resident status because that individual is likely to become a public charge (i.e., receive certain public benefits). This joint resolution restores into effect the nullified 2019 final rule.</summary>
