Expenditures for payment of debt and revenues derived from borrowing are excluded.\n\nCongress may authorize specific expenditures in excess of the limit for up to one year by declaring an emergency with a roll call vote of two-thirds of each chamber.\n\nThe requirements take effect in the first year beginning at least 90 days following ratification, except that expenditures are permitted to exceed the limit by specified amounts during each of the first nine years that the requirements are in effect."
