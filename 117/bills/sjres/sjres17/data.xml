  <summary date="2022-04-29T17:06:25Z" status="Reported to Senate">This joint resolution requires either the advice and consent of the Senate or an act of Congress before the President may suspend, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty. No funds may be used to support any efforts to suspend, denounce, or withdraw the United States from the treaty unless (1) both the House and the Senate pass a joint resolution approving withdrawal by a two-thirds vote, or (2) the funds are used pursuant to an act of Congress.

The President shall notify Congress in writing of any effort to suspend, denounce, or withdraw from the treaty at least 180 days before taking such action. The President must also consult with Congress before providing such written notification.

This joint resolution also authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel and the General Counsel of the House of Representatives to represent Congress in judicial proceedings related to actions that are inconsistent with this resolution.</summary>
