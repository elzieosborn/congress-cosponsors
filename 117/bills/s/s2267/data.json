The amount of such credit in a taxable year is equal to the product of $200, and the number of vehicles produced and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person in the United States.\n\nThe bill also repeals limitations on manufacturing incentives for dual fuel automobiles and repeals the maximum fuel economy increase for alternative fuel automobiles."
