This bill eliminates the requirement that cooperatives provide a personal guarantee with respect to certain Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. It also requires the SBA, in collaboration with the Interagency Working Group on Cooperative Development, to develop recommendations and cooperate with federal agencies and other entities to promote, support, and increase the number of cooperatives.</summary>
