A disqualified Chinese company is any corporation incorporated in China, or that invests more than 10% of its stock in certain Chinese entities, including entities controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury may grant organizations a waiver of the denial of the tax exemption under specified circumstances.\n\nOrganizations that hold any interest in a disqualified Chinese company must file annual reports describing each interest held in the company, the period during which such interest was held, and whether the organization has been granted a waiver."
