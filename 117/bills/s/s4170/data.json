    "text": "Mental Health Reform Reauthorization Act of 2022\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2027 various activities related to mental health services and resources.\n\nSpecifically, the bill reauthorizes a policy laboratory housed within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) that promotes evidence-based practices and service delivery models.\n\nAdditionally, the bill reauthorizes and modifies grants and similar assistance for\n\n treatment and other services for adults with serious mental illnesses and children with serious emotional disturbances, mental and behavioral health programs in the criminal justice system, priority mental health needs of regional and national significance, education and training for mental and behavioral health care providers, and integrated primary care and behavioral health care. The bill also addresses insurance coverage for mental and behavioral health. This includes (1) grants for assessing health insurance plans for compliance with requirements related to parity in the coverage of mental health, (2) applying the parity requirements to self-funded, nonfederal government health plans, and (3) requiring specified agencies to provide states with guidance about coverage recommendations for mental and behavioral health services. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must review claims data to assess the degree to which mental and behavioral health treatment aligns with evidence-based recommendations and standards of care.\n\nOther matters addressed by the bill include first episode psychosis activities (interventions to improve symptoms, reduce relapse episodes, and prevent deterioration and disability among individuals suffering from psychotic illness) and improving data collection and reporting of SAMHSA's activities."
