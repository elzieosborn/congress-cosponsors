This bill establishes a program to expand the mental health services workforce in schools.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education to contract with graduate institutions to pay a share of the cost of attendance for graduate students pursuing careers in the school-based mental health profession (e.g., school counseling).

Additionally, the bill requires an independent national evaluation of the outcomes and effectiveness of the program.</summary>
