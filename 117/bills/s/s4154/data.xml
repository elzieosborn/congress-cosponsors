This bill requires pooled employer retirement plans to designate a named fiduciary to collect contributions to the plan and implement written contribution collection procedures that are reasonable, diligent, and systematic. Current law requires a plan to designate one or more trustees to perform these tasks.

The bill also revises the requirements for combined annual reporting for a group of plans.</summary>
