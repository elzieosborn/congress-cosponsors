    "text": "Restaurant Relief Act\n\nThis bill provides support for restaurants and other businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and extends the moratorium on the implementation of a Department of Health and Human Services rule related to prescription drug pricing.\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides additional funding for the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide grants to support the ongoing operations of eligible restaurants and similar establishments. The SBA must report weekly and biweekly information about grant applications, awards, and denials.\n\nThe bill also establishes procedures for the SBA to implement and provide administrative support for these grant programs. The SBA must institute an oversight and audit plan to review the use of grants under these programs. The funds provided to the SBA by the bill are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.\n\nFinally, the bill extends until January 1, 2028, the moratorium on the implementation of the rule revising certain safe harbor protections for prescription drug discounts, drug pricing, and pharmacy benefit manager service fees."
