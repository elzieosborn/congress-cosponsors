These plans must increase the housing supply while avoiding resident displacement, increase housing affordability, and reduce barriers to housing development.\n\nThe amounts provided by the bill are designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) and the Senate PAYGO rule. (This excludes the budget effects from being counted for the purposes of enforcing the PAYGO rules.)"
