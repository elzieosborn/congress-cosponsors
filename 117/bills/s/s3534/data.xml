This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take specified actions related to the genomic sequencing of pathogens.

Specifically, the CDC must issue guidance on sharing specimens and other activities to support collaboration in the genomic sequencing of pathogens.

The CDC must also strengthen and expand activities related to the use of genomic sequencing of pathogens in public health surveillance, including by providing technical assistance to health departments. The CDC may award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to academic and other laboratories related to these activities.

In addition, the CDC must establish through public health agencies (or partnerships of such agencies) centers of excellence to promote innovation in pathogen genomics and molecular epidemiology.</summary>
