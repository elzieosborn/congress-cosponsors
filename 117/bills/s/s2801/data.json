The assessment must compare the rule's anticipated and actual benefits and costs.\n\nThe bill defines a\u00a0major rule\u00a0as a rule likely to cause (1)\u00a0an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, health, safety, the environment, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises."
