The program provides loan forgiveness for teachers who are highly qualified, teach full-time in a low-income school or educational service agency, and complete five years of consecutive service.\n\nSpecifically, the bill increases from $5,000 to $15,000 the amount of available loan forgiveness for an elementary or secondary school teacher in any subject.\n\nIt also increases from $17,500 to $30,000 the amount of available loan forgiveness for a secondary school math or science teacher and for a special education teacher."
