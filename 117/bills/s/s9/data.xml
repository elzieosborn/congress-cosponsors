This bill establishes a process to vacate convictions and expunge arrest records for certain criminal offenses committed by victims of human trafficking that directly result from or relate to having been a trafficking victim.

It defines the offenses eligible to be vacated or expunged and sets forth procedures for filing a motion.

The Government Accountability Office must assess the impact of this process, including the number of human trafficking survivors who file motions to vacate convictions or expunge records.

The bill permits certain grants for legal representation to be used to seek post-conviction relief.

Finally, the bill creates a rebuttable presumption that a defendant committed certain offenses under duress if the defendant establishes that he or she was a victim of human trafficking at the time of the offense.</summary>
