This bill makes temporary changes to the management of the inventory of diagnostic testing supplies and personal protective equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile.

Through FY2026, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must source a certain amount of those products from domestic manufacturers.

Additionally, HHS must periodically assess and take steps to manage the inventory of those products. This includes, as appropriate, transfers or sales to federal agencies and health care facilities.

The bill also provides HHS with additional authorities to manage the inventory. For example, HHS may enter into arrangements with manufacturers to establish revolving stockpiles to mitigate the risk of products expiring.

HHS must report on its efforts to maintain the stockpile's inventory of testing supplies and personal protective equipment.</summary>
