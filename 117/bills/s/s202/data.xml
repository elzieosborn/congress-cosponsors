This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system with emergency treatment at non-VA facilities during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. The VA may not require such veterans to seek authorization for such emergency treatment during this time. The bill also sets forth the payment rates and procedures for such emergency treatment.</summary>
