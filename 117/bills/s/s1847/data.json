States receiving these grants must (1) use funds to implement statewide policies, such as policies to support the expansion of education and career training programs for in-demand industry sectors or occupations, and (2) provide subgrants to community college partnerships to carry out program activities and student support services.\n\nFurther, ED must (1) contract with an independent third party to perform an evaluation of the grants awarded under the bill, (2) provide technical assistance, and (3) submit an annual report to Congress."
