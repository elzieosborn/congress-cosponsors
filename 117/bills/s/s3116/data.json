(This initiative was designed to prevent dating violence and encouraged youth ages 11\u201314 to have healthy relationships.) Finally, the U.S. Postal Service must issue a semipostal stamp (a stamp sold at a premium to raise funds for causes of national public interest) related to the Choose Respect campaign."
