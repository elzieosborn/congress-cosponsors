The President may waive this prohibition, on a case-by-case basis, if the President determines that the waiver is vital to U.S. national security interests.\n\nThe bill also places the Secretary of Agriculture on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and requires CFIUS to review certain transactions involving investments by foreign persons in the U.S. agricultural sector.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Agriculture must report on the risks that foreign purchases of U.S. businesses engaged in agriculture pose to the agricultural sector of the United States."
