    "text": "Guaranteeing Healthcare Access to Personnel Who Served Act\n\nThis bill addresses the administration and provision of health care to veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA providers.\n\nFirst, the bill provides statutory authority for the eligibility thresholds for when a veteran must receive non-VA care under the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) for primary care, mental health care, noninstitutional extended care services, specialty care, or specialty services. Additionally, the bill establishes access to care standards for non-VA care under the VCCP, meaning a veteran's appointment must be within specified distances and time frames.\n\nAmong other requirements, the VA must also\n\n implement an 18-month pilot program to allow certain veterans to use a website or mobile application to request, schedule, and confirm medical appointments with VCCP providers; ensure that VCCP third party administrators and credentials verification organizations comply with specified requirements to help ensure that certain health care providers are excluded from providing non-VA health care services; develop a strategic plan to ensure the effectiveness of the telehealth technologies and modalities delivered by the VA; and establish an online health care education portal for veterans. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report on (1) the VA program under which third parties provide transportation for veterans who are seeking VA services or benefits, (2) VA telehealth services, and (3) the VA's Foreign Medical Program.\n\nFinally, the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to the voluntary collection of information during research conducted by the Veterans Health Administration."
