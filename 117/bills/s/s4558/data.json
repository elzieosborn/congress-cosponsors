Emissions to be addressed include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapor, black carbon, and sulfate aerosols.\n\nThe goals and objectives of the initiative shall include (1) ensuring U.S. leadership in research and technology innovation leading to substantial reductions in aviation noise and emissions; (2) reducing greenhouse gas emissions from new and replacement aircraft to the extent necessary to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. aviation by 2050; and (3) noise levels from aircraft throughout all phases of flight that do not exceed ambient noise levels in the absence of flight operations in the vicinity of the flight route."
