This bill revises eligibility criteria and other aspects of a program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that supports a network of centers for public health preparedness.

Specifically, the bill makes nonprofits and institutions of higher education other than schools of public health eligible to participate in the program, whereas current participation is generally limited to accredited schools of public health. Further, the bill shifts the program's focus from curricula development and training public health practitioners to other areas, such as (1) researching and disseminating evidence-based practices to inform preparedness and response activities, and (2) providing technical assistance and expertise to health departments during public health emergencies.

The bill also repeals a demonstration program for improving the detection of pathogens likely to be used in bioterrorism attacks.</summary>
