Such supplies from the stockpile\u00a0are used to respond to public health emergencies.\n\nSpecifically, if HHS distributes pandemic or epidemic products (e.g., drugs or medical devices) to states or other entities, HHS must also deploy such products directly to health programs or facilities operated by IHS or other tribal entities.\n\nHHS must coordinate with states, programs, and facilities to ensure supplies and products are distributed to such tribal entities."
