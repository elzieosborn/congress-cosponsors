This bill requires the President to immediately approve a request from a state, territory, or Indian tribe affected by a major disaster for financial assistance available through the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP).

Under current law, such states, territories, and tribes must apply to, and wait for approval from, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to implement the CCP. This bill provides for automatic approval for such requests if the requesting state, territory, or tribe has been designated a disaster area under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.</summary>
