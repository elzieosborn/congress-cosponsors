This bill establishes cybersecurity employment and training programs through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Specifically, DHS must establish an apprenticeship program that leads directly to employment in cybersecurity in federal agencies. Program participants must agree to a period of obligated service with a federal agency after completing the program.

 DHS must also coordinate with the VA to establish a pilot program to provide cybersecurity training for veterans, individuals approaching veteran status, and military spouses.

The bill also extends through 2025 the requirement that federal agencies annually report critical cybersecurity workforce needs to the Office of Personnel Management.</summary>
