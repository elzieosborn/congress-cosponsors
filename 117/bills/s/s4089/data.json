The period for which retraining assistance is not charged must be equal to the full amount of retraining assistance provided for enrollment in the program of education.\n\nIn the event of a closure or disapproval, the educational institution must not receive any further payments under the program, and any payment already made must be considered an overpayment and constitute a liability of the institution to the United States."
