  <summary date="2021-12-09T15:15:57Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill authorizes a federal judge, prosecutor, or law enforcement officer to list a post office box instead of a home address for any federal, state, or other governmental purpose if there is a risk that the address may be made public.

The bill provides funding for the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security to implement this authority, including by developing programs to detect when the personal protected information of a federal judge, prosecutor, or law enforcement officer has been made public and remove it from the public domain.</summary>
