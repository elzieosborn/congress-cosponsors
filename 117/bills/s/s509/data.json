These public-private partnerships must foster the use of technology platforms by providers and payors of health care and social services to improve cross-sector coordination. This includes developing funding models to make the platforms financially self-sufficient.\n\nHHS must consult with stakeholders to develop data standards and guidelines for these grants, and the Government Accountability Office must evaluate the impact of the grants."
