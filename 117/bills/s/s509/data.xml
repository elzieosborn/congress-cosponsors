This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to better integrate health care and social services using technology platforms and related infrastructure.

To receive a grant, a state or territory must enter into a partnership with nonprofits and similar organizations or tribal nations. These public-private partnerships must foster the use of technology platforms by providers and payors of health care and social services to improve cross-sector coordination. This includes developing funding models to make the platforms financially self-sufficient.

HHS must consult with stakeholders to develop data standards and guidelines for these grants, and the Government Accountability Office must evaluate the impact of the grants.</summary>
