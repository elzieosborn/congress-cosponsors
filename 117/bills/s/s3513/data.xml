This bill imposes sanctions pertaining to Russia and addresses related issues.

The President must impose property-blocking sanctions with respect to Nord Stream 2 AG, the entity that operates the Nord Stream 2 pipeline designed to carry natural gas exports from Russia to Germany.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence must periodically report to Congress an assessment of whether Russia's government (or any foreign person acting on its behalf) has engaged in acts infringing on Ukraine's territorial integrity. If such an act has occurred, the President must impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions on certain foreign persons, including (1) any person operating in certain sectors of Russia's economy, including energy and finance; and (2) the President of Russia and other senior Russian government leaders.

If such sanctions are imposed, the Department of the Treasury must report to Congress on efforts to ensure that Russia's central bank and persons subject to the sanctions have been blocked from the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) financial messaging system. After this report, the President may impose sanctions on any financial communications services provider that has not blocked Russia's central bank and persons sanctioned under this bill from its service.

 Treasury must prohibit transactions by a U.S. person in the debt of Russia's government issued on or after this bill's enactment.

The President may terminate sanctions imposed under this bill if Russia withdraws its military forces from Ukraine and makes credible commitments to not engage in such hostile actions in the future.</summary>
