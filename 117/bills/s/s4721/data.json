The HISA grant program provides medically necessary improvements and structural alterations to veterans' (or service members') primary residence for specified purposes (e.g., allowing for entrance to their home).\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to increase the dollar amount of the grant in accordance with inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index."
