This bill increases the maximum amount authorized under the Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) grant program to $10,000 for veterans with a service-connected disability and $5,000 for those with disabilities that are not service-connected. The HISA grant program provides medically necessary improvements and structural alterations to veterans' (or service members') primary residence for specified purposes (e.g., allowing for entrance to their home).

The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to increase the dollar amount of the grant in accordance with inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index.</summary>
