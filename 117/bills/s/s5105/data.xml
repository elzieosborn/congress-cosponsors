This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to develop and support implementation of an evidence-based, K-12 curriculum on the dangers of substances of misuse, including opioids and vaping. ED must review and update the curriculum every two years.

ED must award grants to state educational agencies to implement the evidence-based curriculum. In awarding these grants, ED must give priority to those states that have experienced the highest drug overdose death rate per capita.</summary>
