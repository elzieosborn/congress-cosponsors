  <summary date="2022-03-16T14:12:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">United States Enrichment Corporation Fund Termination and Transfer Act

This bill terminates the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) Fund and rescinds all amounts currently in the fund. The fund was established to assist the USEC, a government corporation, with providing uranium enrichment services for the federal government and utilities that operate nuclear power plants. USEC was privatized in 1998, thus eliminating the need for the fund.</summary>
