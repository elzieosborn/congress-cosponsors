  <summary date="2022-09-28T13:23:54Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Protection from Abusive Passengers Act 

This bill addresses the banning of abusive passengers from commercial aircraft flights. Abusive passenger is defined as any individual who engages in behavior that results in a civil penalty or conviction for assaulting, threatening, or intimidating a crew member or passenger on an aircraft flight, or who takes any action to interfere with security screening personnel or any security system related to civil aviation security.

It requires the Federal Aviation Administration or the Attorney General to provide the identity, including the full name and date of birth, and gender of all abusive passengers to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

The TSA must maintain a list of abusive passengers and develop and make publicly available policies and procedures for handling individuals included on the list. Any individual on the list shall be prohibited from boarding any commercial aircraft flight until the individual is removed from such list.

Additionally, all abusive passengers shall be permanently ineligible to participate in the TSA PreCheck or the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Global Entry programs, with specified exceptions.</summary>
