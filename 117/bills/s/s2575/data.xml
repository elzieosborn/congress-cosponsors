This bill makes various changes to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), with a particular focus on returning individuals who receive SSDI to employment. Among other changes, the bill limits the amount of time an individual with a disability for which medical improvement is likely or expected may receive SSDI benefits, and it requires the Social Security Administration to establish a process to allow such individuals who return to employment before their benefits expire and whose earnings exceed a specified limit to receive an adjusted SSDI benefit.</summary>
