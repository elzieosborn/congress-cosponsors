This bill prohibits an employer from terminating or altering the employer-provided health insurance coverage of an employee during the period that the employer is taking action to lock out, suspend, or otherwise withhold employment from the employee in order to influence the position of such employee or the representative of such employee in collective bargaining prior to a strike.

An employer that violates this prohibition is generally subject to a maximum civil penalty of $75,000 for each violation.</summary>
