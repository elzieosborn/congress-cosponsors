This bill requires the President to take steps to sanction entities involved in the purchase of crude oil produced in Russia and to increase the production and refining of crude oil in the United States.

Specifically, the bill requires the President to block the U.S. property of (1) any foreign person who knowingly purchased Russian crude oil; or (2) any foreign financial institutions, insurance companies, brokering services, international trading houses, port operators, or shipping companies that facilitated any significant financial transaction for the purchase of Russian crude oil. The bill also directs the President to establish a task force to combat evasion of these sanctions.</summary>
