A school must forfeit or return these funds if it does not offer in-person instruction by that date.\n\nAdditionally, the bill outlines the use of forfeited and returned funds. A state may regain eligibility for these funds if it submits an implementation plan to ED that provides students with school choice options. If a state does not submit an implementation plan, then the funds must be provided as grants to states with the highest percentage of schools offering in-person instruction."
