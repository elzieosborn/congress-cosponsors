  <summary date="2023-11-29T20:26:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Retaining Access and Restoring Exclusivity Act or the RARE Act

This bill specifies that the seven-year market exclusivity period for drugs for rare diseases or conditions (i.e., orphan drug exclusivity period) prohibits the approval of the same drug for the same approved use or indication with respect to the disease or condition.

Current law grants a seven-year period of market exclusivity for an approved orphan drug, during which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may not approve an application from another manufacturer for the same drug for the same disease or condition. The FDA's regulations provide that this exclusivity is specific to the same approved use or indication of the drug, rather than all uses or indications, for the disease or condition. However, in Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Becerra, a court held that exclusivity did extend to all uses or indications for the disease or condition.

The bill provides statutory authority for the FDA's regulations.</summary>
