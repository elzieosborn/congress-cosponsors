The Department of Justice must issue uniform standards regarding the minimum number and distribution of such systems, workers, and other resources.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a chief state election administration official from taking an active part in political management or in a political campaign with respect to any federal election over which the official has supervisory authority, with certain exceptions."
