For example, the bill (1) makes each IHE participating in the Federal Direct Loan Program liable for 50% of&#160;any student loan balance that is in default and was used toward the cost of attendance at the IHE, and (2) expands the instances in which student loans may be discharged in bankruptcy.</summary>
