This bill requires certain federal procurement contracts for personal protective equipment (PPE) to be long-term (at least two&#160;years in duration)&#160;and for domestically manufactured PPE, with certain exceptions such as for nonavailability. The bill also addresses related issues, such as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to transfer excess PPE or medically necessary equipment to the Department of Health and Human Services during public health emergencies.</summary>
