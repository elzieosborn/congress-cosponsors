This bill expands eligibility for the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program, which provides emergency assistance for eligible venues affected by COVID-19, to include service and support companies. Such companies are those whose principal business (1) provides stages, lighting, sound, casts, or other support for live performing arts events; or (2) showcases performers or prepackaged productions to potential buyers.

In addition, the bill rescinds specified funds that were made available for COVID-19 relief and appropriates an equal amount to make grants to service and support companies.</summary>
