A covered state is each state (including Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and any territory or possession of the United States) that has a ratio of one or fewer Vet Centers per 100,000 or more veterans residing in the state or territory. Vet Centers are community-based counseling centers that provide social and psychological services to eligible veterans, active duty service members, and their families.\n\nThe VA must also report on the marketing and outreach funding of Vet Centers in covered states."
