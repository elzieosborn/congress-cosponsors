    "text": "Economic and Commercial Opportunities and Networks Act of 2022 or the ECON Act\n\nThis bill addresses economic issues in foreign relations and intellectual property (IP) infringement.\n\nThe bill expands the criminal offense of trade secrets theft to include the unauthorized modifying or developing of a product in a way that would not be possible without another party's trade secret. This offense shall apply to non-U.S. conduct if the offender attempts to import the product into the United States.\n\nFurthermore, the President may impose sanctions against a foreign person (individual or entity) that has committed a significant theft of IP belonging to a U.S. person. The President must also establish or designate a multiagency committee to (1) review petitions alleging such acts of IP theft, and (2) recommend whether to impose sanctions for the alleged theft.\n\nThe bill also prohibits foreign state-owned entities in international commerce from engaging in predatory pricing, defined in the bill as setting prices for a good below the average variable cost in a manner that may foreseeably harm competition. An injured party may sue in federal court. In deciding such cases, the court may consider the economic support and government subsidies provided by the entity's foreign state owner.\n\nFurthermore, the Department of State must establish a pilot program to create economic defense response teams to provide targeted support for countries facing an urgent or specific coercive economic threat from a U.S. adversary. The State Department must establish another pilot program to assist developing partner countries with identifying trade barriers and facilitating trade."
