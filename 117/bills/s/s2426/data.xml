  <summary date="2022-08-09T18:04:43Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fund the Police Act of 2021

The bill rescinds specified COVID-19 relief funds and makes the funding available to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for law enforcement grant programs.

Specifically, the bill rescinds certain unobligated funds that were provided by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 for making payments to states, territories, and tribal governments to mitigate the fiscal effects stemming from the COVID-19 public health emergency.

The bill makes the rescinded funds available to DOJ for (1) the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, and the (2) Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program. It also makes a portion of the funds available to establish a Law Enforcement Assistance Trust Fund to ensure the long-term availability of federal support for state and local law enforcement activities.</summary>
