Under current law, the transfer of digital assets from a broker to a nonbroker requires the broker to file a return beginning on January 1, 2024. The bill provides that a broker does not include any person solely engaged in the business of (1) validating distributed ledger transactions, or (2) selling hardware or software for which the sole function is to permit access to digital assets on a distributed ledger."
