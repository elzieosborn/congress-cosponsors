This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to enter into an agreement with a federally funded research and development center to provide a cybersecurity assessment of at least 3, but no more than 10, high-impact VA information systems and the effectiveness of the VA's information security program and information security management system.

The VA must submit a plan to Congress to address the findings of the assessment.

The Government Accountability Office must review the assessment and the VA's response to the assessment and report its findings to Congress.</summary>
