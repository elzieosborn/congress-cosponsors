This bill addresses housing and homeownership for Native American veterans.

Specifically, the bill revises the Native American Direct Loan program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to (1) allow Native American veterans to refinance existing mortgage loans; and (2) award grants to local service providers for conducting outreach, homebuyer education, housing counseling, risk mitigation, and other technical assistance to assist Native American veterans seeking to qualify for mortgage financing.

Additionally, the bill directs the VA to carry out a pilot program to address the feasibility and advisability of making direct housing loans to Native community development financial institutions for relending loan amounts to qualified veterans.</summary>
