Furthermore, an eligible child who was separated as a minor remains eligible for the immigration benefits after reaching majority.\n\nDHS must grant humanitarian parole into the United States to an eligible alien who requests such parole, regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United States.\n\nAn eligible alien in the United States may apply for lawful permanent resident status. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shall grant a qualifying alien's lawful permanent resident status within 30 days of receiving the alien's application.\n\nAn alien who receives lawful permanent resident status under this bill shall be eligible for benefits and services that are available to an alien who is admitted as a refugee.\n\nCertain annual numerical limitations shall not apply to aliens who receive lawful permanent resident status under this bill.\n\nIf an alien seeks judicial review of a denial of an application for lawful permanent resident status under this bill, the Department of Justice shall appoint counsel to represent that alien upon request."
