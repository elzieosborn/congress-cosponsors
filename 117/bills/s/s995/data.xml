This bill revises the requirements for third-party access to the central database for student aid (i.e., the National Student Loan Data System).

First, the bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to issue, by July 1, 2021, its guidance on the use of access devices.

Additionally, the bill provides ED with discretion to approve applications from authorized persons or entities for third-party data access to the system.

The bill also expands the categories of persons or entities that are authorized to access the system to include certain for-profit organizations.</summary>
