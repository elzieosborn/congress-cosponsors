This bill establishes several loan programs to assist households with paying utility bills for drinking water, wastewater, stormwater management, energy (e.g., electricity, natural gas, or propane), and internet services during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Under the programs, the utilities may apply for loans that are equal to the amount of the payment shortfall from their customers during the emergency.</summary>
