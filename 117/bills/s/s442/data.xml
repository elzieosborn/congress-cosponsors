  <summary date="2023-01-03T20:09:51Z" status="Public Law">Bulb Replacement Improving Government with High-efficiency Technology Act or the BRIGHT Act

This act expands requirements relating to the procurement and use of energy-efficient lighting in federal buildings.

Under current law, public buildings that are constructed or managed by the General Services Administration (GSA) must be equipped with energy-efficient light bulbs and fixtures. Under the act, buildings must be equipped with the most life-cycle cost effective and energy-efficient lighting systems available, including with respect to sensors, fixture distribution, and other elements. The act also specifically establishes requirements relating to the procurement of such lighting systems and modifies other requirements accordingly.

The act also requires the GSA to provide information to federal, state, local, and tribal entities about procuring and using such lighting systems in furtherance of governmental efficiency.</summary>
