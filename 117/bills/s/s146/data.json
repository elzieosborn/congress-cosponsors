Specifically, a medically distressed debtor may exempt up to $250,000 of the debtor's interest in (1) specified real or personal property that the debtor or debtor's dependent uses as a residence, or (2) a burial plot for the debtor or debtor's dependent.\n\nThe bill also waives certain administrative and procedural requirements for a medically distressed debtor.\n\n Additionally, the bill allows a medically distressed debtor to discharge in bankruptcy debts for certain education loans.\n\nA debtor who seeks relief as a medically distressed debtor must attest in writing that the debtor's medical expenses are genuine and were not incurred to bring the debtor within the meaning of a medically distressed debtor under this bill."
