Under the 7(a) Program, the SBA provides business loans and loan guarantees to small business borrowers who cannot obtain credit elsewhere on reasonable terms and conditions.\n\nSpecifically, the SBA must ensure that these lending institutions and other entities (1) provide an independent audit that examines adherence to all applicable federal laws and regulations regarding anti-money laundering, counterterrorist financing, sanctions, and financial crimes; and (2) implement a compliance program that is designed to conform with relevant anti-money laundering laws and regulations."
