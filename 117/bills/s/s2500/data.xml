This bill requires interactive computer services (e.g., social media companies) to issue a public disclosure containing specified information related to a request or recommendation by a government entity that the service moderate content on its platform. Examples of such moderation include eliminating the ability of a user to comment upon information or terminating or limiting a user's account.

Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in a fine of $50,000 per day, which shall be deposited in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. The Federal Communications Commission must submit an annual report that includes the contents of each such public disclosure.</summary>
