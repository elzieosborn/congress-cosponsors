  <summary date="2022-03-16T13:14:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Equal Enforcement of Cocaine Laws Act

This bill eliminates the federal sentencing disparity between drug offenses involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine.

Currently, different threshold quantities of crack cocaine and powder cocaine (e.g., 28 grams of crack cocaine and 500 grams of powder cocaine) trigger the same statutory criminal penalties.

Under the bill, the same threshold quantity of crack cocaine and powder cocaine (e.g., 28 grams) triggers the same statutory criminal penalties.

The change applies to future cases and cases pending on the date of enactment. However, the change does not apply retroactively.</summary>
