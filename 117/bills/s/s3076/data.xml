This bill imposes investment restrictions on certain Federal Reserve employees.

Specifically, members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and presidents or vice presidents of a Federal Reserve bank are prohibited from (1) purchasing or selling a specified investment, including an investment in a security, a commodity, virtual currency, or a future; or (2) entering into a transaction that creates a net short position in a security. (A short position is an investment strategy employed when an investor anticipates a short term decrease in the investment's price.) Investments held prior to taking office may not be bought or sold, except for approved placement in a blind trust or divestiture during a specified time period.

Further, Federal Reserve bank presidents, vice presidents, and directors must make annual and periodic financial and transaction disclosures.

Finally, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must issue rules within 90 days of enactment requiring Federal Reserve board members, presidents, vice presidents, and senior staff (1) to provide 45 days advance notice of investment transactions, and (2) to hold investments for at least 1 year from the date of transaction.</summary>
