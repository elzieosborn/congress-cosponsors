This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to publicly disclose the results of any testing for perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, conducted on or at areas surrounding DOD military installations in the United States and National Guard facilities.

DOD must also disclose the expected timing and location of any planned testing for PFAS at the specified sites.

DOD may satisfy the disclosure requirements by publishing the information, data sets, and results relating to the testing on a publicly available DOD website or in the Federal Register.

Prior to conducting any testing for PFAS, DOD must provide notice to (1) the managers of the public water system serving the areas located immediately adjacent to the military installation being tested, (2) the municipal government serving the areas located immediately adjacent to the military installation being tested, and (3) all Restoration Advisory Board members for the military installation where the testing is to occur.

DOD must test for all PFAS for which a method of measurement in drinking water has been validated by the Environmental Protection Agency.</summary>
