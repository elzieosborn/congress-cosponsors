The President must impose property-blocking sanctions on at least five of the identified individuals and entities (and visa-blocking sanctions in the case of an individual).\n\nThe State Department report must also identify individuals and entities in Belarus that knowingly engage in a significant transaction with an individual or entity that is a part of the defense or intelligence sectors of Russia's government. The President may impose sanctions on such identified individuals and entities."
