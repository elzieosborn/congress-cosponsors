  <summary date="2022-03-03T19:33:42Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Belarus Aggression Accountability Act of 2022

This bill imposes sanctions on individuals and entities in Belarus that provide support to acts of military aggression by Russia's government that violate Ukraine's sovereignty or territorial integrity.

The Department of State must periodically report to Congress an assessment of activities of the armed forces of Belarus that aid or assist such military aggression by Russia's government, as well as the identities of individuals and entities in Belarus that provide such aid. The President must impose property-blocking sanctions on at least five of the identified individuals and entities (and visa-blocking sanctions in the case of an individual).

The State Department report must also identify individuals and entities in Belarus that knowingly engage in a significant transaction with an individual or entity that is a part of the defense or intelligence sectors of Russia's government. The President may impose sanctions on such identified individuals and entities.</summary>
