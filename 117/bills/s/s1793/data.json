Plans also may not restrict such a doctor's choice of laboratories or suppliers.\n\nSuch doctors may elect to waive the application of the payment amount and choice of laboratories provisions of this bill.\n\nThe bill establishes a private right of action for a person adversely affected by a violation of this bill.\n\nThe bill does not supersede state laws regarding health insurers and dental or vision benefit plans."
