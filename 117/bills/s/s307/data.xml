  <summary date="2021-04-01T13:59:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill expands the purposes for which the Department of Commerce is authorized to make economic adjustment grants to include travel promotion, and it authorizes Commerce to cover up to 100% of the cost of a travel promotion project.

Further, the bill authorizes the appropriation of $2.25 billion to make these grants to cover costs associated with promoting safe and healthy travel practices and economic recovery in communities impacted by a decline in travel and tourism as a result of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).</summary>
