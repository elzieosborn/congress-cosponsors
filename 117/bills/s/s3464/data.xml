This bill repeals those provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act that permit employers to make an agreement with a labor union to require employees to join such union as a condition of employment.

Currently, 28 states have enacted laws prohibiting employers from compelling employees to become members of a union as a condition of employment.</summary>
