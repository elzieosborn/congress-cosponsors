In addition, the materials must be posted no later than two weeks after they are first submitted to Congress. The bill also requires the Office of Management and Budget to maintain a public website that includes details regarding the materials, including a list of the agencies that submit budget justification materials to Congress, the dates that the materials were submitted to Congress and posted online, and links to the materials."
