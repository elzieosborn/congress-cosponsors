This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to develop a curriculum for volunteers with the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) to teach underrepresented students (e.g., minority students, English learners, and children with disabilities) about entrepreneurship.

The SBA shall develop and implement a strategy to encourage partnerships between the SCORE program and community learning centers to teach this curriculum and, in developing the curriculum, collaborate with education specialists and groups with experience serving underrepresented children.

The SBA must submit a biennial report on partnerships between the SCORE program and community learning centers, the use of funds by the program, the number of students reached through the entrepreneurship curriculum, and plans for improving the curriculum.</summary>
