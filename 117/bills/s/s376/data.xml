This bill directs the Government Accountability Office to study motor vehicle recalls and the reasons why vehicle owners do not have repairs performed for vehicles subject to such recalls. It also directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study how vehicle recall notices can (1) more effectively reach vehicle owners, (2) be made easier for consumers to understand, and (3) incentivize vehicle owners to complete the repairs described in such notices.</summary>
