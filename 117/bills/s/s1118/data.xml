This bill modifies regulations for pilots within the aviation sector, including pilots who wish to share certain expenses or receive compensation for specified flights.

Specifically, the bill directs the the Department of Transportation to issue regulations authorizing (1) a pilot who wants to share aircraft operating expenses to communicate with the public regarding an aircraft flight; and (2) a pilot who has a private pilot certificate to receive compensation for flying persons or property, and not be subject to certain common carrier or commercial airliner regulations as long as the private pilot flies an aircraft with eight or fewer seats.

It also sets forth definitions for the terms common carrier and personal operator as they relate to the aviation industry.</summary>
