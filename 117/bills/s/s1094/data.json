    "text": "Made in America Act of 2021\n\nThis bill requires that materials used in carrying out federal infrastructure aid programs are produced in the United States, with exceptions.\n\nThe term produced in the United States means, in the case of\n\n iron or steel products, that all manufacturing processes for the iron or steel product, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States; manufactured products, that the product was manufactured in the United States and that the cost of the components of the manufactured product that are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States is greater than 50% of the total cost of all components of the manufactured product; and construction materials, that all manufacturing processes for the construction material occurred in the United States. The Department of Commerce must (1) issue uniform standards that define the term all manufacturing processes for purposes of this bill, and (2) take into consideration and seek to maximize the jobs benefited or created in the production of the construction material.\n\nThe bill requires that all steel, iron, manufactured products, nonferrous metals, plastic, concrete and aggregates, glass (including optical glass), lumber, and drywall used in these programs be produced in the United States.\n\nInfrastructure addressed by this bill includes federal-aid highways, railroads, public transportation infrastructure, civil aviation infrastructure, drinking water infrastructure, and stormwater infrastructure."
