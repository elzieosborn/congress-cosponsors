A depository institution must provide certain other disclosures regarding its overdraft protection program, including prompt notification of the account's overdraft status.\n\nRegarding overdraft fees, the bill\n\n limits the number of overdraft fees a consumer may be charged each month and year, provides that such fees must be reasonable, and prohibits an overdraft coverage fee if the overdraft results solely from a debit hold amount that exceeds the actual dollar amount of the transaction. The bill also prohibits a depository institution from\n\n charging a non-sufficient fund fee for any debit card transaction, or reporting negative information regarding consumer use of overdraft coverage to any consumer reporting agency when the overdraft amounts and coverage fees are paid under the terms of an overdraft coverage program."
