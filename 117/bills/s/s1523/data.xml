This bill provides statutory authority for the limitation on which type of prescription drug rebates are exempt from federal anti-kickback laws. Specifically, a rebate from a drug manufacturer to a health insurer or pharmacy benefit manager is exempt only if the rebate (1) is disclosed to the consumer at the point of sale, or (2) is a flat fee paid for pharmacy benefit management services.</summary>
