The Department of Commerce must integrate into the program minority-serving institutions, historically Black colleges or universities, and tribal colleges or universities. Further, Commerce must establish policies to promote the domestic production of technologies developed through the program.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes an advisory council for the program to make recommendations related to the manufacturing workforce."
