This bill requires the Department of Education to award grants to certain partnerships with state educational agencies to support statewide implementation of early college fast track pathways and early high school graduation fast track pathways.

The bill defines early college fast track pathways as programs of advanced coursework resulting in credit that (1) is equivalent to at least two semesters of full-time postsecondary enrollment, and (2) satisfies the requirements for a high school diploma. In addition, the bill defines early high school graduation fast track pathways as scholarships for students who graduate high school early, do not require remedial coursework in postsecondary education, and attend a public two- or four-year institution of higher education.

The bill also makes certain high school students participating in an early college fast track pathway eligible to receive Pell Grants.</summary>
