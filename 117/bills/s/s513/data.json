Further, the bill prohibits the SBA from imposing a maximum loan amount limit that is lower than $2 million for an initial disaster loan.\n\nThe bill also requires the SBA to provide a recipient of an additional disaster loan an additional advance such that the total advance amount received by the applicant is $10,000.\n\nThe SBA must submit a monthly report on the status of appropriations for disaster loans."
