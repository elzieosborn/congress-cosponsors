This bill authorizes and provides funding for additional Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loans and advances on such loans, and it modifies the requirements for providing these advances.

Specifically, the bill authorizes an additional disaster loan to a prior recipient that received such a loan during the period between January 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, up to an aggregate amount of $2 million. Further, the bill prohibits the SBA from imposing a maximum loan amount limit that is lower than $2 million for an initial disaster loan.

The bill also requires the SBA to provide a recipient of an additional disaster loan an additional advance such that the total advance amount received by the applicant is $10,000.

The SBA must submit a monthly report on the status of appropriations for disaster loans.</summary>
