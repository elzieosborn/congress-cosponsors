This bill establishes a demonstration program and requires other actions to increase access to generalist forensic services for patients who have experienced interpersonal violence. These services include medical forensic assessments, data and evidence collection, and related activities that meet the needs of both patients and law enforcement.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must award grants to institutions of higher education or Indian tribes for training health care providers to administer medical forensic assessments and treatments to patients who have experienced interpersonal violence.

Additionally, to increase access to and the quality of generalist forensic services, HHS must establish (1) a resource center for health care providers and community health aides, (2) regional learning collectives of states and hospitals, and (3) an online repository of best practices and other resources.

The bill also requires designated offices and agencies of HHS and the Department of Justice to annually report on the unmet need for and other issues related to generalist forensic services.</summary>
