This bill authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to mandate the use of larger tick sizes in the trade of the securities of emerging growth companies. Tick size is the minimum price increment of a trading instrument. Specifically, the bill authorizes the SEC to designate a tick size larger than $0.01 but not more than $0.25 for these securities. The SEC must report on the impact of potential variations in tick size for all securities.</summary>
