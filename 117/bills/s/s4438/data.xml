This bill modifies and expands work requirements under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including by repealing the temporary suspension of work requirements due to COVID-19 that allowed participants who would have lost eligibility due to such requirements to continue to receive SNAP benefits.

The bill also establishes work requirements for families residing in public housing and participating in low-income housing assistance programs by applying SNAP work requirements to such programs.</summary>
