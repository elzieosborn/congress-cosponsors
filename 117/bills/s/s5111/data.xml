This bill requires organizations that operate electric grid transmission facilities (e.g., Regional Transmission Organizations or Independent System Operators) to accept bids from certain aggregators, which procure power for groups of electricity customers participating in demand response programs. In demand response programs, end-use electricity customers are typically remunerated for voluntarily decreasing their short-term electrical consumption generally in response to compromised grid reliability or high wholesale electricity prices.</summary>
