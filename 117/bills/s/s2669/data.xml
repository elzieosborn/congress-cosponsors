This bill prohibits the use of any phthalate chemical as a food contact substance. (A food contact substance is any substance intended for use as a component of materials used in manufacturing, packing, packaging, transporting, or holding food if such use is not intended to have a technical effect in such food.)

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must review FDA-regulated products other than food to determine whether use of such products leads to exposure to phthalate chemicals. This review must be publicly available on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services.</summary>
