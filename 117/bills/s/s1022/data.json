    "text": "Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2021\n\nThis bill requires the President and specified agencies to take certain actions to increase U.S. exports to Africa.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs the President to establish a comprehensive U.S. strategy for public and private investment, trade, and development in Africa. The focus of this strategy must include (1) increasing exports of U.S. goods and services to Africa by at least 200% in real dollar value within 10 years, (2) promoting the alignment of U.S. commercial interests with development priorities in Africa, and (3) improving the competitiveness of U.S. businesses in Africa.\n\nAdditionally, the bill directs the President to\n\n designate a Special Africa Export Strategy Coordinator; develop a plan for standardized training of foreign service and economic officers; and explore opportunities to negotiate bilateral, subregional, and regional agreements to encourage trade and eliminate nontariff barriers to trade between countries. The bill requires the Department of Commerce to ensure specified levels of United States and Foreign Commercial Service officers in Africa.\n\nThe bill directs the Export-Import Bank to increase the amount of financing for projects in Africa. The bank must also make capitalization available annually for loans that compete against certain foreign loans.\n\nThe Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade must work closely with the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, among others, in maintaining a trade distribution network."
