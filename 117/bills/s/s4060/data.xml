This bill allows an individual taxpayer an inflation rebate for the first taxable year beginning in 2022. The amount of such rebate is $600 ($1,200 for joint returns), plus $600 for each of the taxpayer's dependents. The amount of the rebate is reduced for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds certain levels.

The bill imposes a 5% surcharge on individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $10 million and a 3% surcharge for incomes exceeding $25 million. It also imposes surcharges on certain high income estates and trusts.

The bill increases the maximum corporate income tax rate to 26.5% for corporate taxable income exceeding $5 million.</summary>
