Grant-funded activities include, among others, coordinating the scheduling, financing, and other logistics of abortion services.\n\nFurther, the bill prohibits individuals, entities, and states from preventing or otherwise disadvantaging an entity that is eligible to receive a grant from carrying out activities to assist individuals with accessing abortion services, including in any state in which those services are not lawful. Such activities include providing (or assisting in the provision of) abortion care and other reproductive health services that are either (1) lawful in the state where the services are provided, or (2) provided to an individual who does not reside in the state where the services are provided. The bill allows for enforcement of this prohibition through private lawsuits."
