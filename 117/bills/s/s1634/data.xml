This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take certain actions to determine whether to permit the use of a certain methodology for drug clinical trials.

Specifically, the FDA must seek to contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for the NAS to conduct a study on the effectiveness of using enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal methodology in demonstrating the efficacy of opioid drugs in treating chronic pain.

The FDA must also convene a meeting of two specified FDA advisory committees to review the NAS study and vote on whether to permit the use of this methodology in drug clinical trials.</summary>
