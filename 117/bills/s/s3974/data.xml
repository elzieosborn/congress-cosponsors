This bill prohibits consideration of certain factors, including vaccination status, in decisions about an individual's access to federally provided monoclonal antibody therapies to treat COVID-19.

As a condition of receiving the therapies from the federal government, states must ensure that providers do not consider specified demographic characteristics, veteran status, or political ideology or speech when determining a patient's eligibility for such therapies.</summary>
