  <summary date="2022-09-06T20:18:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Improving Crowdfunding Opportunities Act 

This bill reduces regulations applicable to crowdfunding securities and portals. Crowdfunding is used to raise capital through a large number of individuals investing potentially small amounts of money.

The bill exempts certain securities issued under crowdfunding regulations from state regulation of secondary transactions. It also exempts crowdfunding portals from certain anti-money laundering reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Finally, crowdfunding portals are exempted from liability for material misstatements or omissions unless the portal knowingly makes certain untrue statements or engages in fraud or deceit.</summary>
