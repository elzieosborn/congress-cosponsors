Specifically, DOE must establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced tools, technologies, and methods for low-emissions steel manufacturing. In carrying out the program and in collaboration with industry partners, institutions of higher education, and its national laboratories, DOE must support an initiative for the demonstration of low-emissions steel manufacturing."
