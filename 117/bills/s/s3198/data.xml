This bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a new form for the registration of index-linked annuities to ensure that a purchaser can make a knowledgeable decision.

The bill defines a registered index-linked annuity as an annuity that is deemed a security, that is registered with the SEC, and that is issued by an insurance company subject to state supervision. Furthermore, the returns of these annuities (1) are based on the performance of a specified benchmark index or rate, and (2) may be subject to a market value adjustment if amounts are withdrawn early.</summary>
