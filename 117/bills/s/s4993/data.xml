This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to local educational agencies for developing outdoor learning spaces on school grounds. Outdoor learning space refers to an outdoor physical space on school grounds that is (1) dedicated to meet or conduct curriculum-tied activities, (2) a dedicated space for outdoor classrooms that has seating and tables installed for students and teachers to meet regularly, or (3) a place that is used when the need arises to take learning outdoors.

Additionally, ED must maintain a clearinghouse that provides specified information, including links and information about state and local entities with expertise in outdoor learning spaces and environmental education.</summary>
