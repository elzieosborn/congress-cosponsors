This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to implement regulations regarding smoke or fume incidents on aircraft (excluding helicopters).

Specifically, the bill requires

 flight attendants, pilots, aircraft maintenance technicians, airport first responders, and emergency response teams to receive annual training on how to respond to incidents on aircraft; the FAA to develop a standardized form and system for reporting incidents involving smoke or fumes; the FAA to conduct an investigation after a report is submitted about incidents of smoke or fumes if anybody on the aircraft required medical attention; and air carriers to install and operate onboard detectors and other air quality monitoring equipment situated in the air supply system to enable pilots and maintenance technicians to locate the sources of air supply contamination, including carbon monoxide.</summary>
