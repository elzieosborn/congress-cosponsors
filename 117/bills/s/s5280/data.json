Under current law, the inspector general of the Federal Reserve Board also serves as the inspector general of the bureau.\n\nFurther, the source of funding for the bureau is changed from Federal Reserve System transfers to annual appropriations. Under current law, the transfers from the Federal Reserve System permit the bureau to be funded outside of the annual appropriations process."
