This bill restructures the leadership and funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Specifically, the bill removes the bureau from the Federal Reserve System.&#160;Additionally, the bill eliminates the positions of director and deputy director and establishes a five-person panel appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with not more than three members belonging to any one political party.

Under the bill, the inspector general of the bureau must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Under current law, the inspector general of the Federal Reserve Board also serves as the inspector general of the bureau.

Further, the source of funding for the bureau is changed from Federal Reserve System transfers to annual appropriations. Under current law, the transfers from the Federal Reserve System permit the bureau to be funded outside of the annual appropriations process.</summary>
