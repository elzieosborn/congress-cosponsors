Providers must use reimbursements received in the first half of 2021 by the end of the emergency or June 30, 2022, whichever is later.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must distribute the remaining provider relief funds by March 31, 2022. Providers must use these funds by June 30, 2023.\n\nThe bill also allows the use of the funds for workplace safety activities, such as hiring additional security personnel."
