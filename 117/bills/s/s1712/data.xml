  <summary date="2022-04-04T21:29:14Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires each state that offers pandemic unemployment assistance (PUA) or pandemic emergency unemployment compensation (PEUC) to condition benefit eligibility for a long-term unemployed individual on an employer's confirmation that work is unavailable for the unemployed individual.

Specifically, each state unemployment agency must request confirmation from the unemployed individual's most recent employer that the individual's position is not available at the time of the request. Unless the employer provides this confirmation, the state must terminate the individual's PUA or PEUC.

The bill's provisions apply only to long-term unemployed individuals who have received PUA or PEUC for more than 30 weeks of unemployment.</summary>
