This bill increases benefits to survivors of federal employees who die in the line of duty.

Specifically, the bill increases the death benefit for federal employees from $10,000 to $100,000 and increases the funeral benefit from $800 to $8,800. Both amounts must be adjusted annually for inflation. The bill also excludes the death benefit from gross income for purposes of federal taxation.</summary>
