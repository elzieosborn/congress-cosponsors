This bill provides for inpatient and outpatient treatment of eating disorders under TRICARE for dependents of members of the uniformed services. Dependents are eligible for such care regardless of their age, except with respect to residential service.

The bill also requires the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (with respect to the Coast Guard) to identify, treat, and rehabilitate members of the armed forces who have an eating disorder.

Finally, DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs must jointly develop, publish, and disseminate clinical practice criteria and guidelines on the identification and treatment of eating disorders.</summary>
