  <summary date="2022-05-17T20:27:15Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Stablecoin Transparency Act 

This bill requires a stablecoin issuer to hold all reserves associated with each fiat currency-backed stablecoin they issue in (1) certain government securities; (2) fully collateralized security repurchase agreements, or (3) U.S. dollars or other nondigital currency. A fiat currency-backed stablecoin is a digital asset backed by a nondigital currency and is redeemable on a one-to-one basis in that currency.

Each stablecoin issuer must publish monthly on their website a report on the reserves held by the issuer that has been audited by a third party.</summary>
