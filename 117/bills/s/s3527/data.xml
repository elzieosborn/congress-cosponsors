  <summary date="2022-06-14T18:09:03Z" status="Public Law">This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to transfer the name of a facility, structure, real property, or a major part of such properties (e.g., a wing) to another VA facility under certain circumstances.

Specifically, the VA may transfer the name if (1) the original property was designated with its name by law; (2) the VA no longer offers benefits or services at the original property; (3) the other property is similar in type and purpose to the original property; (4) the other property is located in a different location or a different address from the original property within the town, city, or other local government area specified in the designation; and (5) such transfer occurs at least 30 days after the VA notifies Congress of the intent to transfer the name.</summary>
