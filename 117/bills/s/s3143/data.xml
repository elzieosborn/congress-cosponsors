This bill invalidates predispute arbitration agreements relating to sexual assault claims by an employee against an employer or other employee. The bill authorizes predispute arbitration agreements relating to sexual harassment claims, but only if such agreements allow for specified actions, such as public disclosures and referrals to law enforcement. The bill applies to agreements that are entered into on or after the bill's enactment.

The Government Accountability Office must study the effects of the bill on the use of arbitration agreements and related outcomes.</summary>
