This bill provides funding through FY2024 to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for demonstration projects to train individuals for careers as home health aides, nursing assistants, or similar direct support aid workers.

HHS must award grants, in consultation with the Department of Labor, to states, tribal nations, institutions of higher education, and other organizations to carry out these projects.

In addition, the bill increases Medicare payments for services furnished by an individual who has completed training through such a project.</summary>
