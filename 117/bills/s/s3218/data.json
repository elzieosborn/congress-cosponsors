These include, among others, the right to (1) fully review and make copies of the curricula, books, and other educational materials used by the child's school; (2) access information on teachers, guest lecturers, and outside presenters; (3) access school records; and (4) visit the child during school hours.\n\nA person aggrieved by a violation of this bill, and a state on behalf of its residents, may bring a civil action for injunctive relief.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of Education to withhold federal education funds from a state for noncompliance with this bill."
