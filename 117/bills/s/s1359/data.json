The foundation may award fellowships and grants for activities relating to research, development, demonstration, maturation, or commercialization of energy and other technologies supported by DOE.\n\nIn addition, the National Energy Technology Laboratory may establish a nongovernmental Federal Laboratory-Associated Foundation to advance U.S. energy security as specified by the bill."
