The bill includes exceptions to this prohibition for law enforcement, subsistence purposes, education, conservation, or scientific research.\n\nThe Department of Commerce must certify nations with protections for sharks that are comparable to those of the United States.\n\nCommerce must revise its regulations to include rays and skates as species that are subject to the Seafood Import Monitoring Program. (The Seafood Import Monitoring Program has data reporting and recordkeeping requirements for imported fish or fish products entering U.S. commerce.)"
