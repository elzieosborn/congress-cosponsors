It also outlines the requirements for program eligibility.\n\nFurther, if the state has established a program that allows parents to use public or private funds to assist with the cost of their child attending a private school, then the state may supplement those funds with federal special education funds.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Defense must carry out a five-year pilot program to award scholarships to enable military dependent students who live on military installations to attend the public or private elementary or secondary schools their parents choose.\n\nThe bill also requires ED to return to the Treasury specified amounts made available for salaries and expenses."
