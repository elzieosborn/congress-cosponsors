Data brokers also must implement safeguards to prevent security breaches that result in the improper disclosure of such personal information. Additionally, they must register with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on an annual basis and the FTC must publish the registry. Violations of these requirements are enforceable by the FTC as unfair or deceptive business practices."
