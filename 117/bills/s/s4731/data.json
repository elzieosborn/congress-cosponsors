    "text": "Securing Allies Food in Emergencies Act or the SAFE Act\n\nThis bill requires the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop a strategy for averting a global food security crisis. The bill also relaxes a\u00a0law requiring that certain goods be transported by U.S. vessels.\n\nThe bill authorizes USAID to procure life-saving food aid commodities to provide emergency food assistance to the most vulnerable populations in countries experiencing acute food insecurity. For certain commodities procured under this authority, the bill waives a requirement that a certain percentage of the commodities must be transported by U.S. vessels (such requirements are known as federal cargo preference laws).\n\nThe bill also removes a mandate from a federal cargo preference law relating to goods obtained by the U.S. government."
