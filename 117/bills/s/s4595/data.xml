This bill establishes a community grant program for local elected or appointed officials who have disabilities.

Specifically, the Department of Labor must award grants to eligible entities in a state or associated with an Indian tribe to provide to local elected or appointed officials with disabilities reasonable accommodations needed to enable them to carry out their official work duties.

To be eligible to receive a grant an entity shall be a local government that has a local elected or appointed official with a disability who needs a reasonable accommodation to carry out official work duties for a jurisdiction that (1) is in a rural area; (2) has a population of less than 10,000; or (3) has a population of 10,000 to less than 200,000 and a poverty rate of 18% or greater.

The reasonable accommodations may include physical adaptations, specialized software, communication supports, certain devices, and transportation services.

Labor must annually report on the program's impact.</summary>
