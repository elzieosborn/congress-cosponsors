This bill provides an exception to the restriction on construction of U.S. Coast Guard vessels in foreign shipyards.

Specifically, the bill allows Coast Guard vessels to be constructed in foreign shipyards that are located in NATO countries if the cost of construction is less than the cost would be if such construction occurred in a domestic shipyard.</summary>
