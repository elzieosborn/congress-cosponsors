This bill reauthorizes through FY2025 grants for legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking victim services.

The bill also revises the grant program to allow states to receive a certain percentage of the total amount appropriated for grants to distribute to entities&#160;that provide legal assistance (e.g., pro bono representation and legal advocacy) to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault.</summary>
