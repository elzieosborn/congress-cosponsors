This bill permanently authorizes the President to impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions based on violations of human rights, and it revises the President's authority to impose these sanctions.

The bill expands the actors and abuses currently eligible for these sanctions by implementing the standard of serious human rights abuse for the imposition of sanctions.

The bill authorizes the President to impose sanctions on any foreign person (or any immediate family member of a person) who (1) is responsible for serious human rights abuse, (2) is a current or former government official who is responsible for or complicit in corruption, (3) is or has been a leader or official of an entity that has engaged in any of these activities, (4) has provided support for any of these activities, or (5) is owned or controlled by a person subject to these sanctions.

The President must report on additional steps taken through diplomacy, international engagement, and assistance to foreign or security sectors to address causes of serious human rights abuse and corruption.</summary>
