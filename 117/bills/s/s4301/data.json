Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must conduct a study to develop a model needs assessment process for grant recipients to use when determining the allocation of grant funding among prevention, treatment, and recovery support activities.\n\nThe bill also revises multiple provisions to eliminate stigmatizing terms (e.g., substance abuse) and otherwise align with current legislative drafting conventions."
