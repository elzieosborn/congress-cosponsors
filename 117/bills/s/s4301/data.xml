This bill reauthorizes through FY2027 and modifies the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, which supports state, tribal, and territorial efforts to prevent and treat substance use disorders.

Among other changes, the bill requires grant recipients to expend a portion of the grant on recovery support services. Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must conduct a study to develop a model needs assessment process for grant recipients to use when determining the allocation of grant funding among prevention, treatment, and recovery support activities.

The bill also revises multiple provisions to eliminate stigmatizing terms (e.g., substance abuse) and otherwise align with current legislative drafting conventions.</summary>
