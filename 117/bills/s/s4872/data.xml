This bill provides assistance to rural, multifamily rental-housing projects and tenants.

Specifically, the bill provides statutory authority for a Department of Agriculture (USDA) program that supports the preservation and revitalization of affordable housing projects that are financed with USDA loans.

Further, the bill makes changes to certain USDA rental assistance programs including by authorizing the USDA to provide rural housing vouchers for low-income households (including those not receiving rental assistance) residing in certain properties financed with or insured by USDA loans.

The USDA must also report on preserving the affordability of rental projects financed by USDA loans for low-income families.</summary>
