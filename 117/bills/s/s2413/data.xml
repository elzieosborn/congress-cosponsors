This bill expands certain requirements relating to the eligibility of inmates of public institutions for Medicaid.

Currently, state Medicaid programs (1) may suspend, but not terminate, a juvenile's Medicaid eligibility while the juvenile is an inmate; and (2) must restore coverage or determine a juvenile's eligibility, as applicable, upon the juvenile's release. The bill extends these provisions to all inmates of public institutions, regardless of age.</summary>
