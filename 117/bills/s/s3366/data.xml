This bill permits certain NATO-affiliated dredge vessels to operate in the United States. The vessels must be (1) documented under the laws of a NATO member country, (2) built by a NATO member country or a major non-NATO ally, and (3) majority-owned and -operated by entities incorporated in NATO member countries. (Current law generally requires that such vessels be domestically built and owned.)</summary>
