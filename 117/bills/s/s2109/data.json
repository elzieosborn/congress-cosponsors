SDRs may be exchanged between member countries and may also be exchanged for currencies.)\n\nSpecifically, U.S. representatives to the IMF may not vote for SDR allocations to a country if the President finds that the country's government has (1) committed genocide in the last 10 years, or (2) repeatedly supported international terrorism."
