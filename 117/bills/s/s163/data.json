In particular, the guidance must address how a state workforce development board can (1) utilize federal resources available to meet telecommunications industry workforce needs; (2) promote and improve recruitment in qualified industry-led workforce development programs, including the Telecommunications Industry Registered Apprenticeship Program; and (3) ensure the safety of tower climbers and other members of the telecommunications workforce.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress a report that estimates the number of skilled telecommunications workers that will be required to build and maintain (1) broadband infrastructure in rural areas, and (2) the 5G wireless infrastructure needed to support 5G wireless technology."
