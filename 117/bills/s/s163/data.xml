  <summary date="2022-03-03T11:22:37Z" status="Reported to Senate">Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act

This bill establishes measures to address the workforce needs of the telecommunications industry.

Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish an interagency working group to develop recommendations for addressing these workforce needs.

In addition, the bill requires the Department of Labor to establish and issue guidance on how states can address the workforce needs and safety of the telecommunications industry. In particular, the guidance must address how a state workforce development board can (1) utilize federal resources available to meet telecommunications industry workforce needs; (2) promote and improve recruitment in qualified industry-led workforce development programs, including the Telecommunications Industry Registered Apprenticeship Program; and (3) ensure the safety of tower climbers and other members of the telecommunications workforce.

The Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress a report that estimates the number of skilled telecommunications workers that will be required to build and maintain (1) broadband infrastructure in rural areas, and (2) the 5G wireless infrastructure needed to support 5G wireless technology.</summary>
