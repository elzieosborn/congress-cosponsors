This bill imposes certain requirements on applicants for Office of Refugee Resettlement grants to open or fund shelter facilities for unaccompanied alien children.

Specifically an applicant for such a grant must (1) disclose in the application any adverse action (generally an adverse criminal or regulatory action relating to a government contract or the care of children) taken against the applicant in the five-year period before the application, and (2) be licensed under state law to operate the facility in question.

The Department of Health and Human Services must seek to collaborate with state regulatory agencies to review state databases for information about adverse actions taken against such applicants.</summary>
