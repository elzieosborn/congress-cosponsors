This bill prohibits government-sponsored enterprises (i.e., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) from purchasing or acquiring a mortgage secured by an investor property loan (i.e., a property comprised of 1-to-4 family dwelling units that is not the principal residence or a second home of the borrower) 18 months after the date of enactment. Further, these enterprises must implement a plan to gradually reduce the purchase and acquisition of such loans.</summary>
