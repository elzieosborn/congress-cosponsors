This bill requires the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to coordinate with the Forest Service on a program that supports the development and dissemination of research concerning natural infrastructure (i.e., constructed landscape features and systems that employ nature-based solutions that promote, use, restore, or emulate natural ecological processes). The USGS must also annually assess the costs and effectiveness of natural infrastructure projects.</summary>
