  <summary date="2023-07-31T16:57:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill prohibits the use of federal funds to allow noncitizens to vote in any election in the District of Columbia (DC). Further, DC must certify that it does not allow noncitizens to vote in elections as a condition of receiving any federal funds.

Federal law bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections; however, the DC Council passed a bill on October 18, 2022, that allows noncitizens who meet residency and other requirements to vote in local elections.</summary>
