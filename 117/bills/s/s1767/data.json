Currently, a member may be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the credit union membership present at a special meeting.\n\nThe member may request a hearing from the board of directors. After the hearing, the board shall hold a vote on expelling the member.\n\nThe expelled member may request reinstatement through a two-thirds vote of the members present at a meeting.\n\nMember conduct that may be cause for expulsion includes\n\n a material loss to the credit union, a violation of the credit union membership agreement, a substantial disruption to the operations of a credit union, fraud or attempted fraud, and other illegal or inappropriate behavior."
