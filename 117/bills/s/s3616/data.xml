This bill requires certain actions to support access to higher education for children and youth who are homeless or in foster care.

Among other provisions, the bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) participating in financial aid programs to give priority to these students for any on-campus housing during and between academic terms. Further, the bill requires IHEs to designate a staff liaison to assist these students with support services, programs, and community resources in a variety of areas, including financial aid and housing.

The bill also requires these students to receive in-state tuition rates at public IHEs. Under current law, some states offer these students in-state tuition or provide them with tuition waivers.</summary>
