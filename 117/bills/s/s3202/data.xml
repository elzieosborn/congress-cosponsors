  <summary date="2022-06-24T21:14:37Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill terminates the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families and addresses related issues. (The task force's duties include identifying children separated from their families on the U.S.-Mexico border between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021.)

Specifically, the bill rescinds (1) the February 2, 2021, executive order that established the task force; and (2) all policy and legal decisions issued, settlement agreements (or consent decrees) entered into, and immigration benefits provided pursuant to that executive order.

Furthermore, the Department of Justice (DOJ) may not enter into a settlement agreement pertaining to specified issues, such as the separation of family members by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, unless the Government Accountability Office certifies that the agreement complies with federal law and regulations concerning the collection and compromise of federal claims.

The Office of Personnel Management must withhold the salaries of all federal employees who serve on the task force and deposit the amounts into an account for paying judgments against the United States. The withholding must continue until the deposited amount is equal to the amount paid to aliens under settlements entered into pursuant to the executive order.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must publicly publish a report on the task force with information such as an accounting of the task force's incurred costs and all communications between task force members and nongovernmental entities.

DOJ and the OMB must also publicly publish all settlement agreements entered into pursuant to the executive order.</summary>
