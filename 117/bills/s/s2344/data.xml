  <summary date="2022-08-31T16:11:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Supporting Our Direct Care Workforce and Family Caregivers Act

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to set up a national technical assistance center and grant program to support the direct care workforce and family caregivers. HHS must consult with the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services on these efforts.

Specifically, HHS must establish a national technical assistance center to develop recommendations for curricula to educate and train direct care workers and family caregivers, disseminate strategies to strengthen the direct care workforce, and carry out related activities.

Additionally, HHS must award grants for recruiting, training, and retaining direct care workers and supporting family caregivers. Eligible grantees include state and tribal governments, certain labor unions and employers, institutions of higher education, and other nonprofits, as well as partnerships of such entities. Grant recipients must agree to consult with the state Medicaid agency unless that agency receives the grant directly or as part of a partnership.</summary>
