  <summary date="2022-05-12T18:57:30Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Justice for Native Survivors of Sexual Violence Act

This bill expands the special criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts over crimes of domestic violence to include other crimes and types of defendants.

Specifically, the bill expands jurisdiction to include the crimes of obstruction of justice, sexual violence, sex trafficking, and stalking. The bill also allows tribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over defendants regardless of whether the defendant has ties to the tribe.

The bill also (1) authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reimburse tribal governments for related expenses (e.g., arrests, prosecution, and detention); and (2) reauthorizes DOJ grants to support tribal criminal justice systems and services.</summary>
