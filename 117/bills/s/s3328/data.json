The bill also allows tribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over defendants regardless of whether the defendant has ties to the tribe.\n\nThe bill also (1) authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reimburse tribal governments for related expenses (e.g., arrests, prosecution, and detention); and (2) reauthorizes DOJ grants to support tribal criminal justice systems and services."
