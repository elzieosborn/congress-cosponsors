Specifically, states may use such grants to expand services, provide support to community-based organizations, purchase emergency supplies, and provide temporary direct payments to families caring for children under protective services supervision that are awaiting approval for government assistance, among other uses. The bill does not require states to match funding under these grants.\n\nThe bill also provides funding to operate and expand the national child abuse hotline."
