This bill provides tax incentives for the production of clean hydrogen and for investment in clean hydrogen production facilities. Specifically, it allows a new business-related tax credit for the production of specified amounts of qualified clean hydrogen. The bill defines qualified clean hydrogen as hydrogen that is produced through a process that, as compared to hydrogen produced by steam-methane reforming of nonrenewable natural gas, achieves a percentage reduction in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions that is not less than 50%.

The bill also expands the energy tax credit to include clean hydrogen production facilities.</summary>
