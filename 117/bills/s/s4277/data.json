These rights and resources must exclude abortion services.\n\nAdditionally, the IHE must establish a protocol to meet with students who believe they were discriminated against based on pregnancy.\n\nThe IHE must also provide pregnancy-related questions to enrolled students and annually submit compiled responses to the Department of Education."
