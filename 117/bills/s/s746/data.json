However, it shall not apply to specified steel and aluminum import adjustments.\n\nThe Department of Defense (currently, the Department of Commerce) must\n\n investigate the national security threat of a U.S. import, and report to the President the results of that investigation. Commerce must provide recommendations regarding such imports upon request by the President."
