(Current coastwise law, commonly known as the Jones Act, generally requires that vessels transporting cargo domestically be U.S.-built, -owned, and -crewed.)\n\nThe FMCSA and the Coast Guard must also prioritize the completion of security screenings and credentialing of maritime workers.\n\nThe Department of Defense must (1) inventory its intermodal equipment (e.g., trailers and chassis used to transport shipping containers) to identify equipment available for loan to trucking companies to relieve congestion at U.S. ports, and (2) establish a process to allow trucking companies to request the loan of such equipment.\n\nThe bill also requires the identification and designation of federal land located near U.S. ports for use as overflow areas for empty cargo containers."
