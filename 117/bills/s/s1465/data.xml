This bill establishes a competitive grant program within the Department of Transportation (DOT) for projects to improve highway-rail grade crossings. In carrying out the program, DOT must cooperate with the Federal Railroad Administration.

Specifically, DOT must award the grants to state, tribal, or local governments, public port authorities, metropolitan planning organizations, or a consortia of such entities. Grant recipients may use funds for planning and implementation of projects involving grade separation or closure, track relocation, or other means to improve the mobility of people and goods at highway-rail grade crossings.</summary>
