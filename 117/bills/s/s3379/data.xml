This bill requires the Department of Justice to designate one or more entities to process requests for Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background checks from employers of private security officers when those checks are not available through the state of employment.

Under current law, employers must request FBI background checks through a state agency. However, a state may decline to participate in this background check system.</summary>
