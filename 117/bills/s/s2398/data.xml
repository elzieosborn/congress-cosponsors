This bill specifies that alternative fueling infrastructure, renewable energy generation facilities, electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure, and broadband infrastructure and conduits are utility facilities for purposes of accommodations within a right-of-way on a federal-aid highway. The bill also encourages states to implement certain vegetation management practices (e.g., increased mowing heights and planting pollinator-friendly habitats) along such rights-of-way.</summary>
