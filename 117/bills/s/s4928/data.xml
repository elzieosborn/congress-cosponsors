This bill expands eligibility for a compensation program for individuals who developed a beryllium-related illness or sensitivity and who were exposed to beryllium while working at certain Department of Energy facilities or for beryllium vendors. (Beryllium is a metal with various industrial applications, including in the production of nuclear weapons; inhalation of beryllium dust or fumes can have adverse health effects.)</summary>
