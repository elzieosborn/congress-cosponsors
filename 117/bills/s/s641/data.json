In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must consider certain factors in issuing certificates of public convenience and necessity for natural gas projects. Finally, the bill prohibits the holder of a certification of public convenience and necessity from exercising the right of eminent domain for a pipeline designed to export liquefied natural gas to a foreign country."
