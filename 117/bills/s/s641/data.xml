This bill limits the use of eminent domain to take private property for the construction and operation of a natural gas pipeline facility.

Specifically, this bill ends the legal presumption that natural gas exports are by definition in the public interest. In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must consider certain factors in issuing certificates of public convenience and necessity for natural gas projects. Finally, the bill prohibits the holder of a certification of public convenience and necessity from exercising the right of eminent domain for a pipeline designed to export liquefied natural gas to a foreign country.</summary>
