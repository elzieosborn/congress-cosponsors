Transferred programs and offices include the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership, the Manufacturing USA Program, the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, and the Office of Manufacturing.\n\nThe bill also permanently reauthorizes the U.S. Manufacturing Council of the International Trade Administration as the National Manufacturing Advisory Council, and it tasks the council with (1) ensuring regular communication between the federal government and the U.S. manufacturing sector, (2) advising the Department of Commerce on government policies and programs that affect U.S. manufacturing, and (3) ensuring the United States remains the leading destination for investment in manufacturing throughout the world."
