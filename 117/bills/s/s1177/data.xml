This bill imposes additional requirements to acquire an E visa (for an investor or trader who is a national of a foreign country with a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States, or an Australian specialty worker).

Specifically, if an alien became the national of a foreign country with a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States through a financial investment in that foreign country and the alien had not previously received an E visa, the alien must have been domiciled in that foreign country for a continuous period of at least three years at any point before applying for an E visa.</summary>
