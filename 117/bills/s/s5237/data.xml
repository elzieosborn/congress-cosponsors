  <summary date="2023-03-01T19:39:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Compressed Gas Cylinder Safety and Oversight Improvements Act of 2022 

This bill expands requirements for foreign manufacturers of cylinders used for transporting hazardous materials in the United States (e.g., compressed gas cylinders). Current regulations require foreign manufacturers to apply for approval from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration for testing such cylinders outside of the United States.

For example, the bill requires that, to obtain an approval, manufacturers must answer in their applications specified questions, including whether the manufacturer is or has been subject to various civil or criminal penalties.

The bill limits an approval to one year; however, the administration may extend an approval for five years if the manufacturer meets certain requirements.</summary>
