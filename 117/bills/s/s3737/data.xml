This bill sets out programs and activities to support the communication and dissemination of evidence-based public health information, with a particular focus on communication during public health emergencies.

Specifically, it temporarily establishes an advisory committee to report on and make recommendations about, for example, the role and impact of misinformation on responses to public health emergencies and strategies to improve communication during such emergencies. The committee terminates four years after the bill's enactment.

Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services must support the development of initiatives that promote fact-based public health and medical information to the public and educate the public on identifying misinformation.</summary>
