This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to maintain a publicly available, searchable database that contains solicitations for infant formula bids under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Under current law, state agencies must control infant formula costs in the WIC program through competitive bidding for infant formula rebate contracts. The bill requires state WIC agencies to provide USDA with open solicitations for these competitive bids to populate the database.</summary>
