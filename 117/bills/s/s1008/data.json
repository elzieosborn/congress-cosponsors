The PILT program compensates local governments for tax revenue lost due to tax-exempt federal lands within their boundaries.\n\nInterior must annually report on the value of land covered by the PILT program, the tax revenue the land would generate if privately owned, and how PILT payments could more accurately reflect that tax revenue."
