The President must issue a plan to implement and operationalize the strategy.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security shall lead a national exercise to test and enhance the operationalization of the implementation plan.\n\nThe President must provide recommendations for (1) actions that should be taken to prepare the United States to implement the strategy, increase readiness, and address preparedness gaps; and (2) additional authorities that should be considered to more effectively implement the strategy."
