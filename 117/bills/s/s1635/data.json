An alien seeking such a visa must have health insurance for the duration of the stay.\n\nAn alien who holds such a visa may not change to another nonimmigrant visa classification except in certain limited instances.\n\nIf an alien has been approved for a family-based immigrant visa and is waiting for one to become available, the alien may obtain a family visitor visa if the alien meets the eligibility requirements."
