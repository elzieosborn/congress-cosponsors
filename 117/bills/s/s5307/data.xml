For example, the bill prohibits intercollegiate athletic associations from engaging in certain acts of sex discrimination, including discrimination through (1) the rules it sets for intercollegiate athletics; (2) the facilities, amenities, and goods or services provided for competitions; or (3) the distribution of revenues or other benefits.

The bill also requires institutions of higher education to periodically report to the Department of Education certain data related to men's and women's sports programs.</summary>
