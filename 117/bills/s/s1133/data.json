This disease is caused by damage to or disease affecting any valve that controls blood flow in the heart.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health must consult with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to conduct or support research on the disease, including on mitral valve prolapse. This occurs when the valve between the chambers of the left side of the heart seals improperly.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must develop best practices to treat valvular heart disease. The CDC may also carry out other projects to increase awareness of and reduce deaths from the disease."
