  <summary date="2022-12-23T22:23:20Z" status="Reported to Senate">Improving Government Efficiency and Workforce Development through Federal Executive Boards Act of 2022

This bill addresses the perpetuation, administration, and funding of Federal Executive Boards.

Specifically, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA), shall continue to support the existence of the Federal Executive Boards in geographic areas outside the District of Columbia (DC) metropolitan area.

Federal Executive Board means an interagency entity

 established by OPM, in coordination with OMB and GSA; located in a geographic area with a high concentration of federal employees outside the DC metropolitan area; focused on strengthening the management and administration of agency activities and coordination among local federal officers to implement national initiatives in that geographic area. OPM must develop a set of criteria to establish and evaluate the number and locations of such boards that (1) factor in contemporary federal workforce data as of the date of this bill's enactment; and (2) is informed by annual changes in workforce data, including the geographic disbursement of the federal workforce and the role of remote work options.

The bill sets forth provisions regarding administration and oversight, and governance and activities, of such boards.

OPM, in coordination with OMB and GSA, must establish a Federal Executive Board Fund within OPM for financing essential board functions for the purposes of staffing and operating expenses.</summary>
