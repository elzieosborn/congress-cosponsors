This bill exempts certain financial companies not primarily regulated by either a federal banking agency or the Federal Housing Finance Agency from requirements to conduct stress tests. These stress tests evaluate the ability of companies to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions.

However, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may require exempted financial companies under their regulatory authority to conduct stress tests.</summary>
