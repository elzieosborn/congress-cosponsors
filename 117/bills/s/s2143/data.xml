This bill allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to terminate certain contracts under the National Flood Insurance Program on the basis of detrimental conduct to the program by a covered entity (an attorney, law firm, consultant, or third-party company that provides certain services under the contract). Specifically, on such basis, FEMA may terminate a contract between a covered entity&#160;and a Write Your Own company (a property and casualty company that writes and services federal standard flood insurance policies in its own name).

FEMA shall establish a process for a covered entity to appeal such a termination.

Neither FEMA nor a Write Your Own company is required to make an early-termination payout to a covered entity with respect to a contract terminated under the&#160;bill.</summary>
