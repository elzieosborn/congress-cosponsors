Such requirement increases to 65% at the start of 2024 and 75% at the start of 2029.\n\nSuch requirements shall not apply to manufactured articles that consist wholly or predominantly of iron, steel, or a combination of iron and steel.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes price preferences for domestic goods that the federal government designates as critical to U.S. supply chains."
