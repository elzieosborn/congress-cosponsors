This bill provides for enhanced domestic content requirements in federal procurement.

Specifically, the bill requires that more than 60% (currently, 55%) of the value of the components of products that the federal government purchases be made in the United States. Such requirement increases to 65% at the start of 2024 and 75% at the start of 2029.

Such requirements shall not apply to manufactured articles that consist wholly or predominantly of iron, steel, or a combination of iron and steel.

Additionally, the bill establishes price preferences for domestic goods that the federal government designates as critical to U.S. supply chains.</summary>
