The guidance makes individuals eligible to receive regular unemployment compensation and COVID-19 PUA if they (1) refuse an offer to work or return to work because of certain safety concerns, (2) provide services to educational institutions or educational service agencies, and (3) experience a reduction of hours or a temporary or permanent layoff.\n\nA recipient of such PUA before enactment of this bill is not required to repay it. However, this requirement excludes individuals who, as of such enactment, were approved for PUA but have not received it."
