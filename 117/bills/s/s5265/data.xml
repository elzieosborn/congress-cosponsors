This bill requires the Department of Defense to submit a report identifying goods and services from the United States that China relies upon and U.S. military procurement practices that are reliant on trade with China. The bill also requires the Department of the Treasury to submit a sanctions strategy that could, in response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan (1) limit China's ability to acquire petroleum and military materiel, (2) diminish the ability of the Chinese industrial base to replenish defense articles, and (3) inhibit China's ability to evade sanctions.</summary>
