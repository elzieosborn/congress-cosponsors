DHS may waive these eligibility requirements for humanitarian, family unity, public interest, or exceptional military service reasons.\n\nA noncitizen veteran who obtains permanent resident status under this bill shall be eligible for (1) naturalization through service in the Armed Forces, and (2) military and veterans benefits as if they had not been removed (or ordered removed) from the United States.\n\nFor a noncitizen veteran in removal proceedings or subject to a final removal order, the Department of Justice (DOJ) must determine whether the veteran is eligible for permanent resident status under this bill. If the veteran is eligible, DOJ must adjust the veteran's status.\n\nThe bill also protects noncitizen veterans or service members from being removed from the United States unless the veteran has been convicted of a crime of violence."
