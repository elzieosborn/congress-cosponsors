    "text": "Verifiable, Orderly, and Timely Election Results Act\n\nThis bill establishes certain federal standards for voting by mail and reporting federal election results. It also requires states to establish certain election measures.\n\nFirst, the bill establishes federal standards for (1) requesting a mail-in ballot; (2) confirming the identity, registration, and eligibility of an individual requesting a mail-in ballot; and (3) submitting a mail-in ballot. In particular, the bill requires mail-in ballots to be received by the time the polls close on election day.\n\nIn addition, the bill makes it unlawful to possess or return a mail-in ballot completed by another person (commonly referred to as ballot harvesting), with exceptions. A violator is subject to criminal penalties\u2014a fine, a prison term of up to one year, or both.\n\nThe bill also establishes standards for reporting federal election results, including by requiring states to count all eligible ballots within 24 hours after the election.\n\nFinally, each state must, in order to receive election assistance funds, have in effect certain laws related to voting. For example, states must require voters to present identification to cast a ballot in a federal election."
