    "text": "Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in U.S. Customs and Border Protection Custody Act\n\nThis bill imposes requirements and standards related to the care of aliens in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody.\n\nCBP must conduct an initial health screening of each individual in custody to identify those with acute conditions and high-risk vulnerabilities and to provide appropriate healthcare. CBP must conduct the screening within 12 hours of each\u00a0individual's arrival at a CBP facility, and within 6 hours for certain priority individuals such as children and individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe bill imposes various requirements related to providing such screenings, such as providing interpreters, chaperones, and mental health treatment when necessary.\n\nCBP must ensure detainees have access to drinking water, toilets, sanitation facilities, hygiene products, food, and shelter. The bill imposes certain standards relating to such requirements, such as the minimum amount of drinking water for each detainee and the acceptable temperature range of the shelters.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must enter into memoranda of understanding with various government agencies to address instances when surge capacity is necessary.\n\nThe DHS Office of the Inspector General must conduct unannounced inspections of ports of entry, border patrol stations, and detention facilities and report the results to Congress. The Government Accountability Office must assess CBP's management of such facilities, whether CBP and DHS processes are in compliance with this bill's requirements, and the behavior of CBP personnel in carrying out this bill.\n\nDHS shall publicly release on its website, on a quarterly basis, aggregate data on complaints of sexual abuse at CBP facilities."
