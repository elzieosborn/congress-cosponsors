Under current law, the first application (or supplement) for a specific product and indication to be designated a QIDP shall receive priority review for market approval by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nGenerally, a biological product designated as a QIDP is one that acts on bacteria or fungi and is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection.\n\nHowever, a biological product with a QIDP designation shall not receive the market exclusivity extension currently available to drugs that receive the designation."
