This bill authorizes competitive grants to enhance services for school-aged youth with mental and behavioral health issues that can lead to poor academic performance, depression, and other negative outcomes.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) may award the grants to state or local educational agencies or Indian tribes. SAMHSA must ensure geographic representation, including with respect to rural areas, in the distribution of grant funds.</summary>
