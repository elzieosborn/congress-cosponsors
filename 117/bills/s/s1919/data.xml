This bill modifies requirements for the Railway-Highway Crossings Program.

Specifically, the bill (1) requires the Department of Transportation to set aside highway safety improvement funds for states for the replacement of functionally obsolete warning and protective devices at railway-highway crossings, and (2) revises the amount of incentive payments a state may provide a local government for permanent closure by such government of public at-grade railway-highway crossings.</summary>
