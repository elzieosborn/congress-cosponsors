This bill reauthorizes through FY2027 and revises the American History for Freedom grant program.

The bill renames the program as the American Civics and History Education Program.

The bill authorizes the Department of Education to award grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) at least once every three years to establish or strengthen academic programs to promote American political thought and history and the history, achievements, and impact of American representative democracy and constitutional democracies globally. Currently, these grants are awarded to IHEs for three years and are focused on traditional American history and the history and achievements of Western civilization.

IHEs may use grants to support additional activities, such as collaborating with federal or state humanities programs and using open educational resources.</summary>
