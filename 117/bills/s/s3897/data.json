The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must issue guidance on this bill's implementation, including criteria to determine whether IT qualifies as a legacy IT system.\n\nEach agency must transfer to schools or nonprofit organizations any educationally useful federal equipment that the agency no longer uses.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on this bill's implementation and how this bill functions alongside other IT modernization offices, policies, and programs."
