This bill prohibits school curriculums or teachings that promote certain concepts based on race.

Specifically, the bill prohibits schools from promoting concepts that result in a racially hostile environment, which the bill defines as an environment in which (1) racial discrimination has created an adverse setting, (2) an individual is fearful due to a racially intimidating or offensive environment, or (3) an individual is restricted from participating in or benefiting from a program or activity on the basis of race.

Prohibited concepts include the idea that (1) one race is inherently superior to another, (2) the United States is fundamentally racist, and (3) an individual bears responsibility for the past actions of others of the same race.

The bill makes the use of such curriculums or teachings a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs or activities. Any intimidation, threat, or other interference with respect to an individual's rights or participation in related proceedings (e.g., the ability to file complaints about the use of prohibited curriculums) shall also be considered a violation of Title VI.

The bill applies to elementary and secondary schools and to colleges and universities.</summary>
