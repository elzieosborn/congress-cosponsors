The bill authorizes federal courts to sentence a parent or caregiver to participation in the FAMILIES Program as a condition of supervised release or instead of probation or prison.\n\nAt the state level, the bill funds grants for states to replicate successful state parenting sentencing alternatives programs that have the potential to keep parents out of prison.\n\nThe bill also provides funds for a study on the effects of incarceration on children of incarcerated parents and for training district court judges to carry out the FAMILIES Program."
