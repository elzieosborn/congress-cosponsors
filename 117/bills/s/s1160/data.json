    "text": "Fighting Emerging Narcotics Through Additional Nations to Yield Lasting Results Act or the FENTANYL Results Act\n\nThis bill creates two programs, establishes a reporting requirement, and otherwise modifies provisions to facilitate global cooperation against the trafficking of certain drugs, specifically synthetic controlled substances (such as fentanyl) and new psychoactive substances.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Department of State to establish a program to provide capacity-building assistance for law enforcement agencies of specified countries to identify, track, and detect such drugs. The State Department must also carry out an international exchange program for drug demand reduction experts to provide educational and professional development on demand-reduction matters relating to the illicit use of drugs, including synthetic drugs.\n\nThe bill requires the State Department to include new sections in its annual international narcotics control strategy report that contain (1) an assessment of the countries likely involved in the trafficking of synthetic controlled substances and new psychoactive substances, and (2) policies of responding to new psychoactive substances.\n\nThe bill also expands the definition of major illicit drug producing country to include countries that produce synthetic drugs. Under current law, foreign assistance may be withheld from such countries."
