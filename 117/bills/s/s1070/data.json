(Currently, an alien may apply for asylum upon being physically present or arriving in the United States, subject to certain restrictions.)\n\nIn addition, if an alien was in a qualifying third country (generally one where the alien's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of certain characteristics) during the 180 days before being admitted into the United States, the alien may not apply for asylum unless the alien proves that (1) the alien applied for and was denied asylum or equivalent status in that third country, or (2) the conditions in the alien's country of nationality have significantly worsened since the alien was in the third country."
