The Inspector General of the Department of Commerce must conduct oversight related to the grants.\n\nThe bill also establishes (1) a center to coordinate with state, local, and regional governments about cybersecurity threats to next generation 9-1-1 systems and strategies to detect and prevent such threats; and (2) an advisory board to provide the NTIA with recommendations about next generation 9-1-1 activities."
