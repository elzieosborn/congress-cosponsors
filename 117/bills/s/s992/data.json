The bill also directs IHEs to use a specified portion of federal work-study grants to compensate students for civic engagement activities.\n\nSpecifically, the bill (1) requires IHEs to make every reasonable effort to distribute voter registration applications to each of their students at least twice a year, (2) authorizes grants to IHEs that greatly exceed the requirements governing the distribution of voter registration applications, and (3) allows civil actions against IHEs that violate the requirements.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires IHEs to use a specified portion of federal work-study grants to compensate students who are employed in civic engagement activities, including voter registration, nonpartisan voter engagement, and voter participation work."
