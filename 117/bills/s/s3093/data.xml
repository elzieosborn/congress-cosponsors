This bill makes changes in the provision of federal disaster assistance to underserved communities and other specified recipients.

Underserved community means populations sharing a particular characteristic and geographic communities that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life.

Specifically, the bill increases the federal cost share to a local government or Indian tribal government in connection with a second or subsequent major disaster during any three-year period.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may provide assistance to a state, local government, or Indian tribal government to reimburse the cost of coordinating food delivery, production, and distribution in the event of a major disaster.

FEMA must provide direct technical assistance to eligible entities for applications and prioritize specified categories of communities, including underserved communities, those that have demonstrated a compelling need, and those that are exposed to increased hazards or vulnerabilities.

The bill increases the federal cost share for a recipient (1) that will use the assistance in, or for the benefit of persons who are members of, an undeserved community; or (2) who is in, or who is a member of, an underserved community.</summary>
