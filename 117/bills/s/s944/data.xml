This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish a freestanding program that expands broadband access in unserved areas and underserved areas and for unserved anchor institutions (e.g., elementary schools, libraries, and museums) by using reverse auctions. The program must be separate from any universal service program and may not base the eligibility of a funding recipient on their eligibility or ineligibility for other telecommunications programs.</summary>
