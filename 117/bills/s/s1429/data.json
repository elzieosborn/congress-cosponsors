If the office finds such proximate cause, then the Department of the Treasury must establish a fund to compensate qualifying victims of the bombing (generally, former employees of Pan American who were part of an earlier lawsuit seeking compensation from Libya for the bombing).\n\nThe Foreign Claims Settlement Commission must establish a process for claimants to apply for compensation from the fund."
