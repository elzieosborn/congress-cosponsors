Specifically, HHS must establish reference prices based on certain factors, including drug prices in listed countries. Retail prices of covered drugs under specified federal health programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) may not exceed the established reference prices. Drugs must also be available at such prices to uninsured individuals and to individuals with private health insurance."
