The report must also include a tax gap analysis and a comprehensive analysis and description of whether there are any racial disparities in its enforcement activities or audits.\n\nThe bill also applies false claims rules to claims, records, or statements made by taxpayers whose gross income equals or exceeds $10 million for the taxable year, and the damages sustained by the government due to such false claims exceed $1 million."
