This bill adds Nystrom Elementary School to the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park in California.

The Department of the Interior may also add certain other areas to the park. Such other areas must

 be determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places; have a direct connection to World War II home front themes in Richmond, California; and relate to the purpose, significance, and interpretive themes of the park. Interior may enter into cooperative agreements with the West Contra Costa Unified School District and other appropriate public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions to carry out the purposes of this bill.

Interior shall coordinate visitor interpretation of the Nystrom Elementary School site with the West Contra Costa Unified School District.</summary>
