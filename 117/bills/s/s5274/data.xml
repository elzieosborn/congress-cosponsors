  <summary date="2023-08-28T15:05:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill limits attorneys' fees for claims involving individuals who were exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987.

Further, the bill requires an attorney representing an individual for such a claim to disburse the funds of any judgment or award to that individual before collecting any compensation for services rendered.

The bill also establishes certain penalties for (1) a person who solicits, contracts, charges, receives, or attempts such actions with respect to the preparation, presentation, or prosecution of a veterans benefits claim; and (2) any legal representative who charges, demands, receives, or collects for services rendered in connection with certain tort claims or certain claims related to Camp Lejeune.</summary>
