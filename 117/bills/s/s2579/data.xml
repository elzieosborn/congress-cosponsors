This bill allows bikeshare projects to be eligible for federal funding.

The bill also makes shared micromobility (including bikesharing and shared scooter systems) projects eligible for funds if they shift traffic demand to non-peak hours or other transportation modes, increase vehicle occupancy rates, or otherwise reduce demand for roads.</summary>
