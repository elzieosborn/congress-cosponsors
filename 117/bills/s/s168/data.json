This authorization applies during, and for at least 180 days after, the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency.\n\nSpecifically, subject to scope of practice and other requirements, a health care professional may provide health services in any U.S. jurisdiction based on that individual's authorization to practice in any one state or territory.\n\nThe bill also provides certain related powers to health care professional regulatory bodies, such as medical boards. Specifically, a regulatory body may investigate and take disciplinary actions against a professional who provides services pursuant to this bill to a patient in that body's jurisdiction."
