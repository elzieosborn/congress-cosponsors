If an alien in Department of Justice or Department of Homeland Security custody is required to attend a removal proceeding, this bill requires DOJ or DHS to issue such a written notice to the alien before removing or paroling that alien from its custody.\n\nFurthermore, under this bill, an alien who fails to attend a required removal proceeding after receiving written notice shall lose any immigration status or benefit the alien may have, absent exceptional circumstances."
