  <summary date="2021-07-12T16:38:05Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill increases the penalties for an alien who fails to appear at a removal proceeding and modifies related procedures.

Currently, an alien who misses a required removal proceeding shall be ordered removed from the United States if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement proves that the alien had received written notice to appear at the removal proceeding. If an alien in Department of Justice or Department of Homeland Security custody is required to attend a removal proceeding, this bill requires DOJ or DHS to issue such a written notice to the alien before removing or paroling that alien from its custody.

Furthermore, under this bill, an alien who fails to attend a required removal proceeding after receiving written notice shall lose any immigration status or benefit the alien may have, absent exceptional circumstances.</summary>
