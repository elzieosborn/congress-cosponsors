This bill places restrictions on federal funding to any preschool, kindergarten, or elementary or secondary school with respect to mask mandates.

Specifically, the bill prohibits a preschool, kindergarten, or elementary or secondary school from receiving federal funds if it (1) mandates that students wear face masks while on school grounds or engaged in school-sponsored activities, or (2) limits participation in school activities for students who choose to not wear a face mask on school grounds or while engaged in school-sponsored activities.

The Department of Education must require each application for federal assistance submitted by an educational agency to attest that all of its schools have rescinded any face mask mandate.</summary>
