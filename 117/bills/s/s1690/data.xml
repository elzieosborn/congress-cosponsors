This bill provides additional funding to the Small Business Administration (SBA) for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was established to assist small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 processing loan applications that were submitted on or before May 4, 2021; and providing guaranteed loans to eligible entities that apply on or before May 31, 2021, have no more than 100 employees, and are located in a state with an unemployment rate of at least 6%. In guaranteeing the new loans, the SBA must give a preference to entities that are women-, minority-, or veteran-owned.</summary>
