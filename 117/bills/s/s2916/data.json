This includes data relating to the risks of individual properties, loss ratio information, and current and historical policy and claims information.\n\nTo accomplish this, FEMA must establish an open source data system through which all such information may be electronically accessed by the public. Further, FEMA must establish a public database that provides information regarding each community participating in the program."
