This bill addresses pay equity for amateur athletes and other personnel. It allows recognition, or continued recognition, of a national governing body of an amateur sports organization only if it provides equal investment, promotional support, working conditions (including staff support and facilities and equipment for training and competition), and wages and other compensation to all amateur athletes, without discrimination based on sex.

National governing bodies must report periodically to Congress regarding pay equity.

Each report shall include (1) the median compensation for amateur athletes, coaches, trainers, managers, administrators, and officials, disaggregated by race, gender, and employment category; and (2) the minimum and maximum compensation paid to such personnel, disaggregated by race, gender, and employment category.</summary>
