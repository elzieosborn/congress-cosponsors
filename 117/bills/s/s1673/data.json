    "text": "30 x 30 Termination Act\n\nThis bill prohibits federal acquisition of land or declaration of a national monument in certain areas and nullifies a provision of an executive order related to conservation.\n\nIn a state or county where 15% or more of the land is managed by a federal agency (1) federal funds may not be used to acquire nonfederal land unless the agency proposing the acquisition disposes of an equal amount of federal land within the state or county, and (2) a declaration of a national monument shall not apply.\n\nThe bill prohibits from having the force and effect of law a provision of Executive Order 14008 (86 Fed. Reg. 7619), titled Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, that requires the Department of the Interior to recommend steps to achieve the goal of conserving at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. No federal funds may be used to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out any report or program substantially similar to the report or program of such provision.\n\nNo federal funds may be used to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out any action on federal land that results in a net-loss of multiple use or any principal or major use, unless such action has been authorized by an act of Congress.\n\nNo federal funds may be used by a federal agency to acquire more than 160 acres of nonfederal land unless\n\n the federal agency has received written notice from the state in which the nonfederal land is located that the state has enacted legislation approving the proposed acquisition, and the proposed acquisition has been authorized by an act of Congress."
