This bill requires original manufacturers of electronics-enabled agricultural equipment to provide (on fair and reasonable terms) owners or independent repair shops with the documentation, parts, software, and tools needed to diagnose, maintain, or repair such equipment.

If an original manufacturer stops providing required items, any related copyrights or patents held by that manufacturer shall be placed in the public domain. Furthermore, the bill allows individuals, in specified circumstances, to circumvent copyright protections to facilitate diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of electronics-enabled agricultural equipment.

The bill provides for enforcement through the Federal Trade Commission.</summary>
