    "text": "This bill excludes certain persons from being considered a broker for tax reporting purposes. Under current law, the transfer of digital assets from a broker to a nonbroker requires the broker to file a return beginning on January 1, 2024. The bill provides that a broker does not include any person solely engaged in the business of (1) validating distributed ledger transactions, (2) selling hardware or software for which the sole function is to permit access to digital assets on a distributed ledger, or (3) developing digital assets or protocols for use by other persons who are not customers."
