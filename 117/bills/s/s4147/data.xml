This bill prohibits the Department of Labor from limiting the type or range of investments that fiduciaries may offer participants and beneficiaries in certain employer-sponsored retirement plans. The bill applies to certain defined contribution plans that permit participants or beneficiaries to exercise control over the assets in the account, such as a 401(k) plan that allows participants or beneficiaries to select additional investment options through a self-directed brokerage window.</summary>
