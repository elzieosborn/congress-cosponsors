This bill revises certain bankruptcy requirements, including by providing additional protections for employee pay and pensions in the event of a bankruptcy.

Specifically, the bill

 revises the bankruptcy priority requirements of claims for wages and contributions to employee benefit plans, including by increasing the cap of these payments and by eliminating the time period limitation for which unpaid wages and contributions may be claimed; increases the bankruptcy priority of minimum funding contributions towards employee pension benefit plans and withdrawal liability and requires companies to continue making these payments during bankruptcy; expands restrictions on executive pay; places restrictions on the sale of property in bankruptcy proceedings, including by requiring reasonable payment; and extends look back periods regarding fraudulent transfers from two years to six years.</summary>
