HHS must develop a plan to conduct follow-up outreach to users of the portal (if the user consents to the outreach). States must recommend resources that meet criteria set by HHS for including through the portal. HHS may award grants to states to establish or support a system that aggregates resources to include on the portal.\n\nFurther, the Health Resources and Services Administration must share information about life.gov and the portal through the Maternal Mental Health Hotline.\n\nHHS must also ensure that the life.gov website and hotline are available to families who speak languages other than English.\n\nThe bill excludes from life.gov, the portal, and the hotline resources provided by entities that (1) perform, induce, refer for, or counsel in favor of abortions; or (2) financially support such entities.\n\nThe bill also requires HHS to report on traffic to life.gov and the portal, gaps in services available to pregnant and postpartum individuals, and related matters."
