    "text": "Junk Plan Accountability and Disclosure Act of 2021 This bill establishes requirements for certain noncomprehensive health insurance coverage and provides for additional outreach activities to increase enrollment in qualified health plans.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits online advertisements for health insurance coverage that reasonably mislead an individual (1) to believe that the advertisement is on behalf of a government entity such as a state or federal health insurance exchange, or (2) about the cost or benefits of noncomprehensive coverage (e.g., short-term, limited-duration insurance) compared to a qualified health plan under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The bill provides authority for the Federal Trade Commission to enforce these prohibitions. The bill also requires certain types of coverage (e.g., coverage for nontraditional benefits or student health insurance coverage) to provide consumers with a clear statement indicating the benefits the coverage provides and that the coverage is not a comprehensive health plan. These plans also must meet specified reporting requirements.\n\nIn states with a federally administered exchange, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must conduct outreach and educational activities to individuals about the availability of qualified health plans through the exchange. The bill also provides grants for states to conduct open enrollment outreach with respect to qualified health plans and to explore solutions to promote greater enrollment. The bill provides funding for these outreach activities."
