This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to exempt projects that replace or make improvements to communications facilities&#160;following a presidentially declared &#160;major disaster or emergency from certain environmental or historic preservation review requirements.

Specifically, the bill exempts such projects from&#160;any requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. Such projects are also exempt from considerations about the effect they will have on any historic property.</summary>
