Local consortia refers to partnerships between teacher preparation programs, local educational agencies or individual schools, and community-based organizations.\n\nGrant recipients may use these funds for certain activities, including matching and placing tutors, purchasing instructional materials and connectivity resources, and providing transportation and meals to students who attend the tutoring program.\n\nFurther, ED must enter into an interagency agreement with the Corporation for National and Community Service to include tutor positions as approved national service positions.\n\nFinally, the bill allows tutoring to count toward service requirements for the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program."
