This bill imposes various requirements on dietary supplements, including by requiring the person (an individual or entity) responsible for introducing a supplement into interstate commerce to register the supplement with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Under this bill, the responsible person must register with the FDA specified information about each dietary supplement to be offered for sale, including (1) a list of all ingredients required by regulation to appear on the label; (2) the conditions of use; (3) any warnings and precautions; (4) certain claims characterizing the relationship between certain nutrients in the supplement and a disease or a health-related condition; (5) the responsible person's contact information; and (6) the locations where the supplement is manufactured, packaged, labeled, or held.

For a supplement that is offered for sale on the date that is 18 months after this bill's enactment (the effective date), the responsible person must submit the required information to the FDA no later than 60 days after the effective date. A supplement that is not offered for sale on the effective date may not be offered for sale until the responsible person has submitted the required information.

The FDA must establish a system that provides a unique identifier for each registered dietary supplement and a publicly accessible electronic database that allows a user to obtain certain information about a registered supplement.</summary>
