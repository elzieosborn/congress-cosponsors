    "text": "PFAS Intergovernmental Coordination Act\n\nThis bill directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a working group to address contamination by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS. These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.\n\nSpecifically, the working group shall facilitate more effective cooperation, coordination, and mutual accountability among the federal government and state, local, and tribal governments on a holistic response to PFAS contamination in communities across the United States.\n\nThe working group shall terminate two years after its establishment.\n\nThe OMB must report to Congress, describing any guidelines created in performing its duties and making a recommendation with respect to extending the working group's authorization."
