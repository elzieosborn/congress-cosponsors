  <summary date="2022-03-28T16:25:57Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill extends until September 30, 2022, the effective date for a statutory provision that prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from recognizing a state department or agency as the State Approving Agency (SAA) if the department or agency is administered at or colocated with a university or university system that offers courses or programs of education that are subject to approval by the SAA for that state. (Generally, a SAA is responsible for reviewing, evaluating, and approving courses and programs of education for veterans using their VA education benefits.)</summary>
