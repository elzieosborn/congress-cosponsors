  <summary date="2023-09-14T17:40:28Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Immigration Parole Reform Act of 2022

This bill limits the authority of the Department of Homeland Security to grant immigration parole (i.e., give official permission for an individual to enter and temporarily remain in the United States).

For example, this bill (1) limits what qualifies as an urgent humanitarian reason or a significant public benefit that would justify granting parole, and (2) prohibits granting parole based on an individual's membership in a defined class of individuals.</summary>
