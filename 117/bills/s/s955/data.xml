This bill directs the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to jointly (1) provide recommendations for reducing the number of collisions at highway-rail grade crossings in counties with 10 or fewer residents per square mile; and (2) conduct a public outreach and educational initiative, in cooperation with Operation Lifesaver, to reduce collisions at public highway-rail grade crossings in such counties that includes multimedia resources.

The FRA and the FHWA must use the recommendations to provide technical assistance to states seeking to make rail safety infrastructure improvements.

Additionally, the Department of Transportation must use amounts set aside under the consolidated rail infrastructure and safety improvements grant program to improve grade crossing safety in counties with 10 or fewer residents per square mile.</summary>
