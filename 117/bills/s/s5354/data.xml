This bill establishes an interagency policy council that is focused on matters pertaining to One Health and national security. One Health refers to a multisectoral and transdisciplinary approach for achieving optimal health outcomes for people, domestic and wild animals, plants, and their shared environments and ecosystems.

Specifically, the council must advise the President about, develop a strategy for, and generally coordinate federal activities related to One Health Security (i.e., the operational and functional security of the United States against naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate biological threats, including identified threats, criminal acts, terrorist acts, supply chain failure and system failure, cyberattacks, or other relevant threats affecting One Health and national security).</summary>
