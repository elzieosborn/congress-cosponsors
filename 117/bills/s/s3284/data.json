Specifically, the help line is for veterans, persons acting on behalf of veterans, or individuals who are eligible to receive benefits or services from the VA.\n\nThe VA, in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), may contract with a third party to direct calls to the appropriate person regarding a VA service or benefit.\n\nAdditionally, the VA must coordinate with the FCC to study and report on the feasibility and advisability of designating a covered dialing code for the purpose of reaching the help line."
