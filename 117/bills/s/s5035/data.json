In the case of an individual or household that does not have documented ownership rights in the predisaster primary residence, FEMA must consider evidence of constructive ownership.\n\nFEMA shall create and distribute a declarative form statement that applicants for assistance can use to self-certify eligibility for assistance and shall make the statement available in specified languages at all active Disaster Recovery Centers and on its website and social media.\n\nFEMA shall conduct an analysis comparing the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of assistance provided under the Disaster Housing Assistance Program with other temporary housing options provided by FEMA.\n\nFEMA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development must consult regarding the implementation of a disaster housing assistance program or similar joint program."
