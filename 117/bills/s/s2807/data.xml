This bill provides funding for the Department of the Interior, in coordination with the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, to establish a total of not less than two and not more than five watershed pilot programs that use pay-for-performance contracts.

Interior shall designate a management team for each watershed pilot. The management team for the applicable watershed pilot shall develop and implement a five-year plan for carrying out that pilot.

Interior and the management team for each watershed pilot shall use advance watershed analytics throughout the planning, implementation, measuring, and monitoring of projects within the pilot. Such analytics must be conducted to identify quantifiable outcomes, costs, feasibility, and impacts of the projects before making funding available for the pilot.

Interior and the management team for a watershed pilot shall set and publish minimum per-unit outcome prices. The participating federal department or agency shall enter into a pay-for-performance contract to achieve outcome-based goals described in the plan developed for the pilot.

Interior shall submit specified annual and five-year reports to Congress.</summary>
