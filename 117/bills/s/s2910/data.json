Generally, this exclusivity period begins upon a first applicant's commercial marketing of the drug.\n\nThe bill authorizes the FDA to approve a subsequent generic drug application prior to a first applicant's first date of commercial marketing if (1) the subsequent application is ready for full approval, (2) a first applicant's application has been pending for at least 30 months, (3) the approval of a first applicant's application is not precluded by patent infringement claims asserted against that first applicant, and (4) no first applicant's application has been effectively approved on the date that all such conditions are met."
