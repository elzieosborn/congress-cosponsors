This bill directs several agencies to undertake specified activities and expand surveillance related to cardiac conditions, concussions, and heat-related illnesses among young athletes. The bill also establishes requirements for schools with respect to concussions and excessive heat.

Specifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must (1) develop information for schools, childcare centers, and others on high-risk cardiac conditions in children, adolescents, and young adults; and (2) incorporate questions about cardiac conditions in an existing&#160;school-based health survey.

In addition, the CDC must develop guidelines for emergency action plans for youth athletics programs,&#160;and the Food and Drug Administration may issue guidelines related to youth consumption of&#160;energy drinks.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must award matching grants to local educational agencies for automated external defibrillator and cardiopulmonary resuscitation trainings.

The Department of Education, in consultation with HHS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, must&#160;develop public education materials focused on the health risks of exposure to extreme heat and humidity, and public schools must develop action plans for athletic activities during periods of excessive heat or humidity.

The bill establishes minimum requirements for elementary and secondary schools related to concussions, including but not limited to (1) implementing a standard plan for concussion safety and management, and (2) ensuring students returning to academics after a concussion receive certain services and supports.</summary>
