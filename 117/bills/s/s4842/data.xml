This bill modifies requirements related to U.S. Merchant Marine credentials for veterans and members of the uniformed services.

Specifically, the bill requires the U.S. Coast Guard to

 review and examine all current procedures for issuing credentials for applicants who are veterans and members of the uniformed services seeking to become merchant mariners; provide the availability for a fully internet-based application process for a merchant mariner credential; issue new regulations to reduce the paperwork, delay, and other burdens for applicants for a merchant mariner credential who are veterans and members of the uniformed services and increase the percentages of time equivalent to sea service for such applicants; reduce burdens and create a means of alternative compliance to demonstrate instructor competency for Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers courses; and assess the use of the SkillBridge program of the Department of Defense as a means for transitioning active duty sea service personnel toward employment as a merchant mariner.</summary>
