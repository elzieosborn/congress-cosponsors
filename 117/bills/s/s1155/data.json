The bill also establishes a grant program to support the implementation of extreme risk protection order laws.\n\nAmong its provisions, the bill\n\n establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties (i.e., unlicensed individuals); generally prohibits an unlicensed person from purchasing more than one handgun in a 30-day period; establishes a grant program to help states and Indian tribes implement extreme risk protection order laws (i.e., red flag laws); generally requires gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement within 48 hours of discovery; makes it unlawful to recklessly leave a loaded and unsecured firearm in a manner that endangers a minor who is under 14 years of age; and extends firearms-related restrictions on the receipt, possession, shipment, or transportation of firearms and ammunition to persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of stalking and persons who are subject to an extreme risk protection order."
