Interior and USDA must develop plans to mitigate wildfire risk to communities located near the land.\n\nNo new permanent or temporary roads shall be constructed within the recreation areas except as necessary for public safety or to implement the wildfire mitigation plan.\n\n USDA may take measures within such wilderness additions as are necessary to control fire, insects, and disease.\n\nAll federal surface and subsurface land within the recreation areas or the wilderness additions is withdrawn from\n\n entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral leasing, geothermal leasing, or mineral materials. The bill also withdraws identified federally owned lands and interests within the Hunter Creek, Pistol River Headwaters Withdrawal Proposal, or the Rough and Ready and Baldface Creeks Mineral Withdrawal Proposal in Curry County and Josephine County, Oregon, and any land or interest in land located within such withdrawal proposals that is acquired by the federal government."
