This bill establishes an advisory council within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and sets out other efforts to address economic security and trade, as such matters relate to DHS's mission.

Specifically, DHS must establish the DHS Trade and Economic Security Council, comprised of component heads or their designees, to advise on economic security concerns, such as identification of concentrated risks and priorities for protecting the nation's economic security.

Additionally, the bill provides statutory authority for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Trade and Economic Security and specifies its functions and duties. These include, among other responsibilities, coordination of supply chain policy.</summary>
