  <summary date="2022-06-16T21:18:58Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ultrasound Informed Consent Act

This bill requires abortion providers, as a condition of receiving federal funding, to conduct an ultrasound before performing an abortion.

Specifically, before a woman gives informed consent to any part of an abortion, the abortion provider must

 perform an obstetric ultrasound on the pregnant woman; display the ultrasound images and make audible (when present) the heartbeat and related cardiac sounds for the woman to view and hear while simultaneously explaining the ultrasound depiction and the cardiac sounds; provide a complete medical description of the images, including the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, cardiac activity if present and visible, and the presence of external members and internal organs if present and viewable; and provide the woman with a copy of the ultrasound image. Providers are subject to civil actions and penalties for violations.

The bill's ultrasound requirements do not apply in cases where a physical disorder, illness, or injury caused by the pregnancy endangers a woman's life. A woman is also not required to view the ultrasound images; nor may she or the provider be penalized if she declines to do so.</summary>
