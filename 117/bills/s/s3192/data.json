(Currently, such countries receive benefits in regards to defense article transfers, such as the waiver of certain requirements and eligibility for assistance and fee waivers.)\n\nThe State Department must report to Congress on U.S. priorities for building more capable Taiwan security forces and organizations. The State Department and the Department of Defense must jointly report to Congress on an annual basis on Taiwan's enhancement of its self-defense capabilities."
