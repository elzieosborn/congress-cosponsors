Membership in the reserves is contingent on a mutual agreement between the agency and the individual. CISA must submit an implementation plan for congressional review before taking any further action with respect to the reserve. In addition, CISA and the Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report on the reserve, including whether it should be made permanent."
