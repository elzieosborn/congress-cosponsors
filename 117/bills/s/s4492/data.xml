This bill requires various studies and reports on the exposure, hazards, and management of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS. These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.

Specifically, the bill requires the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to conduct a two-phase study and report on the research and development needed to advance human exposure estimation and toxicity hazard estimation of individual or total PFAS.

The bill also requires the NSF and the Environmental Protection Agency to jointly enter into an agreement with NASEM to conduct a study and submit a report on the research and development needed to advance the understanding of the extent and implications of environmental contamination by PFAS, how to manage and treat such contamination, and the development of safe alternatives.

Finally, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy must submit an implementation plan for federal PFAS research, development, and demonstration activities, taking into account the recommendations of the NASEM reports.</summary>
