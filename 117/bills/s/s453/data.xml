  <summary date="2021-04-01T00:27:24Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Children's Health Insurance Program Pandemic Enhancement and Relief Act or the CHIPPER Act

This bill extends through FY2022 the 11.5% increase to the enhanced federal matching rate, also known as the enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), that is otherwise applicable under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), subject to specified conditions. For example, in order to receive the increased FMAP in FY2021 and FY2022, a state must cover, without cost-sharing, testing and treatment for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), including vaccines, specialized equipment, and therapies.</summary>
