Excluded from this definition are securities, interests in physical commodities, and U.S.-backed digital currencies. The commission does not have jurisdiction over digital commodities used solely for the purchase or sale of a good or service.\n\nDigital commodity platforms (including brokers, custodians, dealers, and trading facilities) must register with the commission and comply with risk management and good governance procedures. The bill also sets forth recordkeeping requirements, conflict of interest standards, and other consumer protections."
