Agencies must submit requests for funds to specified congressional committees and the General Services Administration, as appropriate; the receipt of funds is also contingent on specific legislative approval and appropriations for repayments. Agencies must make repayments to the fund at least annually for an agreed-upon term, but for no longer than 15 years."
