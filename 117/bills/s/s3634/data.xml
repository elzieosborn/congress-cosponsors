This bill establishes a point of order that prohibits the Senate from considering legislation that provides discretionary appropriations unless a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report regarding the impact of the legislation on inflation has been submitted for publication in the Congressional Record.

The CBO report must include an analysis of the impact the legislation would have on

 the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, the Employment Cost Index for private industry workers, and the purchasing power of consumers. The point of order may be waived or suspended by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Senate.</summary>
