  <summary date="2022-06-13T21:19:01Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Comprehensive Access to Resources and Education for Long COVID Act or the CARE for Long COVID Act

This bill requires multiple agencies to carry out research and other activities concerning individuals experiencing post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, or PASC, including health disparities related to this condition. PASC refers to persistent, long-term symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19.

First, the bill requires the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund to support a patient registry to collect information on the symptoms, treatments, demographics, and other relevant data of individuals with confirmed or suspected PASC.

Second, the Department of Health and Human Services must, along with relevant agencies (1) conduct or support research on the U.S. health care system's response to long-term symptoms of COVID-19; and (2) develop resources about PASC or other post-viral illnesses, including about their potential impact on rights associated with employment, disability status, and education.

Third, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must disseminate information about the common symptoms, treatment options, and other topics that pertain to PASC and related post-infectious illnesses.

Fourth, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must expand its Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse to collect data on items and services furnished through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program to individuals who experience PASC.

Last, the Administration for Community Living must award grants or contracts to states, health care providers, legal services providers, and other eligible entities for expanding access to legal assistance for individuals with PASC.</summary>
