If the debt limit has been reached and incoming revenue will be insufficient to pay the priority obligations over an upcoming two-week period, the bill requires (1) Treasury to notify Congress of the expected revenue shortfall for the two-week period, and (2) the debt limit to be increased by the amount of the expected shortfall.\n\nIf the incoming revenue exceeds the expected shortfall, the excess revenue must be held in reserve and applied to the following two-week period."
