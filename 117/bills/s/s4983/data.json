    "text": "Bus Integration Dedicated to Improving Resilience, Eliminating Congestion, and Triggering Innovation Over Numerous Applications and Localities Act or the BIDIRECTIONAL Act\n\nThis bill establishes requirements to encourage the deployment of vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-everything technologies and applications that enable bidirectional charging, such as technologies that enable electric vehicles to use their batteries to power the energy grid or homes when they are not being driven. Specifically, the bill requires states to consider measures to promote vehicle-to-grid integration under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act.\n\nThe bill also directs the Department of Energy to establish a grant program for projects that use at least one electric school bus with such technology. Grants may be awarded to electric energy suppliers, state public utility commissions, school bus manufacturers, school districts, suppliers of charging infrastructure, renewable energy developers, and other eligible entities."
