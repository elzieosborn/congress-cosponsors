This bill addresses the funding, pay, and duties of the Coast Guard.

During a funding gap, the Department of the Treasury shall make available to the Department of Homeland Security such amounts necessary to continue to provide, without interruption, pay and allowances to members of the Coast Guard, including its reserve components, who perform active service during the funding gap.

The Coast Guard must conduct an updated fleet mix analysis that provides for a fleet mix sufficient to carry out the missions of the Coast Guard and to address national security threats.

The Coast Guard must develop an updated shore infrastructure investment plan that includes the construction of additional facilities to accommodate the updated fleet mix and improvements to ensure existing facilities meet requirements and remain operational for the lifespan of such fleet mix.

The Cost Guard shall establish a program to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the enlisted ranks of the Coast Guard.</summary>
