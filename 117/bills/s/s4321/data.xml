This bill revises provisions governing the administration of the Marine Debris Foundation and the Marine Debris Program.

Specifically, the bill allows the foundation to use appropriated funds for employee salaries for the two years following the bill's enactment. The bill also allows the foundation to locate its principal office outside of the District of Columbia and encourages the foundation to locate it in a coastal state.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) may enter into other agreements, outside of contracts, under the Marine Debris Program. NOAA may also make in-kind contributions for projects under the program.</summary>
