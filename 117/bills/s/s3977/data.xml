  <summary date="2022-09-12T21:07:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">SEC Whistleblower Reform Act of 2022 

This bill expands and revises whistleblower protections applicable to individuals who provide information to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to a violation of securities laws.

The prohibition of retaliation against whistleblowers is expanded to include individuals who provide information regarding potential violations to supervisors or other employees in positions of authority.

Additionally, the bill establishes the right to a jury trial for a person accused of violating whistleblower protection laws.

The bill also requires the SEC to make an initial disposition of a whistleblower award claim within the later of (1) one year of the deadline to submit such a claim, or (2) one year after the final resolution of any litigation in the matter.

Finally, the bill deems as unenforceable a predispute arbitration agreement regarding a whistleblower action.</summary>
