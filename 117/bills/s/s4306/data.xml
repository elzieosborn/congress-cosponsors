This bill reauthorizes through FY2027 and expands a program that supports mental and behavioral health education and training for health care providers.

Specifically, the bill expands the program by establishing grants for primary care practices to hire behavioral health providers or otherwise facilitate the adoption of models to integrate behavioral health and primary care. The Department of Health and Human Services must develop reporting requirements and metrics to measure the uptake of such models by primary care practices.</summary>
