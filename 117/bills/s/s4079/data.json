SDRs may be exchanged between member countries and may also be exchanged for currencies.\n\nTreasury must also (1) vigorously advocate for IMF member countries to prohibit transactions involving the exchange of SDRs held by Russia or Belarus, and (2) direct U.S. representatives to the IMF to oppose any allocation of SDRs to Russia or Belarus.\n\nThe bill's provisions shall be in effect until the earlier of (1) five years after this bill's enactment, (2) 30 days after the President reports to Congress that the governments of Russia and Belarus have ceased aggression directed at undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, or (3) the date on which the President reports to Congress that termination of the provisions is in the national interest of the United States."
