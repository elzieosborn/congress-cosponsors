This bill prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) from procuring or purchasing specified items (e.g., cleaning products) containing a perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substance, commonly referred to as PFAS. These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.

DOD may not authorize the sale of any specified item containing PFAS on DOD property, such as commissaries or online exchange shops.</summary>
