This bill temporarily prohibits an executive agency from entering into a contract for the procurement of goods or services with any person that it determines, with the concurrence of the Department of State, knowingly engages in significant business operations with the Maduro regime in Venezuela.

The bill lists exceptions, including where vital to U.S. national security or as necessary for purposes of providing humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and other urgent lifesaving measures, or to carry out noncombatant evacuations.

The prohibition shall not apply to contracts that support U.S. government activities in Venezuela or to contracts with international organizations.

The State Department may waive the requirements of this bill upon determining that to do so is in the national interest.</summary>
