This bill supports specified research and development activities of the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science.

The bill establishes various programs, including

 a basic energy sciences research and development program; a Carbon Oxide Sequestration Research and Geologic Computing Initiative; a biological systems science and climate and environmental science research and development program; earth and environmental systems science research; a coastal zone research initiative; a Quantum User Expansion for Science and Technology program or QUEST program; a research program on the fundamental constituents of matter and energy and the nature of space and time; research activities on the nature of the primary contents of the universe, including the nature of dark energy and dark matter; a research program to discover and understand various forms of nuclear matter; a high intensity laser research initiative; and an Emerging Biological Threat Preparedness Research Initiative. The DOE Office of Science shall continue to leverage U.S. participation in the Large Hadron Collider and prioritize expanding international partnerships and investments in the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment.

DOE shall broaden its recruitment pool to increase participation from underrepresented institutions of higher education, including historically Black colleges and universities.
