This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a Federal Clearinghouse on Safety and Security Best Practices for Faith-Based Organizations and Houses of Worship.

The clearinghouse shall be the primary resource of the federal government to (1) educate and publish online best practices and recommendations for safety and security for faith-based organizations and houses of worship, and (2) provide information relating to federal grant programs available to faith-based organizations and houses of worship.

DHS shall develop tiers for determining evidence-based practices that demonstrate a significant effect on improving safety, security, or both for faith-based organizations and houses of worship.

The clearinghouse website shall include a separate section for other resources that shall provide a centralized list of all available points of contact to seek assistance in grant applications and in carrying out the best practices and recommendations of the clearinghouse.</summary>
