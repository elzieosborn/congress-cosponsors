    "text": "This bill prohibits federal agencies from proposing, implementing, or finalizing a rule or guidance that bans hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) in the United States. Hydraulic fracturing means a process that (1) stimulates or increases the production and recovery of oil or natural gas from a well by pumping a fluid and a propping agent (e.g., sand) at high pressure into a well to create fractures in the reservoir that the propping agent holds open, and (2) increases the surface of the formation available for oil and natural gas to flow into the well."
