This bill establishes a grant program to assist certain institutions of higher education with setting up a program that prepares minority students to participate in the telecommunications workforce.

 Specifically, the bill requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, acting through the Office of Minority Broadband Initiatives, to establish the Telecommunications Workforce Training Grant Program. This grant program shall provide funds to historically Black colleges or universities, tribal colleges or universities, or minority-serving institutions to facilitate the creation of programs that (1) educate and train students to participate in the telecommunications workforce, and (2) include both a curriculum and apprenticeship or internship opportunities.</summary>
