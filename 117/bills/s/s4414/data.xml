This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to publish a list of hospitals that are not in compliance with the hospital price transparency rule, which requires hospitals to provide clear, accessible pricing information online about the items and services they provide. The list must include any hospitals that have received a written communication from the CMS about potential noncompliance.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to report on compliance and enforcement of the price transparency rule, including recommendations for improving price transparency to patients, employers, and the public.</summary>
