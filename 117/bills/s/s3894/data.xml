This bill establishes programs for continuously diagnosing and mitigating cyber threats to and vulnerabilities of government entities.

Specifically, the bill provides statutory authority for a continuous diagnostic and mitigation program maintained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that assists federal agencies to address cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The bill further requires that CISA maintain this program with or without reimbursement from other agencies.

In addition, the Department of Homeland Security must develop a strategy to implement CISA's program and carry out a pilot program to promote the use of tools developed as part of the program in state, tribal, territorial, and local governments.</summary>
