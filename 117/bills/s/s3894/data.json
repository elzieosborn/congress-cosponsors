The bill further requires that CISA maintain this program with or without reimbursement from other agencies.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Homeland Security must develop a strategy to implement CISA's program and carry out a pilot program to promote the use of tools developed as part of the program in state, tribal, territorial, and local governments."
