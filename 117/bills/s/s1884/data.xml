  <summary date="2021-07-07T15:59:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Broadband Parity Act of 2021

This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish a minimum level of service (e.g., upload and download speeds) that any fixed broadband internet service provider must offer to be eligible for assistance under a federal broadband support program. This minimum must ensure that a provider can support virtual learning, telehealth services, and telework.

Further, the bill prohibits an agency from assisting a provider through a federal broadband support program unless the service that will be assisted meets or exceeds (or will meet or exceed when deployed) this minimum level of service.</summary>
