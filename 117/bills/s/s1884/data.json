This minimum must ensure that a provider can support virtual learning, telehealth services, and telework.\n\nFurther, the bill prohibits an agency from assisting a provider through a federal broadband support program unless the service that will be assisted meets or exceeds (or will meet or exceed when deployed) this minimum level of service."
