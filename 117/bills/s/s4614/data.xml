This bill provides for the&#160;use of trauma-informed practices in public elementary and secondary schools and allows states to use certain federal funds to train teachers and other staff in such practices.

The bill defines trauma-informed practices to include

 evidence-based professional development that promotes a shared understanding among teachers and other staff that adverse and potentially traumatic experiences are common among students and that school-wide learning environments where all students and adults feel safe, welcomed, and supported can enable students to succeed despite such experiences; adoption of disciplinary procedures and practices that utilize evidence-based restorative practices that build a culture of trust; and activities that engage teachers, other staff, and families in a process of school-based planning to help all students feel safe and connected to the school community.</summary>
