This bill extends through FY2036 the reclamation fee that each operator of a coal mining operation must pay to the Department of the Interior for the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.

Under the existing Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program, Interior collects a fee from coal mining companies for each ton of coal produced. The fees are deposited into the fund, which may be used to address hazards to public health, safety, and the environment from coal mining sites that were abandoned or unreclaimed as of August 3, 1977. Interior's authority to collect the fee expires on September 30, 2021.</summary>
