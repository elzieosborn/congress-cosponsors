The tax does not apply to a repurchase made after 2025 or that is treated as dividend. It also does not apply if the total value of the stock repurchased during a taxable year does not exceed $1 million.\n\nThe bill disqualifies certain large oil and natural gas companies from the use of the LIFO (last-in first-out) inventory accounting method."
