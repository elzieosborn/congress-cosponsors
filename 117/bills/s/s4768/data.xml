  <summary date="2022-08-24T18:15:07Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Taxing Big Oil Profiteers Act 

This bill imposes an additional 21% tax through 2025 on the excess profits (i.e., current profits over normal return) of oil and natural gas companies that have average annual gross receipts during a three-year period of over $1 billion.

The bill imposes on publicly-traded domestic corporations a tax equal to 25% of the fair market value of the stock of the corporation repurchased during the taxable year. The tax does not apply to a repurchase made after 2025 or that is treated as dividend. It also does not apply if the total value of the stock repurchased during a taxable year does not exceed $1 million.

The bill disqualifies certain large oil and natural gas companies from the use of the LIFO (last-in first-out) inventory accounting method.</summary>
