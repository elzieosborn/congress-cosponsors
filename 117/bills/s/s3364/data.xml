This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for a study on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) transmission in schools and day cares. In particular, the study must evaluate the impact of RSV on the economy, including through parents' absences from work.

RSV is a common respiratory virus that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms although it may be more serious for infants, older adults, and other vulnerable populations.</summary>
