  <summary date="2022-06-24T14:45:19Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill establishes a pilot program to facilitate community involvement in transportation planning by supporting partnerships between one or more transportation planning agencies (e.g., local and regional metropolitan planning organizations) and community-based organizations.

To carry out the program, the Department of Transportation must award grants to such partnerships for, among other purposes, facilitating public meetings and stipends to cover expenses of community participants related to their engagement in transportation planning processes.</summary>
