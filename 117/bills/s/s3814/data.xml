  <summary date="2022-06-17T17:24:16Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Modernizing Biosurveillance Capabilities and Epidemic Forecasting Act

This bill makes changes to various biosurveillance activities and infectious disease outbreak analysis capabilities.

These changes include expanding reporting requirements and otherwise modifying the scope of biosurveillance activities with a specific focus on improving the integration of other sources of data (e.g., laboratory results) into applicable surveillance systems.

The bill also requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to continue developing infectious disease outbreak analysis capabilities to respond to public health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks. In particular, the CDC must identify strategies to leverage the capabilities of public and private entities, including through collaborative partnerships. The CDC must report annually for five years on its efforts.</summary>
