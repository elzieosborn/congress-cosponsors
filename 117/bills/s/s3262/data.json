The bill also requires a study on best practices for operating a chassis pool to optimize supply chains.\n\nIn addition, the bill modifies duties and authorities of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), including by\n\n providing statutory authority for an office that offers mediation and related services to resolve issues under the FMC's jurisdiction; and authorizing the FMC to expand data-sharing between port operators, shippers, and other stakeholders to facilitate efficient freight operations if the FMC determines port congestion constitutes an emergency."
