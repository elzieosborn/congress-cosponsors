This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to carry out a pilot program to make grants to local governments to (1) enhance the production of maps relating to urban flooding and associated property damage; and (2) increase the availability of such maps to homeowners, businesses, and localities to enable them to minimize urban flooding risk.
