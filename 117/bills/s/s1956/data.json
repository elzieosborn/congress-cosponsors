Only projects that have been recommended in energy assessments are eligible for grants.\n\nThe bill also authorizes Industrial Assessment Centers to provide technical assistance to small- and medium-sized manufacturers that have completed energy assessments to upgrade, retrofit, or replace systems or infrastructure."
