The President may also liquidate the confiscated property and use the resulting funds to provide assistance to Ukraine.\n\nSpecifically, upon a declaration of a national emergency relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the President may confiscate the property of such a person if (1) the property is valued at more than $2 million; and (2) the person is subject to U.S. sanctions relating to corruption, human rights violations, Russia's malign influence, or conflicts in Ukraine."
