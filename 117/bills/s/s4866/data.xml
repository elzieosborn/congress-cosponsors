This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants for establishing sickle cell disease treatment centers that operate using a hub-and-spoke framework to provide integrated, longitudinal health care for patients with the disease and individuals with sickle cell trait. Grant recipients must be networks comprised of (1) a hospital, clinic, or university health center; (2) at least one federally qualified health center or other health care organization that incorporates community health workers into the care team; and (3) at least one community-based organization.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that can lead to pain, anemia, infections, and stroke.</summary>
