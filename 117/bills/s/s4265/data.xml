This bill modifies provisions relating to qualified tuition programs (i.e., tax-exempt 529 plans). Specifically, it increases from $10,000 to $12,000 the limitation under such programs on payments for educational expenses, including expenses for tuition in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school. The bill provides for an annual inflation adjustment to the increased limitation amount for taxable years beginning after 2022.</summary>
