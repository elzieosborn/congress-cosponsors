This bill revises the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) of the Farm Service Agency. The CRP is a land conservation program that provides an annual rental payment to farmers in exchange for farmers removing environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and planting species that will improve environmental health and quality.

Specifically, the bill

 establishes a continuous enrollment procedure for the conservation reserve of land that will be enrolled under the state acres for wildlife enhancement initiative; provides federal cost sharing payments for the establishment of grazing infrastructure on all CRP contracts and practices, if grazing is included in the conservation plan and addresses a resource concern; and increases the CRP annual rental payment limitation from $50,000 to $125,000.</summary>
