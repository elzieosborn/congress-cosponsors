  <summary date="2022-04-06T19:24:31Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Disability Access to Transportation Act

This bill expands transportation access for individuals with disabilities.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Transportation to

 establish a one-stop paratransit pilot program to develop or expand paratransit programs carried out pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to prevent long wait times between multiple trips that unduly limit an individual's ability to complete essential tasks; issue regulations enforcing guidelines that set forth minimum standards for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way, including shared use paths; implement procedures that allow an individual to submit an ADA complaint by phone, by mail-in form, and online; require each public transit provider and contractor providing paratransit services to post certain information for how an individual can file a disability-related complaint; file yearly reports of accessibility complaints; and create an accessibility data pilot program to assist states and metropolitan or rural planning organizations to improve their transportation planning.</summary>
