By January 1, 2026, such programs may not purchase a drug with any active ingredients from China. The Department of Health and Human Services may issue a waiver for an agency or program that is unable to meet this requirement, but no waiver may apply to drugs purchased in or after 2027.\n\nEach drug must have labeling listing the country of origin of each active ingredient, and a drug without this labeling shall be deemed misbranded."
