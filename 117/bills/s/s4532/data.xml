This bill expands the factors allowed to be considered by a supervising agency when evaluating a financial institution's compliance with community reinvestment standards. Specifically, the bill allows a supervising agency to consider the efforts of a financial institution that deny business loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers to refer these borrowers to community business development organizations or to provide these borrowers directly with business development resources.</summary>
