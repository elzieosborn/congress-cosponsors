This bill permits certain women-owned small businesses to retain for seven years their certification under the Small Business Administration's Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting program even if the ownership interests in the small business are held by a licensed small business investment company that would otherwise reduce the ownership percentage below the threshold required for participation in the WOSB program.</summary>
