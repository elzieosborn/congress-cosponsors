This bill modifies the tax treatment of foreign source income of domestic corporations to (1) eliminate a provision that allows companies to deduct a portion of the tangible assets of their controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) before the tax on foreign income applies, and (2) require net CFC tested income to be determined on a country-by-country basis rather than globally.

The bill also requires the Joint Committee on Taxation to study options for reforming laws related to the taxation of income from international sources.</summary>
