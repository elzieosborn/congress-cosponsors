This bill revises the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation (TIFIA) program to (1) require program applicants to obtain investment grade ratings from at least two credit rating agencies, unless the federal credit instrument is less than $150 million (currently, less than $75 million), in which case one rating will suffice; (2) require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement an expedited decision time line for public agency borrowers seeking secured loans; and (3) require DOT to publish status reports on program applications on the TIFIA website.</summary>
