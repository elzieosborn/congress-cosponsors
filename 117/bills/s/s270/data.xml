This bill redesignates the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site as the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park and expands the park.

The park is expanded to include the land and interests in land as generally depicted on the map titled Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park Boundary Additions and Affiliated Areas, and dated February 2022, and more particularly described as

 the Summerton High School site in Summerton, South Carolina; the former Scott's Branch High School site in Summerton; and approximately one acre of land adjacent to Monroe Elementary School in Topeka, Kansas. The Department of the Interior may acquire this land by donation, exchange, or purchase. Any property owned by South Carolina, Kansas, or any political subdivision of those states may be acquired by donation.

Interior shall submit to Congress an amendment to the management plan for the historical park to include the portions of the historical park in Summerton.

The bill establishes as affiliated areas of the National Park System

 the Robert Russa Moton Museum in Farmville, Virginia; the Delaware Brown v. Board of Education civil rights sites, including Claymont High School in Claymont, Delaware; and the John Philip Sousa Middle School in the District of Columbia. Interior shall develop a management plan for each affiliated area.</summary>
