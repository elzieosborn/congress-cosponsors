This bill establishes the 2020 Census Federal Advisory Committee on Transparency and Standards to review 2020 Census operations and decision-making in order to make policy and legislative recommendations, assess how decisions concerning the census affected the quality and accuracy of the enumeration of the people of the United States, and consider factors related to the census that may have dampened participation in self-response.

For purposes of adopting congressional district boundaries, the legislature of a state or any entity charged by a state with recommending or adopting such boundaries shall make its recommendations or determinations using total population data counting the whole number of persons in the state.</summary>
