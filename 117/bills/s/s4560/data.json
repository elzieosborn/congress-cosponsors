Specifically, the plebiscite shall offer eligible voters a choice of four options: independence for Puerto Rico, sovereignty in free association with the United States, statehood, or retaining the status of Puerto Rico as a commonwealth. The bill provides for a runoff plebiscite if no option receives a majority vote in the initial plebiscite.\n\nThe Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections shall carry out a nonpartisan voter education campaign through traditional paid media and make available at all voting locations voter education materials related to the plebiscites.\n\nAll voter educational materials and ballots used to carry out this bill shall be made available in English and Spanish.\n\nThe bill sets forth transition and implementation provisions for each choice offered in the plebiscite."
