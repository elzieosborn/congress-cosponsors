This bill expands the E-Verify program. E-Verify is a web-based system that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States.

Specifically, the bill requires federal contractors, subcontractors, grantees, and assistance recipients to enroll in the E-Verify program and maintain compliance with all related statutes, regulations, and policies.

The bill sets forth requirements regarding compliance certification and consideration of past contract performance.

The Office of the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy must report annually on agency compliance with statutes, regulations, and policies regarding the E-Verify program.</summary>
