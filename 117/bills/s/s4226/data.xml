This bill addresses a shortage in the domestic supply of infant formula.

Specifically, the bill directs the President to immediately use existing authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure the supply of infant formula. That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration must (1) establish, within 15 days, a process to allow importation of infant formula from the European Union; and (2) publish safety guidelines for imported infant formula.</summary>
