    "text": "Maximize Americans' Retirement Security Act\n\nThis bill revises the fiduciary duties for a retirement or employee benefit plan that is regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n\nThe bill generally requires a fiduciary to select and maintain investments for a plan based solely on pecuniary factors. Under the bill, a pecuniary factor is a factor that is expected to have a material effect on the risk or return of an investment based on appropriate investment horizons that are consistent with the plan's investment objectives and funding policy.\n\nA fiduciary may only use nonpecuniary factors if the fiduciary is unable to distinguish between investment alternatives on the basis of pecuniary factors alone. In such a case, the fiduciary must provide specified documentation to the plan's participants and beneficiaries, including an explanation of how the chosen nonpecuniary factors are consistent with their interests."
