This bill prohibits federal agencies from requiring the staff of health care facilities or other settings to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

On November 5, 2021, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued a rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination. The rule requires health care providers, as a condition of Medicare and Medicaid participation, to ensure that staff are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.</summary>
