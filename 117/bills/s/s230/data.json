The bill requires facilities to report information concerning any infectious disease outbreak that results in a state or national emergency in accordance with the standards for COVID-19 reporting. It also prohibits the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from reducing the frequency of compliance surveys or waiving direct care staffing reports during such outbreaks.\n\nAdditionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on deficiencies relating to COVID-19 infection control and direct care staffing requirements for skilled nursing facilities."
