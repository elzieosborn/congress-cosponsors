Certain types of drugs may not be imported under this program, such as controlled substances, biological products, or intravenously injected drugs.\n\nAn approved pharmacy under this program must be located and licensed in Canada and meet additional requirements, such as participation in ongoing and comprehensive quality assurance programs.\n\nThe FDA shall publish a list of approved Canadian pharmacies on a website."
