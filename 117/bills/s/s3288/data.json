    "text": "NTIA Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2021\n\nThis bill reauthorizes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) through FY2023 and modifies its duties and responsibilities.\n\nSpecifically, the NTIA must consult with other federal agencies to ensure that matters presented to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are appropriately coordinated and accurately reflect executive branch views and policies. Additionally, the NTIA and the FCC must update a memorandum of understanding that guides planning, dispute resolution, and other processes related to the allocation and management of the electromagnetic spectrum. Further, the NTIA must recommend candidates to lead the U.S. delegation to a conference held to update the international treaty that governs the use of radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbits.\n\nThe bill also (1) expands the NTIA's policy objectives to encompass fostering the digital economy and achieving universal access to telecommunications and information networks, and (2) requires the NTIA to promote telecommunications industry workforce programs (e.g., apprenticeships and other skills training programs)."
