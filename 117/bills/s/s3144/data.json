The Department of the Interior shall develop a comprehensive management plan for the long-term conservation and management of the monument that fulfills such purposes.\n\nInterior shall conduct a wildfire risk assessment of the monument. Interior shall develop, based on the wildfire risk assessment, a wildfire mitigation plan that identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes management activities that can be implemented in the Lower Unit to mitigate wildfire risk to structures and communities located near the monument.\n\nInterior shall develop a comprehensive transportation plan for the monument.\n\nThe bill authorizes the exchange of federal and nonfederal lands involving the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nInterior shall acquire, for approximately equal value, any land and interests in land owned by Oregon within the monument in exchange for\n\n the conveyance of federal land or federal mineral interests that are outside the boundaries of the monument, a payment to Oregon, or a combination of such methods."
