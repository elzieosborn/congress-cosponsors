This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish a pilot program on developing and testing dynamic management of special activity airspace to accommodate emerging military training requirements through flexible scheduling and increase access to special activity airspace used by the Department of Defense (DOD) for test and training.

Under the pilot program, the FAA and DOD must jointly test at least three areas of episodic or permanent special activity airspace designated for use by DOD, including at least two areas over U.S. land and one over U.S. coastal waters.

Any increase in access to airspace made available for test and training shall not conflict with the safe management of the national airspace system or the safety of stakeholders of the system.</summary>
