This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to include new elements in its annual primary prevention research agenda, for example, a focus on whether and to what extent sub-populations of the military community may be targeted for interpersonal violence more than others.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to submit a report to Congress (1) comparing the DOD's sexual harassment and prevention training with similar programs at other federal departments and agencies; and (2) that includes relevant data collected by colleges, universities, and other relevant outside entities on hazing, bullying, and interpersonal and self-directed violence.</summary>
