This bill directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide upon request emergency use authorization for COVID-19 rapid antigen tests approved for use in the European Union.

During the declared COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA shall grant emergency use authorization to a COVID-19 rapid antigen test upon a proper request by the test's manufacturer if (1) the test is on the European Commission Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety's common list for approved COVID-19 tests, and (2) the request is for the non-laboratory use of the test without a prescription.

The bill waives certain requirements for a request for emergency use authorization under this bill, such as a finding from the FDA that the test may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19.

If a test authorized under this bill is removed from the EU common list, the FDA must determine within 30 days of such removal whether the emergency use authorization for the test should continue.</summary>
