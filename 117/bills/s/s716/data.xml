This bill establishes requirements concerning the judicial review of cases about the environmental review process required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).

Specifically, the bill establishes standing requirements for NEPA claims, including a requirement that a plaintiff must personally suffer, or will likely personally suffer, a direct, tangible harm.

In addition, the bill sets a statute of limitations for all claims related to NEPA.

The bill also provides statutory authority for certain evidentiary standards concerning motions for temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions.

In addition, the bill limits fees that may be awarded to environmental attorneys.</summary>
