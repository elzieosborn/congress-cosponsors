The bill defines\n\n new partner as a nonprofit that has not received USAID funding as a prime partner in the past five years, underutilized partner as a nonprofit that has received less than $25 million in direct or indirect awards from the USAID in the past five years, and local partner as a local entity or locally established partner of a U.S.-based nonprofit. The USAID must annually report to Congress on funding awarded to new, underutilized, and local partners."
