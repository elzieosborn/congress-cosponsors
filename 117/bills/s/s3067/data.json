Regarding intelligent transportation systems and technology, DOT must establish an internet-based resource for states and localities to use when developing intelligent transportation and related programs.\n\nDOT must also award grants to improve transportation efficiency and safety through advanced smart city or community technologies and systems. Eligible recipients include states, Indian tribes, localities, public transit agencies, and groups of such entities.\n\nAdditionally, DOT must support workforce development in the intelligent transportation technologies and systems industry. This includes (1) contracting with the National Academies of Sciences to assess workforce needs, (2) establishing a working group to implement a workforce development plan, and (3) increasing public awareness of career opportunities in the transportation sector."
