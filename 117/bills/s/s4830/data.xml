  <summary date="2022-10-31T15:29:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill authorizes the Department of the Interior to take land into trust for all federally recognized Indian tribes.

Specifically, the bill applies the Indian Reorganization Act to all federally recognized Indian tribes, regardless of when a tribe became recognized. The amendments made by this bill are retroactively effective as if included in the Indian Reorganization Act. This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that Interior could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in 1934.</summary>
