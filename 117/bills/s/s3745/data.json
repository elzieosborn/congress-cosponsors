The bill's\u00a0tailoring requirement applies not only to future regulatory actions but also to regulations adopted within the last seven years.\n\nThe bill also reduces certain reporting requirements for banks eligible for the community bank leverage ratio.\n\nFinally, federal banking agencies must report on the modernization of bank supervision, including examiner workforce and training and statutory changes necessary to achieve more effective supervision."
