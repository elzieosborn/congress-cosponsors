Specifically, it prohibits the imposition of such standards or conditions if (1) the production or manufacture occurs in another state, and (2) the standard or condition adds to requirements applicable under federal law and the laws of the state or locality where the product is produced or manufactured.\n\nThe bill also allows for a private right of action to challenge state or local regulations relating to agricultural goods sold in interstate commerce. A person may bring an action in (1) the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the person is affected by a regulation or the person resides, operates, or does business; or (2) any other appropriate court with jurisdiction."
