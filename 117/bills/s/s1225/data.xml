 This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student-aid programs to report on additional information related to intercollegiate athletic programs.

Specifically, the bill requires an IHE that is a member of Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association to include in its annual report (1) the amount of sports-related revenue in specified categories (e.g., ticket sales, student fees, and concessions), disaggregated by each sports team; and (2) the sports-related expenses in specified categories (e.g., salaries and benefits, team travel, and recruiting), disaggregated by each sports team.

In addition, the bill requires the Department of Education to appoint a task force to review definitions related to revenue and expenses.</summary>
