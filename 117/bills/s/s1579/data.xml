This bill establishes a framework to limit the use of riot control agents (e.g., tear gas) by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers.

Specifically, it requires federal law enforcement agencies to maintain policies that (1) permit their use only to stop violent activities, and (2) minimize the impact of their use on those not participating in the violent activity. State and local law enforcement agencies must maintain similar policies and procedures as a condition of receiving funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program and the Community Oriented Policing Services program.</summary>
