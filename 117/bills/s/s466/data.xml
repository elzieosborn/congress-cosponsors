This bill requires a mobile or internet voice service provider to disclose the location information of a device pursuant to certain requests.

Specifically, a provider must disclose this information at the request of an investigative or law enforcement officer (or public safety employee or agent on behalf of such officer) if the officer asserts (1) that the device was used to place a 911 call, or (2) reasonable suspicion that the device is in the possession of an individual who is in an emergency situation. A provider that discloses a device location in response to such a request may not be held liable in legal or administrative proceedings related to the disclosure.</summary>
