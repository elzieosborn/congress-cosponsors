It provides that in losses of any uncut timber from fire, storm, wood-destroying insects or invasive species, severe drought, or from theft, the basis for determining the amount of the deduction for such loss shall not be less than the excess of the appraised value of such timber determined immediately before such loss was sustained, over the salvage value of such timber.\n\nTo be eligible for the casualty loss deduction, the uncut timber subject to the loss must be reforested not later than the close of the five-year period beginning on the date of the loss."
