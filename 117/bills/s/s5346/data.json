    "text": "Brokered Deposit Affiliate-Subsidiary Modernization Act of 2022\n\nThis bill excludes affiliates\u00a0and subsidiaries of an insured depository institution from certain limitations applicable to brokered deposits. (Brokered deposits are a type of deposit accepted by an institution from a third-party deposit broker for investment purposes. Institutions that accept brokered deposits are subject to additional regulatory requirements, including those related to liquidity.)\n\nThe bill also expands the definition of an employee of an insured depository institution, thereby exempting these individuals from treatment as a deposit broker. Specifically, the bill includes as an employee (1) an individual who receives compensation in any form from an insured depository institution or from an affiliate or subsidiary, and (2) a registered representative of a broker or dealer that is an affiliate or subsidiary of an insured depository institution."
