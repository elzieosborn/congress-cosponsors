This bill directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to coordinate with the heads of federal agencies to develop a comprehensive strategic plan for federal electric vehicle fleet battery management and to report to and brief Congress regarding the plan and its implementation across agencies.

The GSA may periodically update the strategic plan based on new information relating to electric vehicle batteries that becomes available.

The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on how the costs and benefits of operating and maintaining electric vehicles in the federal fleet compare to the costs and benefits of operating and maintaining internal combustion engine vehicles.</summary>
