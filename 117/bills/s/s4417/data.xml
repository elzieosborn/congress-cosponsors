This bill modifies the authorities and procedures of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), the body within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) that decides administrative patent validity challenges and reviews (e.g., inter partes reviews and post-grant reviews).

For example, the bill (1) authorizes the director of the PTO to review and set aside PTAB decisions, (2) modifies the time limits for filing such patent validity challenges at the PTAB, and (3) limits the institution of certain such challenges if the challenges are filed by the same petitioner and includes one or more of the same claims.</summary>
