This bill requires the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to maintain a voluntary network of domestic manufacturers that have agreed to produce critical supplies during emergencies and other supply chain disruptions.

As part of maintaining the network, the office must identify critical supplies and share information about the network with state, tribal, and local governments when supply shortfalls are anticipated. In addition, a participating manufacturer must develop a plan that identifies the supplies the manufacturer could produce, its manufacturing capacity, and support it would need to produce the supplies in an emergency.

The bill also requires HHS to issue guidance on applicable quality standards for supplies produced by manufacturers in the network.</summary>
