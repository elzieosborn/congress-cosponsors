In addition, a participating manufacturer must develop a plan that identifies the supplies the manufacturer could produce, its manufacturing capacity, and support it would need to produce the supplies in an emergency.\n\nThe bill also requires HHS to issue guidance on applicable quality standards for supplies produced by manufacturers in the network."
