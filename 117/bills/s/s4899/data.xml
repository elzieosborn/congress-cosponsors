This bill specifies that individuals who elect to receive services in religious nonmedical health care institutions (RNHCIs) may receive COVID-19 vaccines under Medicare.

Specifically, an individual's receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine does not revoke the individual's election to receive services in RNHCIs under Medicare; an individual who's election was revoked due to the receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine prior to the bill's date of enactment may immediately reelect to receive services in RNHCIs under Medicare.</summary>
