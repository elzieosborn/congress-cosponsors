To be eligible, a station must serve a media market with a limited number of television households, broadcast a minimum number of hours, and meet other requirements.\n\nA low-power station with a Class A license obtains certain broadcast rights, including primary status with respect to its allocation of the electromagnetic spectrum. (Typically, low-power stations have secondary status and may be displaced from their spectrum in the event the FCC reallocates it to a primary user.)"
