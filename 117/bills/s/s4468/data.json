In convening the panel, HHS must coordinate with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and other HHS components.\n\nHHS must also establish an interagency council to develop a strategic plan and recommendations to improve diagnosis in health care.\n\nIn addition, AHRQ must (1) establish a quality improvement program related to diagnostic errors that includes dissemination of evidence-based strategies to improve diagnostic quality, safety, and health-care value; and (2) seek to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study disparities in diagnostic safety and quality.\n\nThe bill also allows specified grants provided by AHRQ and by the National Institutes of Health to be used for diagnostic safety and quality research."
