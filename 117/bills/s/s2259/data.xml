  <summary date="2021-10-27T20:48:38Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Resilient Schools Act of 2021

This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to establish the Climate Change Resiliency Program to increase the resiliency of public schools during climate change-related events, natural disasters, and public health crises.

Further, ED must establish a related grant program for state educational agencies to implement climate resiliency plans or projects in public schools. Grant recipients must use these funds for certain activities, such as improvements to school buildings and grounds, green infrastructure projects, and projects to increase food supply resiliency.

Projects that receive a grant must (1) pay all laborers and mechanics locally prevailing wages, and (2) use only certain U.S.-produced construction materials unless a waiver is secured from ED.</summary>
