Grant recipients must use these funds for certain activities, such as improvements to school buildings and grounds, green infrastructure projects, and projects to increase food supply resiliency.\n\nProjects that receive a grant must (1) pay all laborers and mechanics locally prevailing wages, and (2) use only certain U.S.-produced construction materials unless a waiver is secured from ED."
