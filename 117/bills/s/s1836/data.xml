This bill expands the allowable uses of funds available to states for repairing federal-aid highways and other roadways damaged by natural disasters and catastrophic failures.

At the request of the governor and with approval of the Department of Transportation, a state may use funds for emergency maintenance projects (including those considered heavy or routine maintenance) that are necessary due to a natural disaster or catastrophic failure. Additionally, the bill increases the percent of funds a state may use for projects to protect public safety or to maintain or protect roadways from a disaster or catastrophic failure.

The bill also includes within the scope of natural disasters blizzards, ice storms, and wildfires.</summary>
