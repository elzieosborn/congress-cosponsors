This bill expands a variety of Arctic-focused provisions pertaining to national security, shipping, and trade.

For example, the bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish the Arctic Shipping Federal Advisory Committee to advise DOT on matters related to Arctic maritime transportation, including Arctic seaway development. It also requires the Department of the Navy to ensure that the Port of Nome in Alaska is usable for the implementation of the National Strategy for the Arctic Region and military service strategies for the Arctic.

Additionally, the U.S. Coast Guard and Navy must jointly submit to Congress a report that outlines the requirements to establish a persistent, year-round presence of the Navy and Coast Guard in the Arctic region, including at the Port of Nome and any other deepwater port that would facilitate such a presence.

The bill also requires the Committee on Maritime Transportation System to submit to Congress a report that describes the control and influence of the Russian Federation on shipping in the Arctic and includes a plan for eliminating or preventing a Russian monopoly on shipping in the region to enable an increased U.S. presence in the Arctic shipping domain.

Further, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that (1) Arctic countries are important partners of the United States, and (2) the United States International Development Finance Corporation should make investments in Arctic countries to facilitate technologies that contribute to energy security and sustainable opportunities for indigenous groups.</summary>
