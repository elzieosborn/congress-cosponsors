This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to set aside $10 million each fiscal year to provide grants to certain airports and transit operators for human trafficking awareness, education, and prevention efforts.

DOT must give priority in grant amounts to entities that serve regions with a higher prevalence of human trafficking and take into consideration the effect such grants would have on surrounding areas.

Additionally, DOT must consult with its Advisory Committee on Human Trafficking in determining the grant amount each recipient receives.</summary>
