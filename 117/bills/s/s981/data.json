Federal civilian real property generally refers to federal real property assets, including public buildings, occupied and improved grounds, leased space, or other physical structures under the custody and control of a federal agency.\n\nSpecifically, a federal agency must consult with tribal governments prior to the sale or transfer of certain federal civilian real property if the proposed sale or transfer would affect a tribe's access to federal agency services. Further, the bill prohibits the property from being sold or transferred if the sale or transfer would substantially reduce or eliminate a tribe's access to these services."
