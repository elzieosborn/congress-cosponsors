This bill establishes requirements for tribal consultation prior to the sale or transfer of certain federal civilian real property. Federal civilian real property generally refers to federal real property assets, including public buildings, occupied and improved grounds, leased space, or other physical structures under the custody and control of a federal agency.

Specifically, a federal agency must consult with tribal governments prior to the sale or transfer of certain federal civilian real property if the proposed sale or transfer would affect a tribe's access to federal agency services. Further, the bill prohibits the property from being sold or transferred if the sale or transfer would substantially reduce or eliminate a tribe's access to these services.</summary>
