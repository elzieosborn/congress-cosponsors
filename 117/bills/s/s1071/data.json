Specifically, the program applies to those applying for service pensions, non-service-connected disability pensions, or pensions to surviving spouses and children.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must complete a review of the pilot program and a study on the feasibility and advisability of permanently extending claim enhancement assistance to individuals and spouses applying for the specified VA pensions."
