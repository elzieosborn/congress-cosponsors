Venture capital funds are exempt from certain regulations applicable to other investment firms, including those related to filings, audits, and restricted communications with investors. Under current law, non-qualifying investments\u2014which include secondary transactions and investments in other venture capital funds\u2014may comprise up to 20% of a venture capital fund.\n\nThe bill allows investments acquired through secondary transactions or investments in other venture capital funds to be considered as qualifying investments for venture capital funds. However, for a private fund to qualify as a venture capital fund, the fund's investments must predominately (1) be acquired directly, or (2) be investments in other venture capital funds."
