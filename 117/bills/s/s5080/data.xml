This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to promulgate a federal motor vehicle safety standard that requires vehicles to be equipped with technology that enables drivers to detect and respond to objects in front of their vehicle to reduce death and injury resulting from frontovers or low-speed forward-moving vehicle incidents.

DOT must also update the Non-Traffic Surveillance (NTS) System of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to include an element for frontovers and backovers in the data maintained and summary reports published from such data.</summary>
