This bill authorizes the Department of State to publicly disclose the identity of an alien who has been denied admission into the United States because that alien's entry would pose potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. The State Department may also reveal the grounds that it relied on to make such a determination.

The President must annually report to Congress a list of individuals denied a visa on such foreign policy grounds and the justification for each denial.&#160;</summary>
