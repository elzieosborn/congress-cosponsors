This bill establishes the Next Generation Entrepreneurship Corps Program to promote entrepreneurship in the most distressed regions of the United States, including those regions affected by COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), by awarding participating fellows a two-year stipend to start and grow a new small business.

Fellows will receive (1) a $120,000, two-year stipend for living and basic startup expenses; (2) health care; and (3) interest-free federal student loan deferral for two years. Further, fellows shall receive mentorship from the Service Corps of Retired Executives and be matched with a full range of lenders, investors, and insurers.

The bill also establishes a fund in the Department of the Treasury from which the SBA may provide loans for qualified investors to support a small business owned and operated under the program by a fellow.</summary>
