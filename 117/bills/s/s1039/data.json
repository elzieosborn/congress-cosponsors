    "text": "This bill addresses disability compensation and care issues for Persian Gulf War veterans.\n\nFirst, the bill expands eligibility for disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to Persian Gulf War veterans who have a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest to any degree at any time.\n\nNext, the VA must develop a Disability Benefits Questionnaire to be used by health care personnel to identify Gulf War illness if a Persian Gulf veteran presents with any one symptom associated with such illness.\n\nThe bill also expands who qualifies as a Persian Gulf veteran by including those who served in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan during the Persian Gulf War. Under current law, Persian Gulf veteran refers only to individuals who served on active duty during the Persian Gulf War in particular areas of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nFinally, the VA must ensure its health care personnel are appropriately trained to provide care to Persian Gulf veterans."
