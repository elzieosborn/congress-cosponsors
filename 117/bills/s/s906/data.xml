This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to take various actions and implement programs related to the prevention of and response to domestic violence and child abuse and neglect among military families.

Specifically, the bill requires DOD to

 report on current and recommended staffing levels for the Family Advocacy Programs (FAPs) of the Armed Forces at each installation, ensure that appropriate statistical data on incidents report to the FAPs is shared among and across the Armed Forces, establish a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of various mechanisms to inform families about the FAPs and resiliency training of the Armed Forces during their enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, report on the results of the study conducted by the Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the Services that includes information on initial entry points for use by members of military families seeking support for domestic abuse or child abuse and neglect, and modify internal policy related to FAPs to enhance collaboration among the specified DOD programs (e.g., the Defense Suicide Prevention Office). Each military department must improve the information available to military families on the services available in connection with domestic abuse or child abuse and neglect.

Finally, the bill requires the Inspector General of DOD to report on best practices among military installations in prevention and response to domestic abuse and child abuse and neglect among military families.</summary>
