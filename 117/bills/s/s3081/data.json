    "text": "Tax Free Education Act of 2021\n\nThis bill permits tax-free distributions of up to $5,250 from 401(k) plans for qualified higher and elementary and secondary education expenses and penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for student loan expenses.\n\nThe bill also excludes from gross income, for income tax purposes, distributions up to $5,250 from employer-sponsored student loan and tuition payment plans. It repeals the limitation on the deduction of interest on student loans and increases from $15,000 to $25,000 (adjusted for inflation) the maximum contribution amounts for certain tax-preferred retirement plans.\n\nThe bill allows employees an election to treat contributions to a 401(k) plan as Roth contributions (thus exempting withdrawals from such plans from tax at retirement).\n\nFinally, the bill allows individual taxpayers a new tax deduction for their qualified higher and elementary and secondary education expenses."
