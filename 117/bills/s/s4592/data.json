Post-quantum cryptography is encryption strong enough to resist attacks from quantum computers developed in the future.\n\nNot later than one year after the National Institutes of Standards and Technology has issued post-quantum cryptography standards, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall begin to prioritize the migration of agency information technology systems to post-quantum cryptography.\n\nNot later than one year after the date of the enactment of this bill, the OMB shall submit to Congress a report on\n\n a strategy to address the risk posed by the vulnerabilities of agency information technology systems to the potential capability of a quantum computer; the funding necessary to secure such information technology systems from the threat posed by adversarial access to quantum computers; and a description of federal coordination efforts to develop standards for post-quantum cryptography, including any federal Information Processing Standards."
