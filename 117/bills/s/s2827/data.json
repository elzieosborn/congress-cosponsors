Such a debtor may also file in a district where there is a pending bankruptcy case concerning an affiliate that has a certain level of control or ownership of the debtor (e.g., if the affiliate is a controlling shareholder of the debtor), if that pending case is in a proper venue under this bill.\n\nUnder current law, these debtors may also file where they are domiciled (i.e., incorporated) or where there is a bankruptcy case pending concerning an affiliate, general partner, or partnership.\n\nFor certain debtors who are issuers of securities, their principal place of business is defined in the bill as the address of the entity's principal executive office as provided in specified Securities and Exchange Commission filings."
