The bill applies to those basin facilities that have had a structural failure resulting in a declaration of emergency in the 3-year period ending on the date the bill is enacted (e.g., the Fort Laramie Canal in both Wyoming and Nebraska, which had a tunnel collapse in July 2019).\n\nCurrent law limits funding eligibility to certain Reclamation-owned facilities that suffered a critical failure during a 2-year period ending on November 15, 2021."
