    "text": "Save Our Future Act\n\nThis bill imposes a fee on certain fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum products, and natural gas. It also imposes fees on fluorinated greenhouse gases imported into the United States and on facilities that emit greenhouse gases from processes other than fossil fuel combustion.\n\nThe bill provides rebates to middle- and low-income taxpayers equal to $800 ($1,600 for joint returns), plus $300 times the number of taxpayer dependents.\n\nThe bill directs the Department of the Treasury to provide cost mitigation grants to states and Indian tribes to assist with the transition to a low-carbon economy, assist rural households in reducing energy expenses, and for assistance to displaced coal industry workers.\n\nThe bill creates an Office of Energy Veterans Assistance. It also provides funds through FY2032 for community assistance programs, including the Appalachian Regional Commission Revitalization Initiative and the Coal Communities Assistance Initiative.\n\nThe bill provides funds for each fiscal year after FY2022 for assistance to environmental justice communities (i.e., communities most impacted by environmental harms and risks)."
