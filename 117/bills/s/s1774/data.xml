This bill requires various actions and programs related to the Oceania region, which includes Fiji, French Polynesia, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu.

The bill requires the Department of State to take actions in the region to

 develop a program to strengthen resilience to disasters; develop a program to help countries protect against threats to critical infrastructure; provide grants and assistance to build public health capacity; support efforts to address dangers from unexploded ordnance, submerged maritime vessels, and related hazards; provide financial and technical assistance to governments and organizations to combat corruption; and take steps to ensure U.S. capacity to support residents of Oceania countries who may become permanently displaced by severe weather. Furthermore, the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security must carry out a program to support regional maritime security partnerships.

In addition, the President must impose sanctions on foreign individuals and entities that engage in corruption in Oceania.

The Department of Veterans Affairs must commence a demonstration program to provide medical and extended care services to U.S. veterans residing in the freely associated states (i.e., Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Micronesia).

The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation must establish a strategy for using market-based private investment to support the development goals of Oceania countries.

The bill also requires reports on topics related to Oceania, including (1) a strategy to expand the presence of the Peace Corps, (2) the use of technology to address illegal fishing, and (3) the Department of the Treasury's financial intelligence resources.</summary>
