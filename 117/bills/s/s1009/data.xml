  <summary date="2023-08-02T22:08:23Z" status="Reported to Senate">Homeland Procurement Reform Act or the HOPR Act

This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that procurement of certain items, such as body armor and other protective gear, meets specified requirements, including that a fraction of procurement funds be used for items manufactured by U.S. small businesses.

The bill sets forth requirements for waivers of such requirements based on a national emergency or a major disaster.

DHS shall (1) ensure that covered items are purchased at a fair and reasonable price, and (2) study the adequacy of uniform allowances provided to employees of frontline operational components (i.e., Customs and Border Protection and other listed agencies and entities).

Further, DHS must report to Congress recommendations on how it can procure additional items from domestic sources and bolster the domestic supply chain for items related to national security.</summary>
