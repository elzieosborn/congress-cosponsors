The Department of Homeland Security shall request a DNA test only if the required relationship cannot be established by the presented documents and witness testimony. An adult alien who does not consent to a requested DNA test shall be inadmissible.\n\nIf the required relationship cannot be established and the immigration officer believes the alien is guilty of a felony offense, the officer may arrest the alien adult.\n\nThe bill makes it a crime for an alien adult to knowingly use a minor to whom the adult is not a relative or guardian to enter the United States."
