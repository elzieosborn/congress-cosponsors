This bill requires the Department of Energy to establish a program to provide grants or loan guarantees for certain innovative technology projects at industrial plants. The technology must (1) be technically viable at pilot scale and ready for commercial-scale implementation, (2) be able to significantly reduce energy use or greenhouse gas emissions, and (3) have the potential to significantly reduce annual U.S. industrial energy use or greenhouse gas emissions if the technology is widely implemented at appropriate industrial plants in the United States.</summary>
