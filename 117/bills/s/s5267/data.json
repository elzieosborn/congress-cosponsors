In addition, FinCEN must require U.S. persons to report cryptocurrency transactions through foreign accounts of over $10,000. FinCEN must also require digital asset kiosk owners and administrators to submit and update every three months the physical addresses of the kiosks.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must prohibit financial institutions from handling, using, or transacting business with (1) digital asset mixers, privacy coins, and other anonymity-enhancing technologies; and (2) digital assets that have been anonymized by these technologies.\n\nTreasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission must establish risk examination and review processes for anti-money laundering requirements for their respective regulated entities."
