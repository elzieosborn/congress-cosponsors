This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address sepsis. (Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.)

In particular, HHS must

 standardize the definition of sepsis; make sepsis a nationally notifiable condition; develop a national strategy for treating and eliminating the burden of sepsis; and establish a national sepsis data trust to improve the collection and sharing of data concerning sepsis cases, including through grants to support state-based data trusts.</summary>
