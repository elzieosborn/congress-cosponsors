A One Health Program recognizes the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Agriculture must develop a framework to coordinate federal activities to reduce hazards to human and animal health under the One Health Program. These departments must work with other federal entities on the framework, including the Department of Commerce.\n\nThis framework must establish goals, identify activities necessary to achieve those goals, and recommend legislation or other actions to advance One Health efforts.\n\nAdditionally, the Government Accountability Office must evaluate this framework and its implementation."
