This bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Water and Sanitation Needs Working Group to measure and report on the number and approximate geographic distribution of households that do not have access to drinking water infrastructure or a means for the safe collection and disposal of wastewater. The EPA must also establish a program under which it awards grants to nonprofit organizations for assisting such households.</summary>
