The bill also\n\n allows a tax deduction for a portion of a taxpayer's expenses for certain audits, prohibits ex parte communications between officers in the IRS Independent Office of Appeals and other IRS employees with respect to matters pending before the officers, establishes a 10-year term for the National Taxpayer Advocate, and repeals the requirement to submit a partial payment with an offer-in-compromise to settle a tax liability."
