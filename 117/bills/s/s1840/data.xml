  <summary date="2021-07-08T15:52:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2021

This bill generally prohibits deceptive practices, false statements, and voter interference regarding federal elections.

Specifically, the bill prohibits any person, within 60 days before a federal election, from communicating, causing to be communicated, or producing for communication certain information on voting, if the person (1) knows such information to be materially false, and (2) has the intent to impede or prevent another person from exercising the right to vote in an election.

The bill also prohibits false statements regarding public endorsements and hindering, interfering with, or preventing voting or registering to vote.

A private right of action for preventive relief is established for persons aggrieved by violations of these prohibitions.

Criminal penalties are also established for violations.

If the Department of Justice (DOJ) receives a credible report that materially false information has been or is being communicated in violation of these prohibitions, and state and local election officials have not adequately communicated corrected information, DOJ must communicate to the public accurate information designed to correct the materially false information.</summary>
