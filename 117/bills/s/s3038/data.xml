This bill requires the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review certain investments made by China in the United States.

Specifically, the committee must review any investment by a foreign person that (1) involves the acquisition of real estate in the United States and the establishment of a U.S. business on such real estate, and (2) could result in direct or indirect control of that U.S. business by China. A party to any such investment must submit to the committee a declaration containing basic information regarding the transaction.</summary>
