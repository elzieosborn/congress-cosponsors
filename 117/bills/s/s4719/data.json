    "text": "Preventing Child Sex Abuse Act of 2022\n\nThis bill makes changes to the federal law prohibiting child sexual tourism.\n\nFirst, the bill revises the specific intent required for certain offenses involving interstate or foreign travel to engage in or facilitate illicit sexual conduct. Specifically, this bill requires the government to prove that an individual traveled (or facilitated travel) with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct (currently, with a motivating purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct). Further, it specifies that the term intent is to be construed as any intention to engage in illicit sexual conduct at the time of the travel.\n\nSecond, the bill establishes new criminal offenses for acts in furtherance of illicit sexual conduct by an officer, director, employee, or agent of an organization through his or her connection to or affiliation with the organization. A violation is subject to a fine, a prison term of up to 30 years, or both.\n\nFinally, the bill specifies that the term sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense does not require interpersonal physical contact."
