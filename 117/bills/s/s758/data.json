    "text": "Combating Global Poverty Through Energy Development Act\n\nThis bill supports the elimination of restrictions that limit support for certain energy projects at specified international financial institutions.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Department of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive directors of certain financial institutions (e.g., the International Finance Corporation, the International Monetary Fund, and the Inter-American Development Bank) to (1) oppose any restriction or prohibition on the financing of coal, oil, natural gas, or civil nuclear energy projects; and (2) seek to rescind current restrictions or prohibitions on this financing.\n\nFurther, not more than 50% of amounts made available for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development may be used until Treasury certifies that the bank (1) has rescinded any restrictions or prohibitions on the financing of coal, oil, natural gas, or civil nuclear energy projects; and (2) has in effect a policy promoting the financing of these projects.\n\n Treasury must coordinate with designated agencies to identify steps the United States can take to promote international financing of these energy projects in order to help developing countries access affordable and reliable power."
