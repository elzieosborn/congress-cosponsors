This bill expands the allowable uses of state compensation payments for crime victims to include certain expenses for angel families. Angel family refers to the immediate family members of any individual who is a victim of homicide committed by (1) an individual who is unlawfully present in the United States, or (2) a member of an international criminal organization involved in the unlawful trafficking of controlled substances.

The bill also reestablishes the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office within the Department of Homeland Security.</summary>
