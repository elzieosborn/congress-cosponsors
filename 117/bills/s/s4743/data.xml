This bill directs the National Institute of Justice within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to study the factors that contribute to acts of animal cruelty. The report must also analyze acts of animal cruelty as a predictor of future violence against humans.

Additionally, the bill authorizes DOJ to establish a grant program to support the development and strengthening of detection strategies and early intervention or diversion resources to stop acts of animal cruelty and rehabilitate offenders.</summary>
