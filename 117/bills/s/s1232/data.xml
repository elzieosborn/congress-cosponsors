  <summary date="2021-10-19T20:47:11Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill modifies the calculation of loan amounts for partnerships with no employees (e.g., self-employed farmers) under the Paycheck Protection Program, which was established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19.

Specifically, the bill allows such individuals to apply for a loan in the amount of the difference between their gross and net income loan amounts, even if they have already received a loan based on their net income and received forgiveness for that loan.</summary>
