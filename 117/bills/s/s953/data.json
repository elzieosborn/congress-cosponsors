    "text": "Water for Conservation and Farming Act\n\nThis bill establishes a funding source for certain water resources development projects in western states. The bill also reauthorizes and expands existing water resources development programs, as well as establishes new programs.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes the Bureau of Reclamation Infrastructure Fund to fund water-related programs, including water reclamation and reuse projects, dam safety projects, and the WaterSMART program (which provides assistance to eligible government entities to increase water supply). Each year from FY2031-FY2061, the Department of the Treasury must deposit $300 million of revenues into this fund that would otherwise be deposited into the Reclamation Fund (which currently funds irrigation works in western states).\n\nThe bill also expands the allowable uses for grants under the WaterSMART program.\n\nNext, the bill revises the Reclamation Climate Change and Water program (which assesses the impact of climate change on water supplies) by requiring Reclamation to develop a strategy to address sustaining native biodiversity during periods of drought.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes through FY2028 the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation program (which funds fish passage projects in certain areas that drain into the Pacific Ocean).\n\nFinally, the bill establishes new programs directed at western states to\n\n provide assistance to agricultural producers to create and maintain waterbird and shorebird habitats, award grants to eligible government entities and nonprofit conservation organizations for habitat restoration projects that improve watershed health, and prepare plans to sustain the survival of critically important fisheries during periods of drought."
