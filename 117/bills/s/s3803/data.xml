This bill addresses social, economic, and community well-being and resilience in rural communities.

Specifically, the bill establishes, within the Executive Office of the President, the Office of Rural Prosperity to promote and support social and economic prosperity in rural areas. The office, among other duties, must develop (1) a strategy for rural development, and (2) metrics to measure the effectiveness of federal programs on rural areas.

Additionally, the bill sets up a council that includes representatives from federal agencies and White House policy offices to ensure collaboration across federal agencies and with other stakeholders concerning the needs of rural areas.

The bill also requires the Department of Agriculture to develop, and report on the implementation of, a rural prosperity action plan that addresses structural challenges that affect rural communities.</summary>
