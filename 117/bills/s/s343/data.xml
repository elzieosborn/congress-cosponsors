  <summary date="2021-03-11T14:19:13Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fly Safe Canine COVID Detection Act of 2021

This bill requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to conduct a feasibility study on the use of canine units to detect the presence of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) in individuals with the virus.

The TSA must also determine (1) whether the canine units can be used at airports to screen passengers, individuals accompanying passengers, crew members, and other individuals passing through airports and airport screening locations; and (2) how the screening would be implemented and what metrics would be used to monitor the efficacy of the screening.</summary>
