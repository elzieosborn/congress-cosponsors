This bill specifies that certain activities do not establish an employment relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee (or their respective employees) for the purpose of certain federal labor laws.

Specifically, an employment relationship is not formed if the franchisor carries out activities that include

 providing, or otherwise requiring the use of, certain training or other materials related to sexual harassment, workplace violence, or discrimination; requiring the adoption of certain policies related to sexual harassment, workplace violence, or discrimination; requiring the adoption of a policy based on COVID-19; or providing personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.</summary>
