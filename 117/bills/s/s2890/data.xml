This bill allows National Health Service Corps (NHSC) participants to apply for a deferral of their service obligation period in order to receive training in palliative care. The Department of Health and Human Services may grant a deferral for up to one year.

The NHSC provides scholarships and student loan repayment awards to primary care, dental, and mental health providers who agree to complete a service obligation period by working in areas designated as having a shortage of those types of providers.</summary>
