This bill directs the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to submit an annual report on disaster damage to its facilities and contract prisons. The report must explain the effects of the damage on inmates and staff. The report must also include any corrective actions the BOP will take to modernize emergency preparedness plans and legislative recommendations to improve emergency preparedness within the BOP.

The bill also requires the National Institute of Corrections to conduct a public field hearing on how correctional facilities can incorporate in their emergency preparedness plans and recovery efforts various elements, including access to programs and services for inmates and risk management best practices for staff.</summary>
