This bill prohibits a dealer from selling, leasing, or loaning a used motor vehicle until a defect of the motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment or noncompliance with a federal motor vehicle safety standard has been remedied, with specified exceptions.

The prohibition does not apply if

 the recall information regarding the used vehicle was not available at the time of sale or lease and was not on the manufacturer's website; notification of the defect or noncompliance is required, but enforcement of an order to notify of and remedy the defect or noncompliance is set aside in a civil action on a motion for change of venue; the used vehicle is sold at wholesale; or the used vehicle is a junk automobile with all required information reported to the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System. If a vehicle manufacturer fails to provide the dealer with a remedy for a used vehicle's safety defect within 60 days, the manufacture must pay the dealer an amount that is not less than one percent of the fair-market value of the vehicle per month. The total payment amount may not exceed the fair-market value of the vehicle.</summary>
