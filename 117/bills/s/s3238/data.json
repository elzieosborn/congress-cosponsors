The bill also prohibits the issuance of new special certificates that allow payment of subminimum wages to people with disabilities and phases out existing certificates over a five-year period.\n\nFurther, Labor's Office of Disability Employment must award grants for technical assistance and other strategic support to employers transitioning from special certificates to competitive integrated employment for people with disabilities.\n\nLabor must contract with a nonprofit entity to conduct an evaluation of the impact of these transitions."
