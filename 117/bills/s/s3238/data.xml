This bill addresses employment standards for people with disabilities.

First, the Department of Labor must award grants to states and certain eligible entities to assist them in transforming their business and program models to support people with disabilities by

 providing competitive integrated employment, assisting them in finding and retaining work in such employment, providing them with integrated employment and integrated community participation and wraparound services, and ensuring that such services comply with federal regulations for individuals receiving home and community-based services. The bill also prohibits the issuance of new special certificates that allow payment of subminimum wages to people with disabilities and phases out existing certificates over a five-year period.

Further, Labor's Office of Disability Employment must award grants for technical assistance and other strategic support to employers transitioning from special certificates to competitive integrated employment for people with disabilities.

Labor must contract with a nonprofit entity to conduct an evaluation of the impact of these transitions.</summary>
