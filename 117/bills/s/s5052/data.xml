This bill requires research and reports on technology to address illicit drug trafficking.

For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must develop a program to measure the effectiveness of technologies and strategies used by federal agencies to address the illicit trafficking of fentanyl and its precursors into the United States. Under the program, DHS must periodically report to Congress an analysis of technologies used in drug interdiction. The Government Accountability Office must&#160;periodically report to Congress on recommendations for improving the data collected and metrics used under the program.</summary>
