    "text": "This bill requires the federal government to fully fund the costs of dam safety modifications of certain dikes owned by the Bureau of Reclamation. The bill also requires the federal government to fully fund gate replacements or repairs for certain dams for the next 10 years. The bill applies to certain Reclamation-owned dams or dikes completed not later than December 31, 1948 (e.g., the Altus Dam and dikes in the W.C. Austin Project in Oklahoma).\n\nUnder current law, the federal government is required to fully fund the operation and maintenance costs of certain Reclamation-owned dikes that were completed not later than December 31, 1945. However, current law requires the federal government to fund only 85% of certain dam safety modifications."
