The bill tasks the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with administering the system. (Currently, the system is jointly administered by NOAA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)\n\nThe bill also authorizes financial assistance for projects to increase awareness, education, and research about extreme heat events and prioritizes projects that serve historically disadvantaged communities and communities with the greatest risk or highest incidence of heat-related illnesses and deaths.\n\nAdditionally, NOAA must contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study relevant policy, research, and data gaps concerning extreme heat information and response.\n\nThe bill also establishes an interagency committee within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop a strategic plan and otherwise coordinate federal activities related to addressing health risks and impacts of heat."
