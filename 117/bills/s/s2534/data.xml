This bill allows an urbanized area with 200,000 or more residents to use a portion of its Urbanized Area Formula Grants for operating expenses to increase the frequency and availability of public transportation. Under current law, the grants support various transit planning and related activities in urbanized areas; however, only areas with fewer than 200,000 residents may use funds for transit operating expenses.</summary>
