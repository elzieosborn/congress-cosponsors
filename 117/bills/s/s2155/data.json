A statewide election administrator may suspend, remove, or relieve the duties of a local election administrator only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance while in office.\n\n Further, the bill establishes certain requirements for challenging an individual's eligibility to register to vote or vote in federal elections.\n\nThe bill also sets a minimum distance for poll observers."
