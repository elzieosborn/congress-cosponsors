This bill places the Secretary of Agriculture on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and it requires the committee to review any investment that could result in foreign control of any U.S. agricultural business.

Further, it includes agricultural systems and supply chains in the definitions of critical infrastructure and critical technologies for the purposes of reviewing such investments.

The Department of Agriculture and the Government Accountability Office must each analyze and report on foreign influence in the U.S. agricultural industry.</summary>
