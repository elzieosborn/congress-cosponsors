The samples may be used for preparedness and response activities, developing medical products for emerging infectious diseases, and similar purposes.\n\nAdditionally, HHS may contract with public and private entities to increase the capacity to rapidly develop, validate, and disseminate diagnostic tests to health departments and other entities to respond to emerging infectious diseases with significant potential to cause a public health emergency."
