This bill expands the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program to support recruitment efforts by law enforcement agencies.

Specifically, the bill expands the COPS program by

 allowing funds to be used for reducing application-related fees (e.g., fees for background checks, psychological evaluations, and testing); and directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award competitive grants to partnerships between law enforcement agencies and educational institutions (e.g., elementary schools and institutions of higher education) for recruiting activities, such as for career and job fairs. The bill requires DOJ to establish guidance for understaffed law enforcement agencies applying for COPS grants.

The Government Accountability Office must study and report on the effects of recruitment and attrition rates on federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies.</summary>
