  <summary date="2022-11-01T13:57:00Z" status="Reported to Senate">Ethiopia Peace and Stabilization Act of 2022

This bill addresses U.S. efforts to support a peaceful, democratic Ethiopia and bring an end to the country's civil conflict.

The President may provide support for efforts (1) by the African Union or other credible entities to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict across Ethiopia; (2) to engage in peace building, mediation, and community reconciliation; and (3) to pursue accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ethiopia.

The Department of State must develop and implement strategies to support democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Ethiopia. The State Department must also ensure the implementation of a strategy, to be developed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, to support conflict mitigation and management, reconciliation, and trauma healing for Ethiopians affected by the conflict.

The President must impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign individuals and entities that have engaged in certain actions related to the conflict in Ethiopia, such as taking significant actions to undermine efforts to end the conflict or deriving significant benefit from efforts to impede the transition to democracy.

The bill also (1) prohibits the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation from providing support for economic development projects in Ethiopia, (2) suspends any U.S. security assistance to the government of Ethiopia, and (3) requires U.S. representatives at international financial institutions to oppose any loan or extension of assistance to the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea. These restrictions shall continue until there is a resolution of the civil conflict.</summary>
