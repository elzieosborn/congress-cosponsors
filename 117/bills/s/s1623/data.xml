  <summary date="2021-06-23T20:04:34Z" status="Introduced in Senate">State Allowance for a Variety of Exchanges Act of 2021 or the SAVE Act of 2021

This bill allows the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to support the establishment of state-based health insurance exchanges in those states that have not already elected to do so. A state that receives a grant must ensure that the resulting exchange is self-sustaining by 2026.</summary>
