These programs must provide assistance to borrowers of federal student loans, including by educating borrowers about their rights and responsibilities with respect to federal student loans.\n\nED must (1) make publicly available through its website a list of programs receiving grant funds; and (2) ensure that each holder, servicer, and collector of federal student loans provides at least one federal student loan liaison to communicate with such assistance programs on various issues,\u00a0including the\u00a0handling of borrower complaints."
