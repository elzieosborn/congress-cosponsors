This bill makes changes to grant programs administered by the Forest Service to promote wood products.

Specifically, the bill reauthorizes through FY2026 and modifies a program that supports capital costs for installing community wood energy systems and building innovative wood products facilities, including by increasing the maximum grant amount per facility.

The bill also modifies a program that provides grants to develop and expand the market for innovative wood products. Specifically, the bill (1) modifies the grant priorities, and (2) increases the portion of a project's cost that may be covered by such a grant.</summary>
