  <summary date="2021-10-25T14:45:53Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Stop shielding Assets from Corporate Known Liability by Eliminating non-debtor Releases Act or the SACKLER Act 

This bill prohibits a bankruptcy court from releasing claims against non-debtors brought by states, tribes, municipalities, or the federal government. However, the bankruptcy court may issue a stay not exceeding 90 days regarding such a claim.

Complex bankruptcies may involve creditor claims against non-debtors associated with the debtor, such as the debtor's officers, directors, or employees. Currently, in carrying out a bankruptcy plan, certain courts may release non-debtors from liability (there is a circuit split regarding this practice).</summary>
