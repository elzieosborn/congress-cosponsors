Specifically, the bill expands the liability protections to include donations of an apparently fit grocery product or apparently wholesome food

 for which the recipient is charged a good Samaritan reduced price that is no greater than the cost of handling, administering, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, and distributing the food or product; or that is donated directly to a needy individual at zero cost by a retail grocer, wholesaler, agricultural producer, agricultural processor, agricultural distributor, restaurant, caterer, school food authority, or institution of higher education.</summary>
