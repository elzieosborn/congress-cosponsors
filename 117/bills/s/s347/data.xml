  <summary date="2021-05-06T13:33:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Data to Save Moms Act

This bill expands data collection and research on maternal morbidity and mortality among minority populations.

Specifically, the bill adds requirements to a program within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that supports maternal mortality review committees. To the extent practicable, the committees must

 use the most up-to-date indicators of severe maternal morbidity; review deaths caused by suicide, overdose, or other behavioral health conditions attributed to or aggravated by pregnancy or childbirth; and consult with representatives of communities about nonclinical factors that may contribute to adverse maternal outcomes. The CDC may also award grants to committees to increase their engagement with local communities, such as by bringing on community representatives as committee members.

Additionally, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality must consult with diverse stakeholders to review maternal health data collection processes and quality measures and make recommendations to improve them.

The Indian Health Service and the Department of Health and Human Services must also arrange for studies on adverse maternal health outcomes among tribal and minority populations, respectively.</summary>
