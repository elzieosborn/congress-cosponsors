It also provides grants for projects that may have combined heat and power and energy storage as project components.\n\nStates must use at least 40% of grant funds to implement projects in environmental justice communities or low-income communities that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic."
