This bill requires certain disclosures in relation to amicus briefs (i.e., briefs that are filed by those who are not a party to a case but have an interest in the case).

Specifically, each amicus brief that is filed in a U.S. court of appeals or the Supreme Court must list the name of any person who contributed (1) to the preparation or submission of the brief, (2) at least 3% of the gross annual revenue of the entity filing the brief for the previous year, or (3) more than $100,000 in the previous year to the filer. Such requirements do not apply to routine commercial transactions that are unrelated to amicus brief filings.

The bill also prohibits those who file amicus briefs from giving gifts or providing travel to a judge of a U.S. court of appeals or a justice of the Supreme Court, except for reimbursements for travel expenses in relation to law school appearances.

Violators are subject to civil penalties.</summary>
