  <summary date="2022-09-26T10:59:55Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill authorizes a three-year pilot program under which the Department of Defense may use noncompetitive procedures for awarding follow-on contracts to qualified businesses wholly-owned through an ESOP (i.e., an S corporation for which 100% of the outstanding stock is held through an employee stock ownership plan) if the prior contract was rated as satisfactory or better. The Government Accountability Office must report on the individual and aggregate uses of the authority provided under this bill.</summary>
