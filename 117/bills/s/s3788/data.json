    "text": "Housing for All Act of 2022\n\nThis bill modifies existing, and creates new, grants and programs concerning affordable housing and homelessness.\n\nIn particular, the bill authorizes federal funding of the Housing Trust Fund, which supports affordable housing activities. Currently, contributions to the fund come from the earnings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nAdditionally, the bill (1) expands eligibility for housing choice vouchers, which provide rental assistance to low-income individuals; and (2) entitles certain individuals to the vouchers. Other matters addressed in the bill include permanently authorizing the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (which terminates on October 1, 2028) and modifying existing programs that support housing for the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and individuals experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness.\n\nThe bill also creates various housing-related grant programs to, for example, support overnight parking for individuals who live in vehicles and no-cost legal assistance with evictions for low-income individuals. The bill also incorporates housing into certain transportation grants and programs."
