This bill allows a foreign-built vessel that transports passengers between U.S. ports and places to obtain an endorsement that entitles the vessel to engage in coastwise trade. To obtain the endorsement under current law, a vessel that transports passengers between domestic locations generally must be built in the United States.</summary>
