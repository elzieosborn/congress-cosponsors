    "text": "Preventing Releases Of Toxic Environmental Contaminants Threatening Our Great Lakes Act or the PROTECT Our Great Lakes Act \n\nThis bill addresses pipeline safety and oil spill preparedness and response in the Great Lakes Basin and elsewhere.\n\nFor example, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) must revise its regulations to ensure that oil spill response plans it receives adequately anticipate and ensure an adequate response to spills of diluted bitumen.\n\nAdditionally, the PHMSA must promulgate regulations requiring each operator of a pipeline located in a high consequence area to implement the best available technology for (1) real-time monitoring of the pipeline through pressure monitoring at shutoff valves, product flow monitoring, or product wave flow monitoring; (2) shutting off the pipeline; and (3) isolating product flow through the installation of shutoff valves.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Department of Transportation to establish higher minimum rates of basic pay for employees of the PHMSA.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may receive and utilize gifts and bequests of property to aid or facilitate its work or the work of the Center of Expertise for Great Lakes Oil Spill Preparedness and Response, including by carrying out research related to the center and the impacts of oil spills in freshwater environments such as the Great Lakes Basin."
