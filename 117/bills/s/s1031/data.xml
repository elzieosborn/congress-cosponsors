  <summary date="2021-12-03T11:00:36Z" status="Public Law">This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study to assess whether there are disparities associated with race and ethnicity with respect to (1) compensation benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), (2) disability ratings determined by the VA, and (3) the rejection of fully developed claims for VA benefits. The GAO must also develop recommendations to facilitate better data collection on such disparities associated with race and ethnicity.

Within one year, the GAO must brief Congress on the initial results of the study. The GAO must also submit a final report on the study following the briefing.</summary>
