Eligible recipients are accredited entities that are administering a medical residency or medical fellowship program in the United States or a territory of the United States.\n\nGrants disbursed under the pilot program must be used to establish or maintain programs in which medical residents or fellows provide pro bono medical examinations and opinions to assist veterans in applying for service-connected disability benefits.\n\nThe VA must partner with veterans service organizations to provide outreach regarding the availability of services under the pilot program."
