  <summary date="2022-02-11T19:08:41Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Financial Factors in Selecting Retirement Plan Investments Act

This bill permits fiduciaries of employer-sponsored retirement plans to consider environmental, social, governance, or similar factors when making investment decisions.

It also nullifies the rule published by the Employee Benefits Security Administration on November 13, 2020, that requires fiduciaries to select investments and investment courses of action based solely on financial considerations.</summary>
