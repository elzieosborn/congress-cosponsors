The report shall also discuss related subjects, including the extent to which such materials are exported and efforts by the Saudi government to remove the intolerant content.\n\nThe State Department shall issue such reports for 10 years, unless the State Department determines that the intolerant content has been completely removed. If such content is still included in Saudi Arabia's educational materials after 10 years, the State Department shall continue reporting to Congress for another 5 years."
