The interagency coordinator must (1) coordinate the U.S. government's response to anomalous health incidents, (2) ensure that affected personnel and dependents get access to care, and (3) ensure adequate training and education for relevant U.S. government personnel.\n\nThe bill also requires certain agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to designate an appropriate senior official to serve as the Anomalous Health Incident Agency Coordination Lead. These officials must (1) work with the interagency coordinator to achieve objectives related to anomalous health incidents, and (2) jointly provide quarterly briefings to Congress on its activities.\n\nSuch agencies must also develop updated workplace guidance to address anomalous health incidents, including processes to self-report suspected exposure to a possible anomalous health incident."
