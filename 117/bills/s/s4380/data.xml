This bill requires that not less than 75% of the total number of contracted non-tactical vehicles purchased, leased by, or for use of the Department of Defense (DOD) must be electric or zero emission vehicles (or a federally authorized alternative) and use a charging connector type that meets applicable industry accepted standards for interoperability and safety.

The bill also authorizes DOD to furnish electric vehicle charging stations at a commissary store or MWR retail facility (i.e., exchange stores and other revenue-generating facilities operated by nonappropriated fund activities of DOD) for commercial use by individuals authorized to access such facilities.</summary>
