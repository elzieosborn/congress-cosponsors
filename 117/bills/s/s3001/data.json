The bill provides funding to support the changes.\n\nSpecifically, the bill permits individuals who do not have minimum essential coverage to, in conjunction with filing their tax return, determine whether any members of their household are eligible for an insurance affordability program and enroll in minimum essential coverage.\n\nThe bill makes individuals eligible for Medicaid or CHIP based on a prior finding of eligibility for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also revises the continuous coverage standards under Medicaid and CHIP.\n\nAdditionally, the bill provides access to certain information to support enrollment in insurance affordability programs."
