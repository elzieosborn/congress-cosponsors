The U.S. company must also agree in writing to not (1) alter political content in its motion picture in response to or in anticipation of a request from China's government, or (2) coproduce the motion picture with an entity located in China that is subject to political content restrictions from China's government.\n\nA U.S. company that has taken such actions during the reporting period shall be prohibited from receiving federal support."
