This bill prohibits federal support for a U.S. company that alters political content in its motion pictures (e.g., movies and television shows) in response to or in anticipation of a request from China's government.

Under this bill, political content is content relating to issues considered sensitive by the Chinese Communist Party or China's government, such as Taiwan or the Tiananmen Square massacre.

To be eligible to receive federal support (e.g., a contract for production or access to a federally controlled asset) for a motion picture, a U.S. company must provide to the Department of State a list of motion pictures it has submitted to China's government for approval for dissemination during the reporting period (the previous 10 years or since this bill was enacted, whichever period is shorter). The U.S. company must also agree in writing to not (1) alter political content in its motion picture in response to or in anticipation of a request from China's government, or (2) coproduce the motion picture with an entity located in China that is subject to political content restrictions from China's government.

A U.S. company that has taken such actions during the reporting period shall be prohibited from receiving federal support.</summary>
