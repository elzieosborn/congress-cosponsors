    "text": "International Pandemic Preparedness and COVID-19 Response Act of 2021\n\nThis bill outlines U.S. foreign policy to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and to future pandemics and disasters.\n\nWith respect to COVID-19, the Department of State must develop a strategy to expand and expedite access to COVID-19 vaccines in other countries. The bill also allows for the use of any foreign assistance for activities to combat COVID-19, regardless of the original purpose of the funding. Additionally, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development must protect and support humanitarian actors responding to secondary effects of the pandemic (e.g., food insecurity).\n\nFurthermore, the State Department must report on, and take other steps to address, restrictions and violations of human rights in the COVID-19 response measures of other countries, and the U.S. Agency for Global Media must focus its communication programs on combating propaganda and providing accurate information related to COVID-19.\n\nWith respect to future pandemics and disasters, the bill (1) designates agencies responsible for carrying out preparedness and response activities, and (2) authorizes a committee within the National Security Council to coordinate government-wide response efforts. Additionally, the President must establish a strategy for advancing U.S. global health security; the bill creates a position in the State Department to promote this strategy.\n\nMoreover, the State Department must work with other international actors to establish a financing mechanism and otherwise promote global health security, including by strengthening health systems and disease surveillance in developing countries.\n\nAdditionally, funding authorized by this bill may not be made available to China."
