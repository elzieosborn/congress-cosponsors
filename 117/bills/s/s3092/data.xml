This act addresses the federal government's approach to wildfires.

Specifically, the act requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to report to Congress regarding the use of relocation assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for wildfire risk.

FEMA, in coordination with the National Weather Service, must study, develop recommendations for, and initiate a process for the use of forecasts and data, including information that supports Red Flag Warnings and similar weather alert and notification methods, to establish

 plans and actions that can be implemented prior to a wildfire event that can limit the impact, duration, or severity of the fire; and mechanisms to increase interagency collaboration to expedite the delivery of disaster assistance. The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress regarding wildfires, including the effectiveness of FEMA programs.

Each state, local agency, or private mental health organization providing professional crisis counseling assistance must ensure that those providing case management services to victims of a major disaster have training to address impacts in communities and to individuals with socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.

FEMA must conduct a study and develop a plan to address providing housing assistance to survivors of major disasters or emergencies when presented with challenges such as the presence of multiple families within a single household.

The act allows Indian tribal governments to apply for grants for equipping, upgrading, and constructing state and local emergency operations centers.</summary>
