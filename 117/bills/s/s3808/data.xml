This bill authorizes the Department of the Interior to grant leases on the Outer Continental Shelf for activities that produce or support production, transportation, or transmission of energy from sources other than oil and gas (e.g., wind energy) in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic and Straits of Florida Planning Areas.

In September of 2020, presidential memorandums placed a moratorium on all energy leases in those areas for a 10-year period. This bill allows energy leases from such sources in those areas during that time.</summary>
