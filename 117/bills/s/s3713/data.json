    "text": "Reproductive Choice Act\n\nThis bill provides statutory authority for certain Supreme Court holdings on abortion rights and restrictions in the cases of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.\n\nIn Roe, the Court held that the Constitution protects a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. In Casey, the Court reaffirmed this holding and additionally held that state abortion regulations may not place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before fetal viability (i.e., an undue burden). However, a state may (1) restrict abortions after viability, except when a pregnancy endangers the life or health of the woman; and (2) enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion, except for unnecessary health regulations that present a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.\n\nThe bill provides statutory authority for these holdings. It also specifies that the bill does not affect laws regarding conscience protection."
