The strategy must include specified elements, including a description of actions the President will take to ensure the basic needs of the U.S. civilian population in a catastrophic incident are met.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security shall lead an exercise, as part of a national exercise program, to test and enhance the operationalization of the strategy.\n\nThe President must provide recommendations for (1) actions that should be taken to prepare the United States to implement the strategy, increase readiness, and address preparedness gaps; and (2) additional authorities that should be considered to more effectively implement the strategy."
