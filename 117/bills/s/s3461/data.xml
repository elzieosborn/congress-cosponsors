This bill prohibits the use of federal funds to carry out the emergency temporary standard issued by the Department of Labor for preventing the transmission of COVID-19 in employment settings.

Under the standard issued on November 15, 2021, employers with 100 or more employees must require their onsite employees to either be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. Labor withdrew the standard effective January 26, 2022.</summary>
