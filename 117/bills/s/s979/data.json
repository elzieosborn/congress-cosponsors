The bill also reauthorizes through FY2026 the fund that supports the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program.\n\nIn addition, the FCC must establish an automated connection to share data between the National Lifeline Eligibility Verifier and the National Accuracy Clearinghouse for SNAP. The FCC must coordinate with the Department of Agriculture to establish the connection."
