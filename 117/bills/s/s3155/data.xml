This bill imposes sanctions on individuals involved in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, establishes requirements for arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, and addresses other related issues.

The bill imposes sanctions on persons named in an Office of the Director of National Intelligence report assessing the role of Saudi Arabia's government in Khashoggi's killing. The President may waive the sanctions for national security interests on a case-by-case basis upon providing certain information and certifications to Congress. Such a waiver may last for up to 90 days and may be renewed.

If the President determines that Saudi Arabia's government has engaged in a pattern of intimidation and harassment against U.S. persons or their family members, the President must suspend the provision of certain defense-related assistance until the pattern has ceased.

The Department of State must provide certain information to Congress before concluding a sale or authorizing the export or transfer of controlled defense articles (or defense services) to Saudi Arabia, including a certification that Saudi Arabia's government has provided a written commitment to not use such articles to violate human rights.

The U.S. government may not provide or authorize the export of services for military, paramilitary, security, or intelligence-gathering activities to Saudi Arabia, with certain exceptions.

The State Department may annually present the Jamal Khashoggi Press Freedom Award to recognize extraordinary efforts in journalism in the face of harassment, detention, or obstruction by foreign governments or non-state actors.</summary>
