This bill requires the implementation of certain contracting provisions related to human trafficking.

Specifically, the bill requires, upon receipt of an office of inspector general report substantiating an allegation that the recipient of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement (or any subgrantee, subcontractor, or agent of the recipient) engaged in human trafficking, that the agency refer the matter to the agency suspension and debarment office (current law requires that the agency consider remedial actions that include such referral).

The Office of Management and Budget must report to Congress on implementation of provisions to end human trafficking in government contracting.</summary>
