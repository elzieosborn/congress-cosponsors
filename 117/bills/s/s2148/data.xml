This bill requires the President to impose sanctions and take other actions related to COVID-19 if certain conditions are not met.

Specifically, if the President is unable to certify within 90 days of this bill's enactment that China's government has allowed a transparent international forensic investigation into the origins of COVID-19 and certain laboratories in the city of Wuhan, the President must (1) impose visa- and property-blocking sanctions against individuals with leadership positions in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), (2) prohibit federal funding for collaborative projects between U.S.-based researchers and CAS researchers in any academic field, and (3) prohibit U.S.-based researchers and institutions that receive federal funding from engaging in certain research on viruses with individuals or institutions based in China.</summary>
