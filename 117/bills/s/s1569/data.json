The bill also advances implementation of certain data-sharing agreements and notifications to help students who apply for federal financial aid to also apply for and receive other federal means-tested benefits (e.g., Section 8 tenant-based housing assistance, Medicaid, and Supplemental Security Income).\n\nIn addition, the bill (1) requires questions about food and housing insecurity to be incorporated into the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, and (2) establishes a grant program to support research and address incidences of food and housing insecurity among college students."
