Currently, a similar tax credit exists for employers who hire certain disadvantaged individuals, including disadvantaged veterans.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security (with respect to the Coast Guard), the Department of Commerce (with respect to officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), and the Department of Health and Human Services (with respect to the Public Health Service) to implement flexible spending arrangements that permit members of the uniformed services to use basic pay and compensation to pay for childcare services for their dependent children on a pretax basis."
