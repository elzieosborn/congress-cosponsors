The bill requires DHS to use the least restrictive restraint necessary and prohibits certain specified restraint types, including four-point restraints and binding hands behind the detainee's back.\n\nThe bill prohibits DHS detention officers from being present during a detainee's pelvic exam, labor, delivery, or treatment relating to a pregnancy, unless specifically requested by medical personnel. If a detention officer is requested by medical personnel, such officer shall be female, if practicable, and remain at a reasonable distance from the detainee.\n\nA pregnant detainee must have access to health care services, including comprehensive services relating to reproductive health care and pregnancy.\n\nDHS must provide annual training about this bill's requirements to each employee who has a role in the detention or care of a pregnant detainee or a postpartum parent of a newborn. DHS must also provide each detainee notice of their rights under this bill in the detainee's native language."
