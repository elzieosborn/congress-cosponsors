In addition, the bill restricts the commission's use and disclosure of any personal health information or proprietary business and financial information obtained in conducting the study.\n\nThe commission must report its findings, conclusions, and recommendations (as well as those of any dissenting members of the commission) for balancing privacy protections and the appropriate use of personal health information.\n\nThe commission terminates 30 days after submitting its final report."
