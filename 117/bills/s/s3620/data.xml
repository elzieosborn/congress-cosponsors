This bill temporarily establishes a commission with members appointed through the Government Accountability Office to study and report on issues related to protecting individual privacy while advancing the use of personal health information.

The study must address, for example, the use of personal health information by federal, state, and local governments for public health activities and the various statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to such information. In addition, the bill restricts the commission's use and disclosure of any personal health information or proprietary business and financial information obtained in conducting the study.

The commission must report its findings, conclusions, and recommendations (as well as those of any dissenting members of the commission) for balancing privacy protections and the appropriate use of personal health information.

The commission terminates 30 days after submitting its final report.</summary>
