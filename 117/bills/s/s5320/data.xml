  <summary date="2023-02-13T19:54:58Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill defers the collection of income taxes from a U.S. national who is unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad until 180 days after such national is released from detention, returns to the United States, or departs the detaining country. It also requires the reimbursement of penalties for late payment of income taxes that become due during such detainment.

The bill suspends for 270 days after the release of a U.S. national the running of a statute of limitations for the collection of income taxes deferred by this bill.

The deferral allowed by this bill does not apply to social security taxes imposed on employees.</summary>
