This safe harbor applies if (1) such digital asset is not classified as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or by a U.S. court; and (2) the exchange or intermediary complies with requirements regarding listings, customer protection, and disclosures. If a digital asset is determined to be a security and otherwise meets these requirements, the exchange or intermediary has a two year period during which the SEC may not pursue specified enforcement activity against the exchange or intermediary."
