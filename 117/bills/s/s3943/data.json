Such organizations must establish and administer due process requirements for the investigation of any member institution, student athlete enrolled in such member institution, or other individual for infractions of the athletic association's bylaws or failure to meet the conditions and obligations of membership.\n\nThe Department of Justice must establish procedures for (1) individuals and entities to file complaints, (2) the investigation of complaints that have a substantial probability of validity, and (3) the investigation of other violations of this bill."
