This bill provides statutory authority for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirement that federal agencies must submit at least one proposal for reducing direct spending before taking a discretionary administrative action that increases direct spending. Further, an agency must submit to the OMB its legal basis for concluding that a proposed administrative action is nondiscretionary and, therefore, not subject to this requirement.</summary>
