This bill expands consumer information disclosure requirements related to student completion or graduation rates at institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student-aid programs.

Currently,&#160;such IHEs must disclose the completion or graduation rate of first-time, full-time, certificate- or degree-seeking undergraduate students. This bill expands disclosure requirements to include the completion or graduation rates of non-first-time and half-time certificate- or degree-seeking undergraduate students. The bill also sets forth new time periods for calculating the completion or graduation rates for programs of study that are less than four years.</summary>
