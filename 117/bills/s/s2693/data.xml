This bill provides the Bureau of Reclamation with additional project authorities for the Salton Sea research project in Southern California and reauthorizes a Department of Interior pilot program in the Colorado River Basin.

Specifically, the bill authorizes Reclamation to provide grants and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements to carry out projects (e.g., construction activities and dust suppression projects) to improve air quality, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and water quality in the area of the Salton Sea.

To carry out these projects, Reclamation may enter into partnerships with state, tribal, and local governments; water districts; joint powers authorities, including the Salton Sea Authority; nonprofit organizations; and institutions of higher education.

The bill also reauthorizes Interior to fund or participate in pilot projects to increase Colorado River System water in Lake Mead and the Colorado River Storage Project reservoirs through FY2026.

The bill further requires Interior to submit an updated report to Congress by the end of FY2027 on the effectiveness of the pilot projects and a recommendation on whether to continue the program.</summary>
