  <summary date="2021-05-18T13:51:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to secure critical supplies to combat COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

In securing these supplies, HHS must coordinate with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.

HHS may also use authorities available under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to secure supplies. That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industries to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.</summary>
