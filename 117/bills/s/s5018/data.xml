  <summary date="2022-10-26T13:16:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act

This bill restricts funding to an institution of higher education (IHE) that has a relationship with a Chinese entity of concern or Confucius Institute. A Confucius Institute is a cultural institute directly or indirectly funded by the Chinese government.

Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must ensure that an IHE that has awarded a contract to, entered into an agreement with, or received an in-kind donation or gift from a Chinese entity of concern or Confucius Institute is ineligible to receive specified funds from DHS. The IHE may regain eligibility for these funds if it terminates the relationship.</summary>
