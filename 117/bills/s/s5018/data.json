A Confucius Institute is a cultural institute directly or indirectly funded by the Chinese government.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must ensure that an IHE that has awarded a contract to, entered into an agreement with, or received an in-kind donation or gift from a Chinese entity of concern or Confucius Institute is ineligible to receive specified funds from DHS. The IHE may regain eligibility for these funds if it terminates the relationship."
