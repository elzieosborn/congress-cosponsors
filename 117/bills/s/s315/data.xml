  <summary date="2021-07-07T21:15:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Quality Care for Nursing Home Residents Act 

This bill establishes several requirements for Medicare skilled nursing facilities and Medicaid nursing facilities, including with respect to minimum staffing levels, protections for whistleblowers and residents, and training for nurses.

Specifically, the bill establishes minimum nurse-resident ratios for day, evening, and night shifts and prohibits facilities from retaliating against residents or staff who file complaints or cooperate in investigations; violators are subject to civil penalties. Facilities must also train nurses on their emergency procedures and on residents' rights.

The bill also requires specific consent procedures in relation to the administration of certain psychotropic drugs and prohibits the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements in such facilities.</summary>
