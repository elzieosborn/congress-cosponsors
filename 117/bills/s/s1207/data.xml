  <summary date="2021-10-04T10:26:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Community-Based Sentencing Alternatives for Caretakers Act of 2021

This bill requires sentencing courts to consider a community-based alternative sentence in the case of certain individuals who are caretakers (e.g., parents).

Current law sets forth seven factors that sentencing courts must consider when imposing a sentence.

This bill establishes a new, eighth factor that courts must consider when imposing a sentence on a caretaker for a nonviolent offense. Specifically, courts must consider a community-based alternative sentence, which is a sentence that may require the defendant to complete or participate in community-based programming, counseling, or treatment.</summary>
