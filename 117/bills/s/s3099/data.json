An independent assessment service that performs such work must annually report to GSA about any foreign interest in, influence of, or control of its service.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must publish a report that, among other requirements, includes an assessment of the costs incurred by agencies and cloud service providers related to the issuance of FedRAMP authorizations.\n\nThe bill establishes the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Committee."
