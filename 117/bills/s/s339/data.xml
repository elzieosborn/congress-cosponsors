This bill places fentanyl-related substances as a class into schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. A schedule I controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that has a high potential for abuse; has no currently accepted medical value; and is subject to regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act.

Additionally, the bill prohibits the application of a mandatory minimum prison term for certain drug offenses involving fentanyl-related substances.</summary>
