The FDA may condition reciprocal approval on the conduct of postmarket studies.\n\nThe FDA must issue a decision on whether to grant a request for reciprocal marketing approval within 30 days of receiving the request.\n\nCongress may pass a joint resolution to grant reciprocal marketing approval of a product that the FDA declines to approve through the reciprocal process."
