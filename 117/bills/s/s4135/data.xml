This bill dissolves the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Disinformation Governance Board and directs DHS to immediately remove its Executive Director.

The bill also prohibits the use of federal funds for the board's operation.

 Further, DHS (1) may not establish any entity equivalent to the board or authorize activities at DHS that are substantially similar to the board's activities, and (2) must submit to Congress a report describing the board's formation and all of the records in DHS's possession related to the board.</summary>
