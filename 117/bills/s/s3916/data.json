    "text": "Increasing Opportunities for Retail Investors Act \n\nThis bill expands the exemptions from registration requirements applicable to companies offering or selling securities. In general, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prohibits the offering or selling of securities unless the offering is registered with the SEC or it qualifies for an exemption.\n\nSpecifically, the bill increases the annual offering limit applicable to the crowdfunding exemption from $1 million to $5 million. The bill also allows the SEC to increase through rulemaking the dollar threshold or limit applicable to other types of offerings, including offerings for small- and medium-sized companies.\n\n Additionally, the bill increases the offering limit applicable to small securities offerings and provides for adjustments to this limit in line with inflation."
