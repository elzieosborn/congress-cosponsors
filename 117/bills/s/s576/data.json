Additionally, the Coast Guard must establish and maintain a database for collecting, archiving, and disseminating data on icebreaking operations and commercial vessel transit in the Great Lakes during ice season.\n\nThe bill also directs the Coast Guard to acquire a Great Lakes icebreaker that is at least as capable as Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress a report on the Coast Guard Great Lakes icebreaking program."
