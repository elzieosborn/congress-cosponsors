This bill supports research and development for connected technologies that advance precision agriculture.

In awarding grants under its sensor systems and networked systems programs, the National Science Foundation (NSF) shall consider certain research and development on sensor connectivity in environments of intermittent connectivity and intermittent computation.

The NSF must prioritize applications that incorporate distance learning tools and approaches in awarding grants under the Advanced Technological Education Program to (1) junior or community colleges to develop or improve associate degree or certificate programs in an in-demand industry sector or occupation; or (2) institutions of higher education partnering with private sector employers, industry partnerships, or sector partnerships that commit to offering apprenticeships, internships, research opportunities, or applied learning experiences to enrolled students.

The Government Accountability Office shall provide (1) a technology assessment of precision agriculture technologies; and (2) a review of federal programs that provide support for precision agriculture research, development, adoption, education, or training.</summary>
