This bill prohibits an act of Congress from containing any delegation of legislative powers, whether to any component within the legislative branch, the President or any other member of the executive branch, the judicial branch, any agency or quasi-public agency, any state or state instrumentality, or any other organization or individual.

The Government Accountability Office must identify to Congress all statutes enacted before 90 days after this bill's enactment that contain any delegation of legislative power.
