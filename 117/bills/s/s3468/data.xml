  <summary date="2022-08-01T13:07:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill prohibits rescinding the designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism without Congressional approval.

Specifically, before rescinding the designation, the President must certify to Congress that Cuba (1) is cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts, (2) has ceased providing support for international terrorism, (3) has rendered to the United States all persons sought by the Department of Justice for crimes committed in the United States, and (4) has ceased providing support to the regime of former President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. Furthermore, the designation may not be rescinded unless a joint resolution from Congress approving the President's certification is enacted.</summary>
