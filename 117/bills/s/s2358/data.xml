This bill allows states to pay a lower weekly Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation supplement to unemployed individuals until September 6, 2021, when the supplement is set to expire. Specifically, the bill allows a state to choose the weekly supplement amount that will be paid to qualified individuals, so long as the chosen amount is no greater than $300. Current law requires states to provide a $300 weekly supplement under the program.</summary>
