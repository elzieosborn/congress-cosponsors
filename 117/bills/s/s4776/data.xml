This bill transfers certain funds to the Department of Justice (DOJ) to carry out a grant program for school safety and security.

Specifically, the bill transfers funds appropriated for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements at public school facilities (currently known as the Department of Energy's Renew America's Schools Program) to DOJ for the grant program.

DOJ must award grants to states (and states must provide subgrants to eligible entities, such as local educational agencies and schools) for planning and designing school buildings and facilities, installing infrastructure, and implementing technology or other measures that strengthen security on school premises.</summary>
