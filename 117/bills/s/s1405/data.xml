Such activities include (1) causing significant excess greenhouse gas emissions associated with power generation; (2) causing significant or illegal deforestation or loss of natural carbon sinks; and (3) knowingly misrepresenting the environmental impact of a project, investment, or product.

The bill further states that it is U.S. policy to consider any act of corruption related to such activities and any violation of internationally recognized human rights committed against specified individuals to be sanctionable.</summary>
