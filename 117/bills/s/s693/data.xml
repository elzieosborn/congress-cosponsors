This bill makes a Member of Congress who has been convicted of a crime related to public corruption ineligible to receive retirement payments pursuant to the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System based on service as a Member. Under current law, a Member must forgo receipt of these payments only after a final conviction (i.e., after the exhaustion of all appeals under the judicial process).</summary>
