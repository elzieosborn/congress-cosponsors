This bill eliminates certain antitrust immunity for anticompetitive acts by ocean common carriers or marine terminal operators and allows the Department of Justice (DOJ), in addition to the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), to seek injunctive relief for anticompetitive acts by such carriers or operators.

The bill allows third parties to participate in civil actions brought by the FMC or DOJ against ocean carriers for anticompetitive harm. It also allows for punitive damages.</summary>
