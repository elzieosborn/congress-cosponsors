This bill temporarily establishes the Next Generation Telecommunications Council to advise Congress on sixth generation (6G) and other advanced wireless communications technologies.

Appointed members of the council may not have financial or personal interests in matters related to the council's duties.

These duties include reviewing past actions related to advancing wireless communications deployment. Additionally, the council must develop a strategy with recommendations on how the federal government can support, for example, the adoption of 6G and other advanced wireless communications technologies and the promotion of international cooperation with respect to those technologies. In developing the strategy, the council must consider issues including access to electromagnetic spectrum resources, workforce needs to support 6G deployment, and network security and resiliency.

The council terminates 120 days after submitting a final report that contains the strategy. Within 60 days of receiving that report, the Department of Commerce must submit to Congress an assessment with comments on the report's findings and recommendations.</summary>
