This bill addresses issues involving governmentwide executive councils.

Specifically, the bill provides statutory authority for the Office of Executive Councils (OEC), which resides within the General Services Administration (GSA) and assists governmentwide policymaking entities including the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, and the Performance Improvement Council. The OEC shall terminate six years after enactment.

Each council must (1) provide legislative, policy, project funding, or shared services recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the GSA related to the specific area of expertise of the council; and (2) serve as a primary advisory body to the OMB on the development and execution of the federal government performance plan and federal government priority goals.

Each council must publish a strategic plan, which shall be updated and affirmed at least every two years.

The Chair of the Chief Data Officer Council shall be the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government.

The GSA shall provide administrative and other support for various councils.</summary>
