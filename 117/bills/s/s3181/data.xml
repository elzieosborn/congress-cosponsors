  <summary date="2022-07-19T14:39:50Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Enforcement Act

This bill establishes statutory prohibitions, investigatory mechanisms, and enforcement provisions regarding the receipt from a foreign or domestic government of profits, gains, advantages, or payments (i.e., emoluments) by U.S. officeholders.

Specifically, the bill prohibits any U.S. officeholder from accepting, directly or indirectly, emoluments from a foreign government without consent of Congress. The prohibition is enforceable through a civil action filed by the House of Representatives or Senate.

Additionally, the bill prohibits the President from accepting emoluments from a domestic government other than compensation for his or her services as President.

Both foreign and domestic emolument prohibitions are enforceable through administrative fines and civil actions by the Office of Government Ethics. The Office of Special Counsel must investigate violations of the bill.</summary>
