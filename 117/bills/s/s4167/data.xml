This bill addresses federal agency performance and accountability.

Specifically, the bill revises requirements regarding strategic reviews of federal agencies' performance goals and requires a Deputy Performance Improvement Officer to support the Performance Improvement Officer.

With respect to strategic reviews, not less frequently than annually and consistent with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget, each agency must take specified actions, including

 for each goal or objective established in the agency's strategic plan, review the progress achieved toward the goal and the likelihood that the agency will achieve the goal; identify any risks or impediments that would decrease the likelihood that the agency will achieve the goal; and for each goal at greatest risk of not being achieved, identify prospects and strategies for performance improvement. Additionally, the bill requires that federal government priority goals (1) be updated and revised not less frequently than during the first year of each presidential term, (2) include plans for the successful achievement of each goal within each single presidential term, and (3) explicitly cite to any specific contents of the budget that support the achievement of each goal.</summary>
