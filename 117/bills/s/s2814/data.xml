This bill establishes pricing for insulin and injectable epinephrine provided at federally qualified health centers (community-based health providers in underserved areas) that participate in the 340B drug pricing program.

Specifically, such centers must provide insulin and injectable epinephrine at or below the price paid by the center, plus a minimal administration fee, to patients with a household income that is not more than 350% of the federal poverty level and who either

 have a health insurance plan with a cost-sharing requirement of more than 20% of the total amount charged for such drugs, have a high unmet deductible under a health insurance plan, or do not have a health insurance plan.</summary>
