This bill requires the Department of Defense to implement a pilot program to provide grants for eligible entities to supplement the Transition Assistance Program by providing job opportunities for industry-recognized certifications, job placement assistance, and related employment services.

Eligible entities are those that (1) follow a job training and placement model; (2) have a well-developed and rigorous practice of program measurement and evaluation; (3) have established partnerships with entities to provide the necessary services; and (4) have online training capability to reach rural veterans, reduce costs, and comply with new conditions forced by COVID-19.

The program must be implemented at five military installations in the United States with successful economic opportunity program models.</summary>
