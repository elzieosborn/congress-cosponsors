ILCs are state chartered institutions owned by nonfinancial businesses (parent companies) that provide several services similar to banks, such as originating loans and processing payments. The parent companies are not subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Under current law, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may grant deposit insurance to these institutions."
