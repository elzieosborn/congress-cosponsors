This bill (1) provides for the federal regulation and supervision of industrial banks, also known as industrial loan companies (ILCs), and their parent companies; and (2) sets forth a deadline for the consideration of pending ILC Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance applications. ILCs are state chartered institutions owned by nonfinancial businesses (parent companies) that provide several services similar to banks, such as originating loans and processing payments. The parent companies are not subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Under current law, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) may grant deposit insurance to these institutions.</summary>
