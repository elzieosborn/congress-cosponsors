  <summary date="2021-11-02T19:50:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Pharmacy DIR Reform To Reduce Senior Drug Costs Act

This bill establishes certain requirements for prescription drug plans and the prices of covered drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit.

Specifically, the bill requires price concessions, payments, and fees that are negotiated with a pharmacy to be included in a drug's negotiated price, excluding incentive payments, and for this price to be provided at the point of sale. Additionally, prescription drug plans must report price concessions or incentive payments that are made after payment for covered drugs at the point of sale, including by contracted intermediaries, to the pharmacy at least annually.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must establish standardized pharmacy performance measures with respect to incentive payments and price concessions; such measures must account for all pharmacy types, including specialty pharmacies, and focus on patient health outcomes and other targeted areas.</summary>
