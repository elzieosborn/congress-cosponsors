This bill broadens the authority for certain law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms across state lines.

Specifically, the bill allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition (including magazines) in school zones; in national parks; on state, local, or private property that is open to the public; and in certain federal facilities that are open to the public.

Further, the bill permits states to reduce the frequency with which retired law enforcement officers must meet certain qualification standards.</summary>
