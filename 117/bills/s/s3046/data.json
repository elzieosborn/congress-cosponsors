For purposes of a civil action relating to such a project, any person that participated in the collaborative process to develop the proposal for the project shall be (1) entitled to intervene, as of right, in any subsequent civil action; and (2) considered to be a full participant in any settlement negotiation relating to the project.\n\nThe authority to enter into an agreement and the requirement to maintain a list of contractors shall expire on January 1, 2033."
