This bill authorizes the granting of an occupancy license to any person who requests access to a right-of-way that is owned by the federal government in order to place, construct, modify, or operate facilities for the provision of broadband service.

Specifically, an executive agency with control over such a right-of-way may grant an occupancy license for the expansion of broadband service. An occupancy license may not have a duration of more than 30 years and may be automatically renewed. The granting agency must establish an annual license fee and make a decision regarding the issuance of the occupancy license within 60 days of receiving an application for a license. If the agency does not act on a request within 60 days, the application shall be considered granted.</summary>
