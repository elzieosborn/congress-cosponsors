An occupancy license may not have a duration of more than 30 years and may be automatically renewed. The granting agency must establish an annual license fee and make a decision regarding the issuance of the occupancy license within 60 days of receiving an application for a license. If the agency does not act on a request within 60 days, the application shall be considered granted."
