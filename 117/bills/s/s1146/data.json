(The MTCR is an informal political understanding among states that seek to limit the proliferation of missiles and missile technology.)\n\n The bill also requires the Department of State and the Department of Energy to submit a report on MTCR compliance and a strategy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles in the Middle East."
