The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must assess the National Quantum Initiative Program and report on its findings. Additionally, the GAO must brief Congress on its assessment of the quantum information fellowship program established by this bill.\n\nThe President must establish, through the National Science and Technology Council, a temporary Subcommittee on the Economic and Security Implications of Quantum Science.\n\nThe National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee must include defense researchers and ensure the integration of DOD in committee actions and programs."
