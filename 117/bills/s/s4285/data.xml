  <summary date="2022-12-01T17:50:14Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Upholding the Inter-American Democratic Charter Act of 2022

This bill requires the Department of State to develop and implement a strategy to uphold and strengthen the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which states that the peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.

The charter was adopted in 2001 by the member states of the Organization of American States (OAS), which includes all 35 independent countries of the Western Hemisphere.

The strategy must include plans to (1) strengthen the integrity of electoral processes in the Americas; (2) counter the spread and amplification of disinformation and misinformation in the Americas; and (3) address threats to democratic governance posed by corruption, criminality, and the malign activities of nondemocratic and non-OAS countries such as China and Russia.</summary>
