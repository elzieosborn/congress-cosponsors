In addition, the bill provides FY2023 appropriations for\n\n the Capitol Police; the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights; the Congressional Budget Office; the Architect of the Capitol; the Library of Congress, including the Congressional Research Service and the Copyright Office; the Government Publishing Office; the Government Accountability Office; Congressional Office for International Leadership Fund; and the John C.
