The VA is prohibited from (1) denying an application for a grant solely on the basis that the recipient state may use funds to expand, improve, operate, or maintain a veterans' cemetery in which interment of the specified individuals is allowed; and (2) enforcing certain conditions on grants for state veterans' cemeteries that were established before the date of enactment of this bill.\n\nThe bill also provides for plot allowances for the burial of veterans at cemeteries that allow the internment of individuals listed in the bill, including on trust land owned by or held in trust for a tribal organization."
