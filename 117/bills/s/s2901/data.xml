This bill tasks the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) with various activities to promote the availability of high-quality recovery housing for individuals with substance use disorders. Recovery housing refers to shared living environments free from alcohol and illicit drug use and centered on peer support and connection to services that promote sustained recovery from substance use disorders.

Specifically, SAMHSA must

 develop and publish on its website standards and guidelines for recovery housing; award grants to states, tribal nations, territories, and localities to implement such standards and guidelines; convene an interagency working group to coordinate federal activities related to recovery housing; and arrange for research on the supply, quality, and effectiveness of recovery housing.</summary>
