The NBACC must\n\n engage in a continuously operating Work for Others program to make the unique biocontainment and bioforensic capabilities of the NBACC available to other federal agencies; and perform regularly scheduled and required maintenance of laboratory infrastructure, and procure mission-critical equipment and capability upgrades.
