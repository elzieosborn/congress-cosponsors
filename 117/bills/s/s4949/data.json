Such allowance is only authorized if a plot or interment allowance was not already paid for the burial of such veteran.\n\nThe act also authorizes the VA to designate green burial sections in national cemeteries (i.e., sections of cemeteries in which the remains of individuals have been prepared for interment in a manner not involving chemicals or embalming fluids and have been interred in a natural manner or completely biodegradable burial receptacle).\n\nThe act authorizes the Department of the Army to transfer certain lands to the VA to expand the Fort Bliss National Cemetery.\n\nIn addition, the act authorizes the Department of the Interior to transfer certain land to the VA for the land to be used as a national cemetery.\n\nFinally, the act prohibits persons who have committed certain crimes from being interred or memorialized in a cemetery in the National Cemetery Administration or in Arlington National Cemetery."
