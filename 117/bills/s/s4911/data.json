An individual may not be appointed to such a position more than once.\n\nOPM must set forth the criteria for certifying an individual as a high-performing employee in a former position based on (1) the individual's final performance appraisal in that former position, and (2) a recommendation by the individual's immediate or other supervisor in that position."
