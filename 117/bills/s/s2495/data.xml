  <summary date="2022-07-25T18:33:53Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Protecting our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain from China Act of 2021 

This bill requires the federal government to maintain a registry of certain foreign-sourced drugs, prohibits federal health care programs from purchasing drugs containing ingredients manufactured in China, requires drugs to be labeled for country of origin, and offers domestic manufacturing facility tax incentives.

The Food and Drug Administration shall maintain (1) a list of foreign-sourced drugs and active ingredients that are critical for consumer health and safety, and (2) another list identifying such drugs that are produced exclusively in China or use ingredients produced in China.

The bill phases in a restriction on federal health care programs purchasing drugs with active ingredients manufactured in China. By January 1, 2024, such programs may not purchase a drug with any active ingredients from China. The Department of Health and Human Services may issue a waiver for an agency or program that is unable to meet this requirement, but no waiver may apply to drugs purchased in or after 2026.

Each drug must have labeling listing the country of origin of each active ingredient, and a drug without this labeling shall be deemed misbranded.

The bill allows 100% tax expensing for qualified pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing property placed in service between 2020 and 2026.</summary>
