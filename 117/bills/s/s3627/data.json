    "text": "Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange Act or the DELETE Act This bill establishes a process for the deletion of personal information held by data brokers (i.e., entities that collect or obtain personal information for commercial purposes from individuals with whom they do not have a direct relationship). First, it requires the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules requiring data brokers to (1) register with the commission, (2) provide specified contact information, and (3) disclose certain data collection practices. Second, the commission must establish a centralized system to allow individuals to make a single request for the deletion of any of their personal information held by a data broker (or an affiliated legal entity). Each data broker must delete the personal information not later than 31 days after a request is made. An individual who submits a deletion request also must be added to a do-not-track list and registered data brokers are prohibited from collecting personal information about that individual. The bill provides for enforcement of these requirements by the commission."
