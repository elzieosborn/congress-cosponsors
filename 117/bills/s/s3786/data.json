It also prohibits the importation of energy products from Russia.\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes the President to proclaim increases in the rates of duty applicable to products of Russia or Belarus. This authority terminates on January 1, 2024. The President may restore normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, subject to congressional disapproval.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits the importation of Russian products that are classified under chapter 27 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (which includes mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation, bituminous substances, and mineral waxes).\n\nThe bill directs the U.S. Trade Representative to take certain actions, including to consider steps to suspend Russia's participation in the World Trade Organization and seek to halt the accession process of Belarus."
