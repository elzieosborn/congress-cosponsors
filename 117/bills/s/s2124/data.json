(Similar restrictions have historically been included in annual appropriations measures.)\n\nSpecifically, an agency may not award a contract for the procurement of property or services (including a defense contract) to (1) any foreign incorporated entity determined to be an inverted domestic corporation or any subsidiary of such entity, or (2) any joint venture more than 10% of which is held by such an entity or subsidiary.\n\n An inverted domestic corporation is a company that was previously incorporated in the United States or was a partnership in the United States but is now incorporated in a foreign country despite (1) a majority of the company being owned by the owners of the former domestic entity, or (2) management of the company primarily occurring in the United States."
