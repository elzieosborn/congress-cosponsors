This bill addresses the maintenance of the GI Bill Comparison Tool and administration of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance.

The VA must maintain the tool and ensure its historical data remains easily and prominently accessible on the VA's benefits website for at least seven years from the initial publication.

The VA must retain, maintain, and publish feedback from students and state approving agencies regarding the quality of instruction, recruiting practices, and post-graduation employment placement of approved institutions of higher learning for the duration that the institution is approved for VA benefit purposes.

The bill provides institutions of higher learning with up to 30 days to review and respond to any feedback and address issues before the feedback is published.

The bill requires that the GI Bill Comparison Tool include updated information, including descriptions of each federal student aid program and the amount of educational assistance an individual may be eligible to receive under the program.

The VA must train personnel that provide education benefits counseling, vocational or transition assistance, or similar functions to properly use the comparison tool and provide appropriate education counseling services.

The VA must restore entitlement to educational assistance in situations where there is a civil enforcement action or VA action against an educational institution, and an individual was unable to complete the course or program of education due to such action. Individuals may be charged against their entitlement at their request.</summary>
