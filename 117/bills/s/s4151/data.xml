This bill increases criminal penalties for offenses relating to the manufacture of fentanyl or counterfeit substances. It also establishes requirements for federal agencies to address the use of counterfeit substances.

Specifically, the bill applies an increased criminal penalty for possessing, manufacturing, or distributing certain equipment or materials that are used to illegally manufacture fentanyl, an analogue of fentanyl, or a counterfeit substance (the increased penalty is currently limited to offenses involving methamphetamine). The bill also requires the United States Sentencing Commission to review sentencing guidelines and amend them, if appropriate, to include an enhanced penalty for those who knowingly misrepresent counterfeit pills that have fentanyl, a fentanyl analogue, or methamphetamine as legitimate pills.

The Drug Enforcement Administration must establish and implement a plan to address counterfeit fentanyl or methamphetamine substances through law enforcement action and education and prevention efforts. In addition, the Department of Justice must annually report on the collection of counterfeit fentanyl or methamphetamine substances by law enforcement and on related prosecutions.</summary>
