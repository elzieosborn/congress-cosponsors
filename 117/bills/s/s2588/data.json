HHS must also contract with the National Academy of Medicine (or a similar entity) to conduct another study examining whether these harms increase the risk of suicide and substance use among pregnant and postpartum persons and other maternal health topics.\n\nThe bill also requires HHS to disseminate guidance on developing protocols and creating partnerships to address intimate partner violence and similar harms."
