This bill establishes additional statutory grounds for barring a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law) from admission into the United States, including for participating in female genital mutilation. The bill also addresses other issues, such as establishing the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center to coordinate efforts to bar foreign human rights abusers from entering the United States and support efforts to remove such individuals from the United States.</summary>
