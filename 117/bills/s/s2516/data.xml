  <summary date="2021-11-02T12:33:26Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill prohibits the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation from prohibiting or restricting the source of energy used by a power-generation project that has as its purpose the provision of affordable electricity in certain countries. Such countries are those that are eligible for support either solely from the International Development Association (IDA) or jointly from the IDA and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

Further, the corporation (1) may not reject a power-generation project in such a country based on the source of energy used by the project; and (2) must promote a technology- and fuel-neutral energy development strategy for such countries that includes the use of oil, natural gas, coal, hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal power and other sources of energy.</summary>
