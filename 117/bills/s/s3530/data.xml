This bill establishes a strategic reserve of rare earth metals and rare earth metal products and sets out other requirements related to rare earth metals.

Specifically, the bill requires defense contractors to disclose the provenance of rare earth metal permanent magnets and restricts the use of rare earth metals sourced from China in certain defense items and services.

Additionally, the U.S. Trade Representative must investigate China for unfair trade practices related to the rare earth metals market, and the Department of Defense must report on efforts to reduce the dependence of U.S. allies on non-allied sources of rare earth metals.</summary>
