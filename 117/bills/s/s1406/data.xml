This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct research regarding the installation and use of driver monitoring systems to minimize or eliminate driver distraction, driver disengagement, automation complacency, and the foreseeable misuse of advanced driver-assist systems.

DOT must also issue a final rule to establish performance standards for driver monitoring systems and require those systems to be installed on all new passenger motor vehicles. It must incorporate privacy and data security safeguards in the rule.</summary>
