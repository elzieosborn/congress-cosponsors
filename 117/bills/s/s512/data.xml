  <summary date="2021-06-04T13:46:56Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act of 2021

This bill expands data collection and reporting on demographic information and disparities related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

During the COVID-19 emergency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must publish data on COVID-19 testing, treatment, vaccinations, and outcomes on the&#160;CDC website. They must update the data daily and disaggregate it by race, ethnicity, and other demographic factors.

In addition, the Indian Health Service must consult with tribal nations about COVID-19 data collection and reporting.

The Department of Health and Human Services must make a summary of final statistics related to COVID-19 publicly available and report specified information to Congress within 60 days of the end of the COVID-19 emergency.

The bill also establishes the Commission on Ensuring Data for Health Equity. The commission must determine approaches to using data to reduce disparities in health outcomes, including specifically with respect to COVID-19. In addition, it must provide recommendations to improve demographic data collection and use in future public health emergencies.</summary>
