They must update the data daily and disaggregate it by race, ethnicity, and other demographic factors.\n\nIn addition, the Indian Health Service must consult with tribal nations about COVID-19 data collection and reporting.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must make a summary of final statistics related to COVID-19 publicly available and report specified information to Congress within 60 days of the end of the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nThe bill also establishes the Commission on Ensuring Data for Health Equity. The commission must determine approaches to using data to reduce disparities in health outcomes, including specifically with respect to COVID-19. In addition, it must provide recommendations to improve demographic data collection and use in future public health emergencies."
