This bill addresses immigration and border security issues.

For example, the bill (1) requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to resume all activities related to the construction of a border wall system along the U.S.-Mexico border that were planned or underway prior to January 20, 2021; (2) imposes limits on ending the policy commonly known as Title 42, a policy that authorizes DHS to suspend the entry of certain non-U.S. nationals or imports on public health grounds; and (3) requires DHS to ensure certain staffing levels for various agencies involved with immigration enforcement.</summary>
