This bill requires the Part D Senior Savings Model to be made permanent.

Currently, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services is testing a voluntary model under the Medicare prescription drug benefit (the Part D Senior Savings Model) in which the copayment for a month's supply of insulin is capped at $35 through participating plans. The model is set to expire on December 31, 2025.</summary>
