This bill prohibits the Federal Communications Commission from taking certain adverse actions against a radio or television station that advertises cannabis or hemp businesses or service providers if the station is licensed in a state where cannabis or hemp products are legal and other conditions are met. It also specifies that proceeds from transactions with legitimate businesses related to cannabis or hemp shall not be considered proceeds from an unlawful activity or require the denial of federal benefits.</summary>
