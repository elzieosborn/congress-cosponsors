The report must include foreign persons involved in such actions that occur inside or outside Iran.\n\nThe President must impose property-blocking sanctions on persons identified in the report, as well as visa-blocking sanctions on the identified individuals.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must submit to Congress a report identifying any foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts a significant transaction with a person sanctioned under this bill. Treasury may prohibit the opening, or prohibit or impose strict conditions on the maintaining of a U.S. correspondent account or a payable-through account by such a financial institution."
