    "text": "Head Start Improvement Act\n\nThis bill replaces the existing Head Start program with block grants to states and Indian tribes for prekindergarten (pre-K) education.\n\nInstead of providing direct financial assistance to Head Start agencies, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall allot block grant funds for pre-K education among eligible states and tribes in accordance with\u00a0their relative proportions of children, age three, four, or five, from low-income households.\u00a0Grant recipients\u00a0shall use the grant funds to (1)\u00a0award subgrants to eligible entities\u00a0that provide\u00a0pre-K education programs; (2) administer such programs; and (3) provide technical assistance, oversight, monitoring, research, and training.\n\nUnder current law, HHS is authorized to designate, monitor, and establish standards for\u00a0Head Start agencies. The bill instead shifts\u00a0pre-K program oversight and control\u00a0to states and tribes.\n\nIn addition, to the extent permitted under state law, grant recipients may use grant funds to establish (1) portable voucher systems that allow costs to be paid\u00a0for attendance at\u00a0private pre-K education programs; and (2) an education savings account that allows a parent of a low-income child to use a portion of the grant funds, or other available public or private funds added to the account, for expenses related to pre-K education.\n\nUnder current law, federal financial assistance for a Head Start program\u00a0is generally limited to\u00a080% of total program costs. The bill maintains this\u00a0limitation by\u00a0requiring grant recipients to provide matching funds equal to 20% of the grant amount."
