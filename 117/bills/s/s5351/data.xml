This bill makes an entity that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make or inform decisions liable for violations of civil rights laws caused by those decisions in the same manner and to the same extent as if the entity made the decision without using AI.

Additionally, the bill establishes a temporary program within the National Institute of Technology and Standards to evaluate AI systems for bias and discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, and other protected characteristics and assist in mitigating those effects. The program terminates on December 31, 2028.</summary>
