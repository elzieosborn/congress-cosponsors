    "text": "Empowering States to Deport Illegal Immigrants Act\n\nThis bill authorizes states to take actions to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes states to authorize state and local law enforcement to enforce certain provisions of federal immigration law, including provisions relating to unlawful entry and employing unauthorized non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law). State prosecutors\u00a0must prosecute every case brought by a state under this bill.\n\nThe bill also abrogates a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that invalidated an Arizona law that made it a crime for unauthorized non-U.S. nationals to work in the state. Specifically, the court ruled that the Arizona law was preempted by federal immigration law."
