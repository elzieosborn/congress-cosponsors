The analysis must address, among other matters, the cost of using public funding versus private financing.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Transportation must (1) report to Congress about the use of private financing for such transportation projects and the benefits of value-for-money analysis; and (2) issue guidance on performance benchmarks, risk premiums, and expected rates of return on private financing for transportation."
