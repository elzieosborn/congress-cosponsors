This bill revises requirements for obtaining a commercial driver's license.

The bill allows states to exempt employees in certain agriculture-related industries and employees of state, local, and tribal governmental entities from entry-level driver training requirements to obtain a commercial driver's license.

Additionally, a state may issue restricted commercial driver's licenses to owners and employees of certain small businesses, including those that employ not more than nine employees who hold a commercial driver's license as of the date on which the restricted commercial driver's license is issued.</summary>
