This bill makes changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Among other changes, the bill (1) allows a borrower who obtained an eligible Federal Direct Loan and has been employed full-time in public service (beginning on or after January 1, 1994) for 10 years or more to receive loan forgiveness under the PSLF program; (2) provides additional relevant definitions, including to specify that full-time employment is at least 30 hours a week; and (3) allows an eligible teacher to use the same teaching service to qualify for both the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program and the PSLF program.</summary>
