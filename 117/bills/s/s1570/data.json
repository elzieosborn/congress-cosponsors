    "text": "Human-Services Emergency Logistic Program Act of 2021 or the HELP Act of 2021\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to allot funding to states, tribal nations, and territories to improve the 2-1-1 and 9-8-8 telecommunication systems. The 2-1-1 system provides callers with information and referrals with respect to health and human services and other provider agencies, and the 9-8-8 system provides callers with mental health or suicide crisis support and resources through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\nThe funds must be used solely for making the call systems available to all individuals in the service area, enhancing community information and referrals with respect to human services, or both. As a condition of this funding, recipients must appoint a lead entity to manage activities to improve the call systems. Recipients must also establish a Human Services State Oversight Council to provide the lead entity with guidance and oversight related to the call systems.\n\nIn addition, HHS must establish a Human Services National Board, comprised of federal and non-federal representatives, to manage the allocation of funds and evaluate the call systems."
