This bill provides for programs and activities in support of forest restoration, wildfire mitigation, and energy resilience.

The Department of Agriculture (USDA) shall select landscape-scale forest restoration projects to implement on National Forest System land and on land adjoining National Forest System land. USDA shall establish a pilot program under which USDA may enter into conservation finance agreements with public or private persons to implement and monitor such projects.

The Department of Energy shall establish a program to support critical infrastructure and microgrids, including by improving the energy resilience and power needs of critical facilities (e.g., hospitals) through the use of microgrids, renewable energy, energy efficiency, reduced electricity demand, and on-site storage.

 USDA and the Department of the Interior shall establish one or more centers in western states to train individuals in methods relevant to the mitigation of wildfire risk.

 USDA shall establish a competitive grant program to support workforce development in forestry and fire management.</summary>
