    "text": "Unleashing American Innovators Act of 2022 \n\nThis bill modifies the responsibilities of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) satellite offices and addresses related issues.\n\nThe bill increases the discount on patent-related fees for small and micro entities. An entity that falsely claims such a discount shall be subject to a fine, in addition to any other existing penalties.\n\nThe bill also modifies the statutory purpose of PTO satellite offices to include (1) outreach activities targeting certain groups, such as low-income populations, veterans, and geographic groups that are underrepresented in patent filings; and (2) targeting patent examiners and administrative patent judges from economically, geographically, and demographically diverse backgrounds in the PTO's retention activities.\n\nFor each satellite office established after January 1, 2023, the PTO must consider the office's proximity to anchor institutions (e.g., hospitals primarily serving veterans and institutions of higher education) and certain groups, such as low-income populations, veterans, and geographic groups that are underrepresented in patent filings.\n\nThe PTO must establish (1) a satellite office in the southeastern United States within three years of this bill's enactment, (2) at least four community outreach offices throughout the United States within five years of this bill's enactment, and (3) a pilot program to help prospective first-time patent applicants assess the strengths and weaknesses of a potential patent application.\n\nThe PTO must also (1) conduct and report to Congress a study on patent pro bono programs, including whether such programs are sufficiently serving prospective and existing participants; and (2) use the study's findings to update such pro bono programs."
