The study must also assess potential cost effects, changes in out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, and effects on other federal programs.\n\nDOD must contract with a federally funded research and development center that is qualified and appropriate to conduct the study.\n\nAdditionally, DOD must brief Congress on the methodology and approach of the study and submit a report on the results."
