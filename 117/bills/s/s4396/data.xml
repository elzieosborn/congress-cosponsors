This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to study the feasibility of expanding eligibility for TRICARE Reserve Select and the TRICARE dental program to include all members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, their dependents, and their non-dependent children under the age of 26. The study must also assess potential cost effects, changes in out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, and effects on other federal programs.

DOD must contract with a federally funded research and development center that is qualified and appropriate to conduct the study.

Additionally, DOD must brief Congress on the methodology and approach of the study and submit a report on the results.</summary>
