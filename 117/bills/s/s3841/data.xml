This bill requires U.S. representatives to the United Nations to instruct the U.N.'s Department of Peace Operations (DPO) to (1) direct peacekeepers from Russia to depart from all U.N. peacekeeping missions, and (2) terminate contracts with Russian individuals and entities. If the DPO has not complied with these instructions within a certain time period, the Department of State must withhold funds from the DPO until there is compliance.</summary>
