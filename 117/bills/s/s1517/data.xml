This bill prohibits using federal funds for facilities used to detain noncitizen families and addresses related issues.

Specifically, no funds made available may be used to operate or construct a family detention center, whether operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or a contractor. This prohibition shall also apply to funds made available before this bill's enactment.

Funds obligated to operate such centers must instead be used for implementing and developing nondetention programs that are community-based and consistent with international best practices.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may place an apprehended noncitizen family into such a nondetention program if DHS makes an individualized determination that doing so will facilitate the family's compliance with immigration laws. The programs must provide to participants a legal orientation and meaningful access to counsel.</summary>
