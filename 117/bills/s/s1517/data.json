This prohibition shall also apply to funds made available before this bill's enactment.\n\nFunds obligated to operate such centers must instead be used for implementing and developing nondetention programs that are community-based and consistent with international best practices.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may place an apprehended noncitizen family into such a nondetention program if DHS makes an individualized determination that doing so will facilitate the family's compliance with immigration laws. The programs must provide to participants a legal orientation and meaningful access to counsel."
