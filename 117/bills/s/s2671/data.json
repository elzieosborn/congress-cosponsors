It also prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to campaigns related to ballot initiatives and referenda.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission (FEC) must conduct an audit after each federal election cycle to determine the incidence of illicit foreign money.\n\nNext, the bill makes it unlawful to establish or use a corporation, company, or other entity with the intent to conceal an election contribution or donation by a foreign national. A violator is subject to criminal penalties\u2014a fine, a prison term of up to five years, or both.\n\n Covered organizations (e.g., corporations, labor organizations, and political organizations) must, within 24 hours, file reports with the FEC to disclose campaign expenditures of more than $10,000 during an election cycle."
