This bill requires the Department of State to report to Congress a strategy for the safe processing abroad of nationals of Afghanistan applying for admission as refugees or special immigrant visas based on the applicant's work in support of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.

The strategy must include various elements, including detailed plans for (1) prioritizing the processing of such individuals, (2) providing security checks for such individuals, (3) facilitating the rapid departure of such individuals from Afghanistan after the security checks, and (4) engaging with other countries to better facilitate the evacuation of such individuals.

The State Department must also report monthly to Congress on the progress of efforts to implement the strategy.</summary>
