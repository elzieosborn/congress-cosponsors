This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to establish a grant program and a student loan forgiveness program to increase the number of school-based mental health services providers in elementary and secondary schools.

First, ED must award grants to partnerships between educational agencies and graduate institutions&#160;to increase the number of school-based mental health services providers employed by low-income local educational agencies (LEAs). Grant funds may be used for specified purposes, including to provide student loan forgiveness and tuition credits and to support recruitment, hiring, and training.

In addition, ED must establish a program to provide student loan forgiveness for individuals who (1)&#160;are not, and have never been, participants in the grant program established by the bill; and (2) have been employed by low-income&#160;LEAs&#160;for five or more consecutive school years as mental health services providers.</summary>
