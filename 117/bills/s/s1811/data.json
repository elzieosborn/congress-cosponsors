Grant funds may be used for specified purposes, including to provide student loan forgiveness and tuition credits and to support recruitment, hiring, and training.\n\nIn addition, ED must establish a program to provide student loan forgiveness for individuals who (1)\u00a0are not, and have never been, participants in the grant program established by the bill; and (2) have been employed by low-income\u00a0LEAs\u00a0for five or more consecutive school years as mental health services providers."
