  <summary date="2021-05-06T14:29:25Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act 

This bill expands the definition of crude oil for purposes of the excise tax on petroleum and petroleum products to include any bitumen or bituminous mixture, any oil derived from a bitumen or bituminous mixture (tar sands), and any oil derived from kerogen-bearing sources (oil shale).

The bill also authorizes the Department of the Treasury&#160;to&#160;classify as crude oil or as a petroleum product subject to such tax any fuel feedstock or finished fuel product transported by pipeline, vessel, railcar, or tanker truck if (1) such classification is consistent with the definition of oil under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and (2) such fuel feedstock or finished fuel product is produced in sufficient commercial quantities as to pose a significant risk of hazard in the event of a discharge.</summary>
