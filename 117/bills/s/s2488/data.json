    "text": "Suicide and Crisis Outreach Prevention Enhancement Act\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2026 and otherwise revises the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline program by expanding program activities and placing requirements on telecommunications carriers. The program provides free and confidential support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress through either a nationwide three-digit or toll-free telephone number.\n\nExpanded activities include increasing the program's capacity to provide prevention and intervention services, carrying out public awareness and outreach about the program, and collecting data on disparities in accessing the program and among individuals seeking help.\n\nFurthermore, telecommunications carriers must transmit any calls made to the program to the caller's local crisis center. They must also transmit the call, if transferred by the local crisis center, to the applicable local emergency service, mental health resource, or similar support. The bill also prohibits telecommunications carriers from deducting minutes from a caller's pre-paid phone plan for calls made to the program."
