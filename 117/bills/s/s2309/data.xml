  <summary date="2022-08-04T14:39:38Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill expands eligibility for and modifies grants available through the Department of Transportation for improving the safety, efficiency, and reliability of passenger and freight rail transportation systems.

Specifically, the bill makes the District of Columbia, certain associations that represent railroads, and Indian tribes eligible for the grants. Other modifications include allowing grants to fund additional types of projects, such as (1) measures to prevent trespassing to reduce associated injuries and fatalities; (2) modifications to locomotives that reduce emissions; and (3) research, development, and testing of electromagnetic guideways in a vacuum (e.g., the hyperloop).</summary>
