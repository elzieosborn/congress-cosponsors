This bill requires the President to impose sanctions related to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and addresses related issues. (Nord Stream 2 is a pipeline that would increase Russia's natural gas export capacity directly to Germany.)

Specifically, the President must impose property-blocking sanctions on any entity established for or responsible for the planning, construction, or operation of Nord Stream 2. The President must also impose visa-blocking sanctions on any corporate officers of such an entity.

The bill also requires the President to report to Congress before waiving certain sanctions related to Russia. If Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval after receiving the report, the President may not waive the sanctions.</summary>
