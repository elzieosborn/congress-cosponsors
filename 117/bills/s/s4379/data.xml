This bill establishes a special rule for members of the National Guard, for purposes of retirement pay, to include in the regular calculation of creditable service state active duty that would normally be credited with fewer than 50 points. Specifically, a member of the National Guard may be credited one point for each day of state active duty during a one-year period, subject to certain limitations.</summary>
