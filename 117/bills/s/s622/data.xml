  <summary date="2021-11-17T17:40:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act of 2021

This bill revises the definition of qualifying advanced energy project for purposes of the tax credit for such project. Specifically, the bill expands the definition to include property designed to produce energy from water, property designed to produce energy conservation technologies, light-, medium-, or heavy-duty electric or fuel cell vehicles, certain hybrid vehicles, and manufacturing facilities designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The definition also includes projects located in a census tract in which a coal mine closed after 1999 and in which a coal-fired electric generating unit was retired after 2009, and provides additional credit allocations for projects to retool, expand, or build new facilities that make or recycle energy-related products, and for projects in communities where coal mines have closed or coal-fired electric units have been retired.</summary>
