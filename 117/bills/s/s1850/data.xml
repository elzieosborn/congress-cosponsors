This bill authorizes the National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces (NCMAF) to update and make corrections to certain memorials in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

Specifically, NCMAF may

 update the memorial to Protestant chaplains with a granite, marble or other stone base to host the bronze plaque of the memorial; add another plaque to such base that includes the name of each chaplain who died while on active duty since the original memorial was placed; make updates and corrections to the memorials to Catholic chaplains and Jewish chaplains as needed; and make other updates as needed. Additionally, NCMAF is authorized to verify the names of chaplains with their respective military branch for memorialization in Arlington National Cemetery.</summary>
