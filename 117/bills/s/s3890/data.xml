This bill addresses intergovernmental cooperation and duplicative spending in federal programs.

Specifically, the bill authorizes the President to prescribe information technology products and platforms and other similar or supporting services that an executive agency is especially competent and authorized by law to provide.

Further, it requires an executive agency, when providing services prescribed by the President to a state, local, territorial, or tribal government, to take all available necessary and appropriate steps to increase cooperation and reduce administrative burden between the state, local, territorial, or tribal government requesting the service and the agency.

Additionally, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in coordination with the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, must publish a strategic plan to improve cooperation between and support greater harmonization, effectiveness, and the reduction of burdens and costs between the federal government and state, local, territorial, and tribal governments.

The OMB must (1) issue guidance implementing these provisions, and (2) report on actions and activities taken by executive agencies in this regard.

The General Services Administration may provide specified specialized or technical services to a state, local, territorial, or tribal government.</summary>
