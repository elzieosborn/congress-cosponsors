  <summary date="2022-10-19T14:13:06Z" status="Public Law">Maximizing Outcomes through Better Investments in Lifesaving Equipment for (MOBILE) Health Care Act

This bill allows a health center that currently receives funding through a Health Resources &amp; Services Administration Health Center Program grant to use a New Access Point grant to set up a mobile unit regardless of whether the health center also establishes a permanent health care delivery site.

New Access Point grants help health centers establish new delivery sites to provide comprehensive primary care to medically underserved populations. Under current law, health centers may only use the grants to set up a mobile unit if they also establish a permanent site.</summary>
