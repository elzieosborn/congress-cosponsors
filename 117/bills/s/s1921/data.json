The institute must invest in clean energy science, climate science, innovation, and research and development to reduce emissions and build climate resilience. In addition, the institute must support (1) clean energy research areas; (2) research and development projects focusing on the impacts of energy production in certain communities that have been disproportionately impacted by environmental injustices; and (3) research and development projects focused on impacts of clean energy and energy production on job loss, job creation, and workforce development, particularly in heavily unionized workforce sectors."
