This bill establishes new requirements related to grants, programs, and reports to improve the treatment and care of pregnant and postpartum women who are incarcerated.

Specifically, the bill requires the following:

 states must restrict the use of restraints on pregnant women in prison in order to receive full funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program; the Bureau of Prisons must establish programs to optimize maternal health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women in federal prisons; the Bureau of Justice Assistance must award state grants for programs to support pregnant and postpartum women in state and local prisons and jails; the Government Accountability Office must report on adverse maternal and infant health outcomes among incarcerated individuals and infants born to such individuals, with a particular focus on racial and ethnic disparities; and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission must report on the impact of Medicaid ineligibility for pregnant and postpartum women in prison.</summary>
