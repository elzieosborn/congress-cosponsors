 This bill modifies the Bureau of Reclamation's Large-Scale Water Recycling Program, which provides grants to water and power delivery authorities in certain western states for the planning, design, and construction of large-scale water recycling and reuse projects that have a total cost of $500 million or more. Specifically, the bill removes the program's sunset provision and revises eligibility requirements.</summary>
