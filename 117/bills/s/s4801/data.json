It authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), state and local law enforcement, and airport law enforcement to carry out these activities.\n\nAdditionally, the bill allows DHS and the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Energy to contract with other entities to carry out C-UAS activities.\n\nThe bill also (1) expands the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center curriculum to include use of C-UAS authorities as well as the ability for state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement to attend such training; and (2) allows state, local, and airport law enforcement to use jamming technology to mitigate a drone threat."
