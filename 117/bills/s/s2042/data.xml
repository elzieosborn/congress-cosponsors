This bill revises the duties, membership, and reporting requirements of the Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise.

These changes include striking a requirement that the committee develop and promote new public sector programs and plans to foster women's business enterprise and, instead, requiring it to monitor the plans, programs, and operations of federal government departments and agencies to identify barriers to new business formation by women entrepreneurs.</summary>
