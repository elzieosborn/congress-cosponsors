This bill addresses the manufacturing of critical resources (e.g., supplies that are life-sustaining or otherwise critical to U.S. national security).

The bill establishes the Office of Supply Chain Preparedness within the Department of Commerce, the Supply Chain Advisory Council, and the National Manufacturing Guard within the office to be activated during a crisis to procure, manufacture, and distribute critical resources.

The office must establish the Supply Chain Data Exchange to account for critical resources, measure the manufacturing ability of industry partners, and plan the distribution of such resources.

The bill also establishes the Manufacturing Corps to provide workforce training for manufacturing skills deemed essential to the economic security of the United States.</summary>
