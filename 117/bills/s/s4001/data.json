Human Rights Council to convene a special session on Russia's human rights violations committed during its invasion of Ukraine, (2) opposing Russia's access to International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) systems, and (3) opposing financial assistance to Russia other than assistance that would support a core U.S. interest.\n\nThe bill also prohibits U.S. law enforcement and executive agencies from recognizing INTERPOL Red Notices issued by Russia.\n\n(INTERPOL is an international police organization that facilitates cooperation in law enforcement matters. A Red Notice is a request from an INTERPOL member state seeking the location and arrest of wanted persons for extradition or a similar action.)"
