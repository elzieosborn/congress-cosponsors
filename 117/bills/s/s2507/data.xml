This bill directs the Department of Justice to make grants for states to provide mental and behavioral health services to at-risk youth, including juveniles in secure detention facilities or secure correctional facilities in the state.

A state that receives a grant must (1) prohibit certain fees from being imposed on juvenile offenders or their parents or guardians; and (2) report, for inclusion in a national report, certain information about fines and fees imposed on adults and juveniles in the criminal justice system.</summary>
