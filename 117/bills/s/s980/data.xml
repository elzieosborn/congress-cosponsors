This bill prohibits a local educational agency (LEA) from receiving additional COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) relief funds while the LEA has remaining unobligated COVID-19 funds, unless the LEA submits and implements a plan to provide full-day, in-person instruction five days a week to all medically able students at its public schools.

An LEA may amend its plan for in-person instruction if it determines there is a significant rise in COVID-19 cases in the area in which it serves.

An LEA that fails to implement a plan within 14 days of approval must return funds to the state, and the state must return such funds to the Department of the Treasury.</summary>
