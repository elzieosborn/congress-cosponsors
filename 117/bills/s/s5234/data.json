The bill also expands the definition of major drug-transit country to include countries through which certain synthetic drugs are transported.\n\n(Under current law, a country designated a major illicit drug producing country or major drug-transit country may be eligible for certain U.S. foreign assistance, including transfers of excess defense articles. However, a designated country that fails to adhere to commitments related to drug control measures may be barred from receiving other forms of foreign assistance and may also be subject to trade restrictions.)"
