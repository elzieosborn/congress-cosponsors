In general, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prohibits the offering or selling of securities unless the offering is registered with the SEC or it qualifies for an exemption.\n\nThe bill defines a micro-offering as an aggregate amount of securities sold by an issuer that does not exceed $500,000 in a 12-month period. This exemption does not apply to issuers who are convicted of specified financial crimes or are subject to specified disciplinary actions."
