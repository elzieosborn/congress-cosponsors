(Current law authorizes but does not require leasing.)\n\nOther changes in the bill include (1) allowing Interior to delegate authority over certain federal permitting and other regulatory responsibilities for oil and gas leases to states; (2) exempting some oil and gas activities conducted on non-federal surface estates from certain permitting and environmental review requirements; and (3) requiring deference to state regulations, guidance, and permit requirements for all activities regarding hydraulic fracturing (a type of process used to extract underground energy resources) on federal land."
