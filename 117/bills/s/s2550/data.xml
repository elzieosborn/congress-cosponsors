This bill establishes&#160;requirements for institutions of higher education (IHEs) concerning students with disabilities.

Specifically, the bill requires IHEs to allow students to use certain documents, such as individualized education programs, to&#160;establish their disabilities.

In addition, IHEs must make the process for determining the eligibility for accommodations transparent.

Finally,&#160;IHEs must submit key data related to their undergraduate students with disabilities for inclusion in federal postsecondary institution data collection efforts.</summary>
