This bill requires certain actions to identify critical goods and establish minimum domestic content requirements.

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Commerce to publish an annual report that identifies finished and intermediate goods that are critical for U.S. national security or the protection of the industrial base.

Additionally, the bill establishes a minimum domestic content requirement for those covered goods identified in Commerce's report. A covered good may not be introduced for sale in the United States unless the domestic value content of the good is more than 50%, with limited exceptions. The President may waive this requirement under specified circumstances.

Further, the bill establishes enforcement provisions, including civil penalties and investigations by the U.S. International Trade Commission.</summary>
