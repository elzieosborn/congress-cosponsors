This bill authorizes employers and employees to establish voluntary employee involvement organizations to address matters of mutual interest within the workplace (e.g., productivity, compensation, benefits, recruitment, and retention).

Employee involvement organizations are not considered labor organizations under federal labor laws, and they do not constitute an unfair labor practice by an employer provided the employees are not already represented by a labor organization.</summary>
