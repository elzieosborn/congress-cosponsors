The bill defines underserved community to mean an historically disadvantaged community, including the Native American, African-American, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern and North African, and rural communities, as well as low-income and disability communities.\n\nThe bill establishes within the office a Disability Coordinator to ensure that the needs of disabled individuals are being addressed in emergency preparedness and disaster relief.\n\nThe office shall develop measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its activities aimed at reducing disparities in services provided to underserved communities.\n\nDuring the period of time for which there is a major disaster or emergency declared by the President with respect to COVID-19, the office shall regularly consult with state, local, territorial, and tribal government officials and community-based organizations from underserved communities that it identifies as disproportionately impacted by COVID-19."
