    "text": "Rebuilding Stronger Infrastructure Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to (1) revise the emergency relief manual of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), including by incorporating resilience into its emergency relief program; (2) develop best practices for improving the use of resilience in the program; (3) provide information on such best practices to the FHWA and states; and (4) develop and implement a process to track the consideration of resilience as part of emergency relief efforts and the costs of emergency relief products. (The emergency relief program provides funds for emergency and permanent repairs on federal-aid highways and roads that have suffered serious damage because of a natural disaster or catastrophic failure from an external cause.)\n\nThe total cost of a project funded under the emergency relief program may not exceed the cost of repair or reconstruction of a comparable facility unless DOT determines that the project incorporates economically justified betterments, including protective features to increase the resilience of the facility."
