This bill authorizes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to reclassify officers assigned to the tactical patrol unit on Tohono O'odham Nation land, commonly known as Shadow Wolves, as ICE special agents upon completing certain required training. Officers assigned to a comparable unit, regardless of location, may also be reclassified as ICE special agents upon completing the training and receiving the approval and consent of the appropriate Indian tribe.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Government Accountability Office shall separately study and report on the best processes for expanding the Shadow Wolves program.</summary>
