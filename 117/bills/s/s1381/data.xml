This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to modify the E-rate program, which allots broadband discounts to schools and libraries.

Specifically, the FCC must modify the program to (1) expand the eligible activities that qualify as being for educational purposes, (2) deem certain households in which students are participating in distance learning and are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals to be classrooms, and (3) provide that a school's eligibility shall not be diminished if it extends services obtained through the program to households with a child who is eligible for free or reduced-price school meals.</summary>
