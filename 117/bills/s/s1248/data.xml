This bill establishes and provides funding for the Restoration and Resilience Grant Program and the Restoration and Resilience Partnership Program.

The bill establishes a Restoration Fund Advisory Council to provide advice to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) respecting the grant program.

The grant program shall provide grants to eligible entities (e.g., a state agency, a unit of local government, or a tribal government) for purposes such as (1) increasing the capacity for planning, coordinating, and monitoring restoration and resilience projects on federal land and nonfederal land; or (2) restoration and resilience projects on nonfederal land.

Under the Restoration and Resilience Partnership Program, USDA shall carry out restoration and resilience projects that reduce wildfire potential, improve community resilience in the wildland-urban interface, or restore wildlife habitat.</summary>
