    "text": "American Jobs Matter Act of 2021\n\nThis bill requires an executive agency to include the effects on employment within the United States (a jobs impact statement) in the evaluation factors that must be considered in each solicitation for competitive proposals for contracts in excess of $1 million for the procurement of (1) manufactured goods, (2) goods or services listed in a required report of industrial base capabilities, or (3) any item procured as part of a major defense acquisition program.\n\nAn agency must state in the solicitation for such competitive proposals that it will consider, as an evaluation factor, information included in an offer related to the effects on employment within the United States.\n\nEach agency must (1) annually assess the accuracy of such a statement submitted by an offeror awarded a contract, and (2) track the number of jobs created or retained during the performance of such contract. If the number of jobs created or retained falls short of agency estimates, an agency may consider this as a factor that affects a contractor's past performance in the award of future contracts.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) shall report annually on the frequency of use within DOD of jobs impact statements in the evaluation of competitive proposals.\n\nThe Department of Defense Supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation must be revised to implement this bill."
