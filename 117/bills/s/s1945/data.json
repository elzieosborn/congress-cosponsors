A recipient must use grant funds for certain activities, such as constructing or renovating facilities, carrying out major repairs, and strengthening the safety and security of a campus. Any new construction, modernization, or renovation projects must meet building code and energy and water conservation requirements.\n\nFurther, HBCUs must seek to procure contracts from certain small businesses, including those owned and controlled by veterans and service-disabled veterans.\n\nThe bill prohibits the use of grant funds for specified activities, including for the payment of routine and predictable maintenance costs, minor repairs, and utility bills.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must study the implementation of the grant program.\n\nThe bill also requires ED to repay the outstanding balance of principal, interest, fees, and costs and any related reimbursements for certain capital financing loans."
