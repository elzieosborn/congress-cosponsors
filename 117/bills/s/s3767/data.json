However, the federal share may be increased to 100% of the project's total cost if the grant recipient is unable to pay, or would experience significant financial hardship if required to pay, the nonfederal share.\n\nThe bill also repeals the prohibition on the use of program funds for the acquisition by the federal government of any interest in land."
