This bill provides statutory authority for, and establishes requirements regarding, the Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug pricing dashboards that are operated by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). The dashboards provide spending information for covered drugs, including the average spending per dosage unit and changes in spending over time.

The bill requires the CMS to update the dashboards annually and to include specified information, such as information about out-of-pocket costs and the drugs that have the highest total spending under each program.</summary>
