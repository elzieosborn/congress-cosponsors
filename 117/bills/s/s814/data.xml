  <summary date="2021-07-01T15:45:33Z" status="Reported to Senate">Ukraine Security Partnership Act of 2021

This bill contains provisions related to U.S. support for Ukraine.

From FY2022-FY2026, the Department of State is authorized to (1) provide grants and loans to Ukraine for acquiring U.S. defense equipment and services through the Foreign Military Financing program, and (2) provide training for Ukraine's military through the International Military Education and Training program. During this period, Ukraine shall have priority access to excess U.S. defense articles.

During this period, the State Department may also engage in certain activities in Ukraine to (1) strengthen cybersecurity and intellectual property enforcement, (2) provide support and training for certain economic reforms and the privatization of state-owned enterprises, (3) combat corruption and strengthen the rule of law, (4) respond to humanitarian crises caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, (5) improve participatory legislative processes, and (6) build civil society and independent media capacity.

The State Department shall report to Congress a strategy on (1) using diplomacy to support Ukraine, and (2) encouraging other countries to donate excess defense equipment to Ukraine. The President shall report to Congress a determination as to whether certain vessels and entities, including the project company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, meet the criteria to be subject to sanctions. (The Nord Stream 2 is a pipeline project that would bring natural gas from Russia to Europe.)</summary>
