    "text": "Vulnerable Road Users Safety Act\n\nThis bill addresses road safety, with a particular focus on the safety of vulnerable road users (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists, and users of scooters and other micromobility vehicles.)\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Highway Administration must implement specified recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to improve safety for vulnerable road users. Additionally, if a state experiences an increase in the rate of fatalities and injuries of vulnerable road users, it must prioritize in its highway safety improvement program the implementation of NTSB pedestrian safety recommendations.\n\nThe bill also requires the Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office of the Department of Transportation to incorporate bicyclists and other vulnerable road users into research concerning the safe deployment of connected vehicle systems (i.e., systems that use data from short-range communication broadcasts and exchanges with other vehicles to sense other vehicles and road users and identify potential hazards)."
