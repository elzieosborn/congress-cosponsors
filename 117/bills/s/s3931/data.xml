This bill expands the existing Securities and Exchange Commission registration exemption for securities that are part of an employee-compensation package. Specifically, the bill applies this exemption to securities provided to independent contractors performing work for the issuer and to customers of the issuer.

The bill also requires the corresponding aggregate sales amount to be indexed for inflation annually instead of every 5 years as under current law.</summary>
