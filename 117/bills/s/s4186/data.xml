This bill provides for monetary compensation to the victims of the prescribed fire burn in the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico that became a wildfire known as the Hermit's Peak Fire or the Hermit's Peak Fire/Calf Canyon Fire.

Each victim of the Hermit's Peak Fire shall be entitled to receive monetary compensation from the United States, including for personal injury, loss of property, business loss, or financial loss.

An Office of Hermit's Peak Fire Claims is established within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to receive, process, and pay claims to victims of the fire.

FEMA or the independent claims manager (which FEMA may appoint) shall, on behalf of the United States, investigate, consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, grant, deny, or settle any claim for money damages asserted by a victim of the Hermit's Peak Fire.

Any claimant aggrieved by a final decision of FEMA concerning compensation may, not later than 60 days after the date on which the decision is issued, bring a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, to modify or set aside the decision.</summary>
