It establishes enforcement goals of annual audits of certain high-income tax returns, beginning in 2025, and each year thereafter.\n\nThe bill establishes new reporting requirements for certain banks or other financial institutions and increases enforcement penalties for accuracy-related underpayments of tax up to a maximum of 40% of the underpayment for taxpayers with taxable incomes greater than $5 million.\n\nThe IRS must report to Congress biennially on plans to shift more of its enforcement assets toward high-income tax filers and on an estimate of revenue losses from offshore tax evasion."
