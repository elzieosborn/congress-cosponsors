  <summary date="2022-03-17T17:52:49Z" status="Public Law">Suicide Training and Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention Act of 2021 or the STANDUP Act of 2021

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), when awarding certain grants for priority mental-health needs, to give preference to state, tribal, and local educational agencies that plan to implement evidence-based suicide awareness and prevention training policies. HHS may also consider suicide rates in the applicable jurisdiction and other factors when awarding the grants.

In addition, HHS must coordinate with the Department of Education and the Department of the Interior to provide educational agencies with best practices for these training policies.</summary>
