Such criteria shall consider (1) the availability, validity, and accessibility of timely data; (2) the extent to which a project contributes to a family's financial security; and (3) the extent to which a project addresses child care needs in areas recognized as experiencing a child care shortage.\n\nCommerce must also issue guidance on how to include the accessibility of child care in a comprehensive economic development strategy."
