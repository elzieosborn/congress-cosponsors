    "text": "Transportation Empowerment Act\n\nThis bill limits federal support available through the Highway Trust Fund to highways and surface transportation systems designated as part of the Interstate System and correspondingly reduces the taxes on gasoline and other fuels that generate revenue for the fund. The bill phases in these changes over five years.\n\nIn addition, the bill\n\n eliminates various programs, such as the Congestion and Air Quality Mitigation Improvement Program, that currently receive funding through the Highway Trust Fund; removes requirements for states to comply with federal standards, environmental provisions, and related matters with respect to the design, construction, and maintenance of highways and surface transportation systems that are not part of the Interstate System; and transfers unobligated COVID-19 relief funding to the Highway Trust Fund for unpaid obligations incurred prior to the bill's enactment."
