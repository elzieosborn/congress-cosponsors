 This bill requires the Government Publishing Office (GPO) to establish and maintain a publicly available online portal containing copies of all congressionally mandated reports other than those required to be submitted to the House or Senate Committees on Intelligence, Armed Services, Appropriations, or Foreign Relations. A federal agency must submit a congressionally mandated report and specified information about the report to the GPO between 30 and 45 days after submission of the report to either chamber or to any congressional committee or subcommittee.

 Upon the written request of the chair of a congressional committee or subcommittee to the GPO, a report submitted to that committee or subcommittee shall not be submitted or published on the portal.

Federally chartered corporations, the Government Accountability Office, and any elements of the intelligence community are excluded from the requirements of this bill.

 The Office of Management and Budget must issue guidance to federal agencies on the bill's requirement for agencies to submit copies of congressionally mandated reports and related information to the GPO.</summary>
