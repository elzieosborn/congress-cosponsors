This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a web-based, interagency electronic information system to be known as DisasterAssistance.gov to provide for a universal disaster application across federal agencies.

Specifically, such system shall

 facilitate a consolidated application for any form of disaster assistance provided by a disaster assistance agency; carry out the purposes of disaster assistance programs swiftly, efficiently, equitably, and in accordance with specified laws and privacy and data protections; and support the detection, prevention, and investigation of waste, fraud, abuse, or discrimination in the administration of disaster assistance programs. DisasterAssistance.gov shall permit (1) applicants to receive status updates and update disaster assistance information throughout their recovery, and (2) the distribution of additional recovery resource information to survivors that may be available in a disaster stricken jurisdiction. Further, it shall provide disaster survivors with information and documentation on applications.

FEMA shall facilitate the collection of disaster assistance information into DisasterAssistance.gov only after (1) it certifies that the website substantially complies with specified data security standards and any other applicable federal information security policy, (2) the Department of Homeland Security publishes a privacy impact assessment, and (3) FEMA publishes standard rules of behavior for disaster assistance agencies and personnel to protect information from improper disclosure.

FEMA may certify a federal agency as a disaster assistance agency after posting an agreement that contains the detailed terms of the agreement.</summary>
