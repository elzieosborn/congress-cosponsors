This bill establishes an exception to the immunity of a provider of an interactive computer service (e.g., a social media company) from liability for screening and blocking offensive content on its platform.

Specifically, the bill removes this immunity from any provider that collects information regarding the habits, preferences, or beliefs of a user and utilizes an automated function to deliver content based on that information, unless the user knowingly and intentionally elects to receive such content.</summary>
