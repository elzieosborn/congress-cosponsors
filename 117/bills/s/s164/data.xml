  <summary date="2021-05-06T13:46:19Z" status="Public Law">Advancing Education on Biosimilars Act of 2021

This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to advance education and awareness among health care providers about biological products as appropriate, including by developing or improving continuing education programs that address the prescribing of biological products and biosimilars. (A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an FDA-approved reference biological product and has no clinically meaningful differences from that reference product.) The FDA may also maintain and operate a website to provide educational materials about biological products.</summary>
