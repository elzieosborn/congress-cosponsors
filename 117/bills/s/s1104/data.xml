This bill revises reporting and strategy requirements related to recovery and assistance efforts for Haiti.

Specifically, the bill repeals existing reporting and strategy requirements related to earthquake recovery and economic assistance for Haiti. Further, the bill directs the Department of State to undertake specific initiatives that prioritize and assess the protection and preservation of human rights, the promotion of press and assembly freedoms and the protection of journalists, anticorruption efforts, and a strategy of post-disaster and post-pandemic recovery and development efforts.

The State Department must also submit a report concerning the July 7, 2021, assassination of former Haitian President Jovenel Mo&#239;se.</summary>
