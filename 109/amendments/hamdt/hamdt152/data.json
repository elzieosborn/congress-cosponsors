  "number": 152,
  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 7 printed in part B of House Report 109-84 to make improvements to the Federal Flight Deck Officers (FFDO) Program including increasing access to initial and recurrent training for FFDO's by establishing qualification standards, exploring the possibility of alternate sites for training, and ensuring that the training be provided at no cost to the pilot. Also requires the Secretary to establish a secure means for TSA personnel to communicate with FFDO's in support of their mission, issue badges to FFDO's within 180 days, set up a process by which pilots can appeal a TSA decision to revoke a FFDO's status, establish a pilot program to allow FFDO's to carry their weapon, and encourage the President to pursue international agreements that will allow the use of FFDO's on international flights.",
