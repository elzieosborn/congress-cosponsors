  "introduced_at": "2006-06-27",
  "number": 1087,
  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 7 printed in House Report 109-530 to amend Section 16 of the bill to ensure that, when practical, FEMA utilizes emerging weather forecasting technologies in updating its flood maps. This will ensure that FEMA has the highest quality information when it works to determine the level of risk for vulnerable geographies. This language would not impose any additional financial mandates on the NFIP. It would just make sure the program has the best information possible, while emphasizing the importance of this emerging technology.",
