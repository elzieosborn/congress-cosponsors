  <description>Amendment allows flood insurance coverage to become effective immediately upon the purchase or transfer of real property for which coverage is provided without regard to the financial mechanism used to purchase such property.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 6 printed in House Report 109-530 to correct an inequity in current law by exempting all purchases or transfers of property by any means, and not just purchases via a loan as under current law, from the 30-day waiting period for purposes of flood insurance coverage.</purpose>
