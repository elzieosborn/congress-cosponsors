  <purpose>An amendment numbered 1 printed in House Report 109-249 to make technical changes to the section of the bill that sets out the types of information a plaintiff must provide to a judge to allow the court to determine whether the lawsuit should proceed or be dismissed; clarify that the pleading provision in H.R. 554 is meant to apply to all cases seeking obesity- related damages; add the phrase `for each defendant and cause of action' to clarify that a judge must apply H.R. 554's pleading requirements to each specific claim which prevents a plaintiff from improperly using a claim that is not barred by H.R. 554 as a means of pursuing obesity-related claims that are barred by H.R. 554 against the same or other defendants.</purpose>
