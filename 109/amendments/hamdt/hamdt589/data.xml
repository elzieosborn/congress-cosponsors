  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to replace the language of the bill with the text of the "Federal Response to Energy Emergencies Act of 2005".</description>
  <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in House Report 109-245 to give explicit authority to the FTC to define price gouging; to preserve the FTC's existing civil penalty authority and authorize new civil penalties of up to three times the amount of unjust profits gained by companies who engage in price gouging; and to increase our nation's refinery capacity by establishing a federal Strategic Refinery Reserve which would build upon the success of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by creating a natural extension of the SPR--a refinery reserve.</purpose>
