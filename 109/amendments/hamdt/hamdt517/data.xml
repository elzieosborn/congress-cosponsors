  <description>Amendment sought to require that 100 percent of the Civil Service Retirement System funds now in escrow be used to pay for the Postal Service's unfunded healthcare liability.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 3 printed in House Report 109-184 to reduce the bill's cost by ensuring that 100% of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) savings released under H.R. 22 will be directed to pay the Postal Service's unfunded healthcare liability, instead of it flowing to the Postal Service for its own use. In addition, the responsibility for paying the CSRS costs associated with military service credits will remain with the Postal Service instead of reverting back to the Treasury.</purpose>
