  "number": 458,
  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 5 printed in part B of House Report 109-175 to amend the Foreign Service Act to strengthen the statutory basis of the Department's requirement for worldwide availability for new entrants to the Foreign Service, and also to make clear that the Department's Office of Medical Services sets medical standards for admission to the Service's medical program. The amendment also allows each agency to continue to exercise its own hiring authority, and to utilize its discretion in situations where a Foreign Service applicant who is not worldwide available but nonetheless has skills that are so needed it is in the agency's best interests to waive the requirement.",
