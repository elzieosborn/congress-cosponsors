The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nCommends \"rights defense\" lawyers and activists of the People's Republic China (PRC) for their courage and integrity, and expresses moral support for this grass-roots rights defense movement in the PRC.\n\nUrges the government of the PRC to: (1) reinstate all licenses of Gao Zhisheng and his law firm; (2) remove all legal and political obstacles for lawyers attempting to defend criminal and politically sensitive cases in the PRC; (3) revise law and practice in the PRC to conform to international standards; and (4) allow religious believers in China to practice their religion without interference, and release Pastor Cai Zhuohua, his wife, and others imprisoned with him, and allow Pastor Cai to resume religious activities.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. government should support democracy and human rights programs in the PRC that strengthen protection of basic rights and freedoms, and should initiate programs to train lawyers, judges, academics, and students about international human rights law; (2) the U.S. government should seek grant proposals and fund programs to promote legal protections and cultural awareness of the right to freedom of religion or belief; and (3) the President should raise the issue of the PRC's harassment, arrest, and persecution of rights defense lawyers and activists and the need to respect the basic human rights of its citizens and the rule of law during his planned April 2006 meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao."
