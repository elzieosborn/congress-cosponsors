Recognizes that volunteer pilots in the federal flight deck officer program are consummate quiet professionals that embody what is best in our national character.

Applauds them for taking a stand against those who seek to harm the United States through acts of terrorism in the air.

Expresses appreciation to such pilots on behalf of all U.S. citizens for their ongoing contribution to the security of the Nation and its air transportation system.</summary>
