Security Council and all civilized nations to condemn Iran for: (1) violations of its nuclear nonproliferation obligations; and (2) its stated desire to use its nuclear capabilities to ensure Israel is \"wiped off the map\" and other anti-Semitic statements and policies.\n\n Demands that Iran halt all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development.\n\n Expresses support of the role of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its efforts to settle all remaining nonproliferation issues with respect to Iran.\n\n Calls on all Security Council members to remain focused on Iran's noncompliance with its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1696, and if such noncompliance continues to apply appropriate multilateral sanctions against Iran.\n\nCalls on the Bush administration to implement and exhaust every diplomatic and economic sanction at its disposal to ensure that the government of Iran abandons its nuclear activities and complies with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations."
