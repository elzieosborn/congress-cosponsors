Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) urge the Russian Federation to ensure full protection of freedoms for all religious communities and end governmental and security harassment of unregistered religious groups; (2) urge the Russian Federation to ensure that law enforcement officials investigate acts of violence against unregistered religious communities, as well as make certain that authorities are not complicit in such attacks; (3) continue to raise concerns with the government of the Russian Federation over violations of religious freedom, especially regarding indigenous denominations not well known in the United States; (4) ensure that U.S. embassy officials engage local officials throughout the Russian Federation, especially when violations of freedom of religion occur, and undertake outreach activities to educate local officials about the rights of unregistered religious communities; (5) urge both the Personal Representative of the OSCE Chair-in-Office on Combating Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination, also focusing on Intolerance and Discrimination against Christians and Members of Other Religions, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief to visit the Russian Federation and raise with federal and local officials concerns about the free practice of unregistered religious communities; and (6) urge the Council of Europe and its member countries to raise with Russian Federation officials issues relating to religious freedom.</summary>
