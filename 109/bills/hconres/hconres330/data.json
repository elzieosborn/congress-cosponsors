    "text": "Expresses deep concern that the President's 2002 order authorizing electronic surveillance of U.S. persons without a warrant violates existing law. Urges the President to rescind that order.\n\nNotes that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has proved to be an expeditious means of assuring approval of warrant requests and has responded favorably to nearly all warrant applications.\n\nReiterates support for maintaining a careful balance between national security and the privacy of Americans.\n\nUrges the President to: (1) report to Congress on the number of U.S. persons who were the subject of electronic surveillance without a warrant, the rationale for the selection of those persons for such surveillance instead of pursuing an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), and the plots or other terrorist actions that were defeated subsequent to the use of this authority; and (2) submit a request for legislation to Congress to amend FISA if the President considers that Act to be in need of reform."
