  <summary date="2005-03-08T22:50:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Condemns the arrest of Ayman Nour, the leader of the Al Ghad party, by the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt.

Calls on the Government of Egypt to release Ayman Nour, and to ensure that if tried, he and his deputy, Mousa Mustafa, be charged and tried in a regular criminal court and not a State Security or State Security Emergency Court.

Expresses support for: (1) the people of Egypt as they struggle for democracy; and (2) President George W. Bush's call for greater democracy in Egypt.

Encourages the President and the Secretary of State to assist human rights activists and the nonviolent democratic opposition in Egypt.

Urges the Secretary of State to reconsider her planned participation in the March 2005 G-8/Arab League ministerial meeting in Cairo on democracy and reform unless Ayman Nour is freed.</summary>
