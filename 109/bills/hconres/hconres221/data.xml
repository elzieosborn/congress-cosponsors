  <summary date="2005-08-29T19:46:36Z" status="Introduced in House">States that the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security should: (1) use every available tool to secure the borders against illegal entry; (2) seek state and local law enforcement assistance in enforcing immigration laws, whether through formal cooperation agreements or through the elimination of sanctuary policies; and (3) warn Mexico that any further actions it takes to encourage illegal immigration to the United States will be viewed as domestic interference in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.

States that the President should announce his opposition to granting legal status, or amnesty, to illegal aliens and that he and the Secretary will use every available tool to stop illegal immigration into the United States and to announce efforts to remove illegal aliens from the United States.</summary>
