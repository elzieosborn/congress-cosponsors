  <summary date="2005-10-14T20:47:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a voluntary moratorium on mortgage, small business, and consumer loans should be recognized by creditors for a 90-day period beginning on August 28, 2005, with respect to borrowers who resided in, or whose businesses were within, an area in which the President determined that a major disaster exists; (2) creditors should take into account the effect of this dislocation and provide flexibility to affected consumers when considering applications for new loans and credit accounts; (3) federal financial institution regulatory agencies should provide written guidance for financial institutions in implementing such a moratorium; and (4) creditors should refrain from negative reporting with respect to any such loans during this period.</summary>
