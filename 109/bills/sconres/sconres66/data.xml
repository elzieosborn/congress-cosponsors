  <summary date="2006-01-13T21:31:17Z" status="Introduced in Senate">States that: (1) in passing the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, Congress demonstrated its clear intent to allow hunting and fishing on public lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System (the System); (2) the intent of Congress has not changed in any way since the date of enactment of that Act, and any assumption to the contrary is misguided and misinterprets the clear intent of Congress; and (3) the general purpose of reserving certain land as public land, including the land within the System, is to make the land available to the public for reasonable uses, which include hunting, fishing, other wildlife-dependent sports, and other outdoor purposes.</summary>
