Commends the government of Canada for: (1) its renewed and long-term commitment to Afghanistan; (2) working to secure a democratic Afghanistan; (3) its commitment to reducing poverty, aiding the counternarcotics efforts through counterterrorism and counterinsurgency campaigns, and ensuring a peaceful and terror-free Afghanistan; and (4) its three-pronged commitment to Afghanistan: diplomacy, development, and defense.

Commends the leadership of former Canadian Prime Ministers Jean Jacques Chretien and Paul Martin and current Prime Minister Stephen Harper for their commitment to democracy, human rights, and freedom.
