Commends the government of Canada for: (1) its renewed and long-term commitment to the Global War on Terror; (2) working to secure a democratic and equal Afghanistan; (3) its commitment to reducing poverty, aiding counternarcotics efforts, and ensuring a peaceful and terror-free Afghanistan; and (4) its three-pronged commitment to Afghanistan of diplomacy, development, and defense.

Commends the leadership of former Canadian Prime Ministers Jean Jacques Chretien and Paul Martin and current Prime Minister Stephen Harper for their commitment to democracy, human rights, and freedom.

Expresses U.S. gratitude and appreciation for Canada's enduring friendship and leadership in the Global War on Terror in Afghanistan.</summary>
