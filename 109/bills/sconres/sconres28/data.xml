Calls for the Administration to: (1) address the lack of intellectual property protection in China and Russia; (2) ensure that any country receiving benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, such as Russia, provides such protection; (3) ensure that action is taken against any country with which the United States shares mutual commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO), such as China, when the country fails to live up to its WTO commitments; and (4) urge Russia to promote measures to enforce such protection to comply with commitments required by WTO.

Urges the President to take appropriate additional action to protect the intellectual property rights of U.S. businesses.</summary>
