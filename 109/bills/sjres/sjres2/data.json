Requires any deficit of receipts (including interest) relative to outlays of such trust funds to be counted and to be completely offset by a surplus of all other receipts over all other outlays.\n\nRequires a three-fifths roll call vote of each House to increase the public debt.\n\nDirects the President to submit a balanced budget to the Congress.\n\nProhibits any bill to increase revenue from becoming law unless approved by a majority of each House by a roll call vote.\n\nAuthorizes the Congress to waive these provisions when: (1) a declaration of war is in effect; or (2) the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by a joint resolution which becomes law.\n\nAllows any enforcement or implementation legislation of the Congress to rely on estimates of outlays and receipts."
