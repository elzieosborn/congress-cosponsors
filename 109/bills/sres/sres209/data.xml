  <summary date="2005-09-20T20:40:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Makes it out of order to consider a conference report: (1) if it is not filed and made available 48 hours before presentation; (2) unless the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate or table is available at the time of consideration; (3) if the preponderance of matter in the conference report is not in the jurisdiction of the committee (or Appropriations subcommittee for one of the regular appropriation bills) that had jurisdiction of the Senate passed bill submitted to conference; (4) if it contains extraneous material outside the scope of conference; or (5) if it contains extraneous material in the jurisdiction of a committee other than a committee from whom conferees were appointed.

Allows a Senator to raise a single point of order that several provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report violate this Act.

Sets forth procedures for consideration of certain points of order.

Requires: (1) this Act to be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Members, duly chosen and sworn; and (2) the same three-fifths affirmative vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this resolution.</summary>
