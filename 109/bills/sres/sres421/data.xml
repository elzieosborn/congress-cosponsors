  <summary date="2006-05-08T20:15:51Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

States that the Senate: (1) recognizes freedom of religion as a central tenet of democracy; (2) respects the right of the people of Afghanistan to self-government, while urging the government of Afghanistan to respect all universally recognized human rights; (3) condemns the arrest of Abdul Rahman and other instances of religious persecution in Afghanistan; (4) commends the dropping of charges against Abdul Rahman; and (5) urges the government of Afghanistan to consider the importance of religious freedom in the broader U.S.-Afghanistan relationship.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President and the President's representatives should: (1) raise concerns at the highest levels with the government of Afghanistan regarding the violations of internationally recognized human rights, including the right to freedom of religion or belief; and (2) ensure that the International Religious Freedom Report 2006 for Afghanistan fully addresses the issue of religious persecution in that country, including the arrest of Abdul Rahman.</summary>
