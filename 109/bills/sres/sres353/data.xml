  <summary date="2007-05-09T13:57:12Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Affirms U.S. support and respect for the welfare, human rights, and dignity of the people of Cambodia.

 Calls on the King of Cambodia to play a more active and constructive role in protecting the constitutional rights of all Cambodian citizens.

Calls on Prime Minister Hun Sen and the government of Cambodia to: (1) end its systematic campaign to undermine democracy, the rule of law, and human rights in Cambodia; and (2) release all political prisoners and drop all politically motivated charges against government opponents.

Urges international donors and multilateral organizations, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the United Nations, to hold Prime Minister Hun Sen and the government of Cambodia fully accountable for actions that undermine the investment of international donors in Cambodia's democratic and economic development.</summary>
