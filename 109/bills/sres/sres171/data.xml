  <summary date="2005-06-16T21:04:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Supports the men and women of the Armed Forces in Iraq and deeply appreciates their admirable service.

Recognizes that stability and democracy in Iraq are in the U.S. national interest.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States should remain committed to providing long-term diplomatic and political support to Iraq; (2) the United States should continue to pursue a robust and multi-faceted campaign against international terrorist networks in Iraq and around the world; and (3) not later than 30 days after the Senate agrees to this resolution, the President should report to Congress describing the Armed Forces' remaining mission in Iraq, and a time frame for the subsequent withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.</summary>
