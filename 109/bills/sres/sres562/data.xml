Recognizes the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha Sharp as genuine American heroes, and pays tribute to them as their names are added to the Wall of Rescuers in the permanent exhibition of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on September 14, 2006.

 Commends the organization founded to support the Sharps' work, the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, for its efforts to rescue Jews and opponents of the Nazi regime in Europe and for carrying on the Sharps' legacy by working to save the lives of the people of Darfur, Sudan and to protect human rights worldwide.

 Requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the Joukowsky family of Providence, Rhode Island, the direct descendants of the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha Sharp, and to the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee of Cambridge, Massachusetts.</summary>
