Recognizes the independence of the State of Israel as a significant event in providing refuge and a national homeland for the Jewish people, and congratulates the people of Israel as they celebrate the 57th anniversary of Israel's independence.

Supports Middle East peace efforts, including the disengagement plan of the Israeli government, the Roadmap, and the recent Quartet decision to appoint World Bank President James Wolfensohn as Coordinator for Gaza Disengagement.

Commends the bipartisan commitment of all administrations and Congresses since 1948 to stand by Israel and work for its security and well-being.</summary>
