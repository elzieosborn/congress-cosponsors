Expresses support for: (1) the people of Sri Lanka as they recover from the December 2004 tsunami, and the August 2005 assassination of the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakhsman Kadirgamar; and (2) the courageous decision by the government of Sri Lanka, following the assassination, to remain in discussions with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in an attempt to resolve peacefully the issues facing the people of Sri Lanka.

Urges all parties in Sri Lanka to remain committed to the negotiating process.</summary>
