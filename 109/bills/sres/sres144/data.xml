Expresses the sense of the Senate that Tim Nelson and Hugh Sims should be recognized for their bravery and their contributions in helping the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detain Zacarias Moussaoui (Nelson and Sims called the FBI's Minneapolis Office, setting into motion the only U.S. criminal prosecution stemming from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks).</summary>
