The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nExpresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the government of Germany's unfortunate early release of Mohammad Ali Hammadi has undermined joint U.S.-German efforts to combat international terrorism, and sends a signal of weakness to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and could increase the likelihood of further terrorist attacks against citizens worldwide; (2) the U.S. government should continue to call on the government of Lebanon to hand over Mr. Hammadi and other known terrorists so that they may face trial in the United States; (3) the U.S. government should take all appropriate steps to secure the arrest of Mr. Hammadi and his fellow hijackers and their transfer to the United States; and (4) the murderers of U.S. Navy Petty Officer Robert Dean Stethem must be brought to justice, and a clear message must be sent to the international community that the murder of U.S. service members or civilians will neither be tolerated nor forgotten."
