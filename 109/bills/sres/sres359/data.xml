  <summary date="2006-11-29T20:20:05Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Expresses support for the government of Romania's desire to improve the standard of care and well-being of children in Romania.

 Urges the government of Romania to: (1) complete the processing of certain intercountry adoption cases; and (2) amend its child welfare and adoption laws to decrease adoption barriers, including by allowing intercountry adoption by persons other than biological grandparents.

Urges the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to work with the government of Romania to achieve these ends.

 Requests that the European Union (EU) and its member states not impede the government of Romania's efforts to place orphaned or abandoned children in permanent homes in a manner that is consistent with Romania's obligations under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.</summary>
