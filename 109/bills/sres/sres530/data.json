The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nExpresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) in order to preserve the integrity of the G-8 as a forum of the leading industrialized democracies of the world, President George W. Bush and other heads of state attending the G-8 Summit should engage Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin in a dialogue about the anti-democratic behavior of the government of the Russian Federation; (2) the United States and other democratic countries should reaffirm their support for civic and non-governmental organizations working to promote democracy and the rule of law in Russia; (3) the government of the Russian Federation should take action to ensure that it guarantees the full range of civil and political rights to its citizens, as it is obligated to do under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (4) consistent with its obligations under the International Covenant, the government of the Russian Federation should take steps to cease its interference with foreign news organizations, including the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; (5) the government of the Russian Federation should take action to combat rising racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia in Russian society; and (6) the United States and countries of the G-8 should reaffirm their support for new democracies on the borders of Russia and, where applicable, expedite their integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions to provide a bulwark for democracy in eastern Europe and the Caucuses."
