Supports efforts by the United States and the European Union to fulfill commitments made in recent summits to implement all aspects of the United States-European Union Initiative to Enhance Transatlantic Economic Integration and Growth.

Calls upon the leadership of the United States and the European Union to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulatory compliance costs and non-tariff barriers to trade and investment at an accelerated pace. Urges such parties at the 2007 United States-European Union Summit to agree to a target date of 2015 for completing the transatlantic market and a study of existing obstacles to creating a transatlantic market that includes estimates of the costs of existing barriers to trade and investment and a timetable for removing those barriers.</summary>
