Designates November 2006 as National Lung Cancer Awareness Month.

Reaffirms the Senate's commitment to: (1) advancing lung cancer research and early detection, particularly the Lung Cancer Alliance of Georgia's goal of significantly increasing the 5-year survival rate of individuals diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States to 50% within 10 years; and (2) working with all federal agencies involved in cancer research to develop a coordinated road map for accomplishing that goal.</summary>
