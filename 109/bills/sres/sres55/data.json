The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nRecognizes that Zhao Ziyang: (1) made an important contribution to the people of China by providing assistance to the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989; and (2) remains a symbol of reform and human rights.\n\nExpresses sympathy for Zhao's family and to the people of China who were unable to appropriately mourn his death or to celebrate his life.\n\nCalls on the Government of China to: (1) release all prisoners of conscience, including those persons still imprisoned for their participation in the Tiananmen Square protests; and (2) allow those people exiled on account of their activities to return to China."
