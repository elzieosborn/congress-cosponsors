Expresses solidarity with the people of Spain as they commemorate the victims of the March 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, and condemns such attacks and all other terrorist acts against innocent civilians.

Welcomes: (1) the European Union (EU) decision to mark the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on European soil with a Day of Civic and Democratic Dialogue; and (2) the Club of Madrid initiative to bring together leaders and experts to develop an agenda for fighting terrorism and strengthening democracy.

Calls upon the United States and all nations to continue to work together to identify and prosecute the perpetrators of the Madrid attacks.

Looks forward to receiving the recommendations of the International Summit on Democracy, Terrorism, and Security for strengthening international cooperation against terrorism through democratic means.</summary>
