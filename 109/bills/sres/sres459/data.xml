  <summary date="2006-05-10T19:00:19Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should not be a signatory to any agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, unless: (1) a nonagricultural market access (NAMA) agreement would lead to a significant reduction or elimination of the substantial inequities in the average level of industrial tariff rates of all WTO members; (2) substantial increases in market access and U.S. exports are achieved through reductions in average tariff rates applied to manufactured goods; (3) sectoral tariff agreements are included that would result in a significant number of countries eliminating tariffs on products and in sectors that would increase U.S. exports; and (4) real new market access is achieved through the dismantling of nontariff barriers, particularly in sectors of primary importance to American manufacturers.</summary>
