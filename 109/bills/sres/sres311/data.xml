Urges: (1) all parties in Sri Lanka to remain committed to the negotiating process; and (2) all outside parties to support a free democratic process in the scheduled November 2005 Sri Lankan elections, and to work to prevent extremist groups in Sri Lanka from interfering with that process.</summary>
