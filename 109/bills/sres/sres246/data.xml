Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the U.S. Coast Guard should receive Congress's highest commendation for its response to the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina; (2) Congress should commit to providing the Coast Guard with resources it needs to modernize and maintain its fleet of vessels and aircraft; and (3) the Administration should ensure that the Coast Guard receives sufficient funding to cover its unexpected operational and capital costs associated with Hurricane Katrina.</summary>
