  <summary date="2006-05-12T19:52:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses disappointment at the failure of the Asia group members of the United Nations Disarmament Commission to stop Iran's election as vice chair of that body.

Asserts that the Commission has no credibility on disarmament issues due to Iran's participation, particularly in light of Iran's defiance in disregarding International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Security Council Presidential Statement resolutions relating to its nuclear program.

 Calls on the United States to reject all Commission resolutions.

Condemns Iran's continued intransigence with respect to its nuclear program, treatment of Israel, and sponsorship of terror.

States that the Senate shall work to ensure that U.S. funding is withheld from: (1) the regular budget of the United Nations in the amount directed towards the Commission; and (2) any U.N. commission in which the worst violators of the principles it claims to promote are included in its membership.

 Calls on the United Nations to deny Iranian participation in any U.N. commission until it: (1) complies with Non-Proliferation Treaty and IAEA resolutions; (2) halts all uranium enrichment activities and its calls for Israel's destruction; and (3) withdraws terrorist support.

Calls on the President to monitor U.N. reform and withhold funding unless credible reforms are made prior to biannual budget discussions.</summary>
