  <summary date="2006-08-23T20:44:11Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the members of the Armed Forces deserve the enormous respect and support of the Senate and the American people for their sacrifices on behalf of our country; and (2) the President's intention, as stated on March 21, 2006, that "future Presidents'' will determine whether to keep the Armed Forces in Iraq undermines U.S. military preparedness to respond to other crises and should not be supported.</summary>
