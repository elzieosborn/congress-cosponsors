Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Russian Federation should respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Georgia; (2) President Mikheil Saakashvili and the Government and people of Georgia deserve congratulations for the successful reforms carried out since President Saakashvili's inauguration; (3) the United States should support such reforms and assist Georgia in strengthening its democratic institutions and resolving its separatist conflicts peacefully; and (4) the United States should support Georgia in negotiating an agreement to end Russia's military presence in Georgia, in accordance with Russia's obligations under the ``Istanbul Commitments.''

Supports President Bush's efforts to encourage Russia and Georgia to reach agreement on the closure of Russian military bases in Georgia.

Commends President Bush for being the first U.S. President to visit Georgia since its recognition as an independent and sovereign country.</summary>
