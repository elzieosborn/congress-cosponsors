  <summary date="2005-10-19T20:47:09Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Welcomes recent attempts by the U.N. Secretary General to address the issue of anti-Semitism, and calls on U.N. leadership to condemn anti-Semitic statements made at U.N. meetings and hold member states accountable for such statements.

Urges the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to develop and implement Holocaust education programs as part of an effort against anti-Semitism and racial, religious, and ethnic intolerance.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the President should direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to continue working toward further reduction of anti-Semitic language and anti-Israel resolutions; (2) the President should direct the Secretary of State to report on acts of anti-Semitism at the United Nations and its agencies by member states; and (3) projects funded through the Middle East Partnership Initiative and U.S. overseas broadcasts should include efforts to educate Arab and Muslim countries about anti-Semitism, religious intolerance, and incitement to violence.</summary>
