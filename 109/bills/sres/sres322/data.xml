  <summary date="2005-12-01T18:14:12Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the criminal justice system in Russia has not accorded Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev fair treatment under the laws of the Russian Federation; (2) the Russian Federation's status among the democratic nations of the world would be greatly enhanced if Russian authorities were to take the necessary actions to dispel concerns that the criminal cases against Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Lebedev, and their associates are politically motivated, the transfer of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev to prison camps thousands of kilometers from their homes represents a violation of the norms and practices of Russia law, and in cases dealing with perceived political threats to the authorities the judiciary of Russia is a dependent instrument of the Kremlin; and (3) Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev should be transferred to penal facilities with locations that are consonant with the norms and general practices of Russia law.</summary>
