        <text>The rule provides for separate consideration in the House of H.R. 739, H.R. 740, H.R. 741 and H.R. 742. The rule provides one hour of general debate for each bill, equally divided and controlled. The amendments in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Education and the Workforce now printed in H.R. 740 and H.R. 741, shall be considered as adopted. In the engrossment of H.R. 739, the Clerk shall add the texts of H.R. 740, H.R. 741, and H.R. 742, as passed by the House, as new matter at the end of H.R. 739, and then lay on the table H.R. 740, H.R. 741, and H.R. 742. If H.R. 739 is disposed of without reaching the stage of engrossment, then whichever of the 3 remaining bills first passes the House shall be treated in the manner specified for H.R. 739 and all other bills which have passed the House shall be laid on the table.</text>
