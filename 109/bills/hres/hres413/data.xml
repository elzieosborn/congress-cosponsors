  <summary date="2005-09-08T19:28:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Calls on the government of Egypt to: (1) meet its obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (2) repeal the state of emergency and allow full access to the constitutional and international guarantees of the rule of law and due process; (3) repeal a presidential decree banning members of the Baha'i community from practicing their faith; (4) take appropriate steps to prevent and punish acts of anti-Semitism, including anti-Semitic rhetoric in the government-controlled media; (5) investigate and prosecute acts of religious violence, and provide all places of worship with equal treatment and protection; and (6) reform the national educational curriculum to exclude promotion of religious, ethnic, or gender intolerance or violence.

 Calls on the government of the United States to: (1) negotiate an agreement with the government of Egypt to establish a timetable for political and human rights reforms, such that the dimensions and direction of economic assistance to Egypt will depend upon meeting certain agreed upon benchmarks; and (2) offer direct assistance without prior government approval to Egyptian human rights and other civil society groups which seek to strengthen democratic principles and promote the rule of law.</summary>
