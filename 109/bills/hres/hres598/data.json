Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1595, and 1636.\n\nEncourages the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use U.S. influence in the U.N. Security Council to advocate for the application of punitive measures and sanctions against Syria that target its leadership if Syria fails to cooperate fully with the UNIIIC investigation and continues to violate Resolutions 1559, 1595, and 1636.\n\nUrges the U.S. government to support UNIIIC's extension of jurisdiction to include assassinations and assassination attempts in Lebanon since October 1, 2004.\n\n Urges the President to implement further measures against the Syrian leadership in accordance with the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-175), particularly if Syria fails to cooperate fully with the ongoing UNIIIC investigation and continues to violate Resolutions 1559, 1595, and 1636."
