  <summary date="2005-09-07T18:43:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC): (1) has endangered the lives of people in every region of the world, and should adhere to internationally recognized health standards by prohibiting the use of antiviral medication to protect their livestock; and (2) should no longer purposefully hide any pathogenic outbreaks or mutations that could be harmful to the global community, but should instead consult with experts from both within their government and outside their country to handle situations that could endanger millions of lives.</summary>
