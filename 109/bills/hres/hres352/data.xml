  <summary date="2005-07-27T19:09:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes that improving the competitiveness of the U.S. economy depends on congressional action to remove barriers to keeping and creating jobs in the United States, particularly barriers in the areas of: (1) trade restrictions and inequality; (2) bureaucratic red tape; (3) innovation and investment; (4) health care security; (5) lifelong learning; (6) tax burden and complexity; (7) lawsuit abuse and litigation management; and (8) energy self-sufficiency and security.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that every federal agency should review its rules and policies regarding the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.</summary>
