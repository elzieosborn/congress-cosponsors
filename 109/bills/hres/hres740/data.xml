  <summary date="2006-07-10T20:29:51Z" status="Passed House amended">Expresses deepest condolences to the family of Patrick Finucane on his death, commends their steadfast pursuit of justice in his brutal murder, and thanks his wife Geraldine and son Michael for their willingness to testify on this matter before committees of the House of Representatives.

Supports Administration efforts in seeking full implementation of the Weston Park Agreement and establishment of an independent judicial inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder.

 Calls on the government of the United Kingdom to: (1) reconsider its position on the matter of an inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder; (2) amend the Inquiries Act of 2005; and (3) take fully into account objections raised by Judge Cory, U.S. government officials, other governments and international bodies, and Mr. Finucane's family.

Urges the government of the United Kingdom to establish a full, independent, and public judicial inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder which would enjoy the support of his family, the people of Northern Ireland, and the international community as recommended by Judge Cory.</summary>
