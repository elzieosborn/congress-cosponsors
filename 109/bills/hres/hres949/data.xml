  <summary date="2006-09-22T17:31:06Z" status="Introduced in House">Commends the strong U.S.-Romania relationship.

 Recognizes the government of Romania's economic, political, and social reforms, and urges the government to take additional steps to establish an independent, professional, and non-political justice system, in part by taking action to end all politically inspired legal cases.

 Values the participation of Romanian troops and civilian experts in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

 Urges the government of Romania to complete the processing of intercountry adoption cases which were pending when Law 273/2004 was enacted and to amend its child welfare and adoption laws to decrease adoption barriers, including by allowing intercountry adoption by persons other than biological grandparents.

 Welcomes Romanian President Traian Basescu to the United States and looks forward to expanded U.S.-Romania political, diplomatic, economic, and military cooperation.</summary>
