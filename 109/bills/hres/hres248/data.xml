  <summary date="2005-05-16T15:21:12Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Waives points of order against the consideration of the conference report on H.Con.Res. 95 (establishing the congressional budget for FY 2006).

Makes it out of order for a motion that the Committee of the Whole rise and report a bill to the House of Representatives if the bill, as amended, exceeds an applicable allocation of new budget authority under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as estimated by the Committee on the Budget.

Requires the Chair of the Committee to put the question regarding the motion if a point of order is sustained.

Excludes from such prohibition a motion offered under rule XXI (Restrictions on Certain Bills) or after disposition of the question on a given bill.

Makes it out or order, if a question is decided in the negative, for a further amendment except: (1) one proper amendment, under specified conditions; and (2) pro forma amendments, if offered by the chairman or ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their designees, for debate purposes.</summary>
