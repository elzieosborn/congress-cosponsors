  <summary date="2006-08-10T18:41:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Commends: (1) the counterterrorism cooperation of Italy, Sweden, and Bosnia-Herzegovina; and (2) the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for increasing U.S. and European security through counterterrorism operations and for decreasing the likelihood of terrorist attacks.

 Condemns the European Parliament for criticizing CIA and allied counterterrorism efforts.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Temporary Committee of the European Parliament's declarations on the alleged CIA use of European countries for transport and illegal detention of prisoners decrease the security of European and American citizens and increase the likelihood of terrorist acts.</summary>
