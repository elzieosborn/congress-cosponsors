Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (or, in the case of a mailing sent electronically, includes a link to such a solicitation on an Internet site), if the entity is included in the list of relief organizations responding to the disaster which is maintained or referred to in official notices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</summary>
