  <summary date="2006-10-30T16:02:59Z" status="Introduced in House">Condemns the use of innocent civilians as human shields, including Hezbollah's recent use of this brutal and illegal tactic.

 Calls on: (1) the international community to recognize the breaches of international law through the use of human shields; and (2) the community of U.S. and international jurisprudential scholars and practitioners and the leadership of the Armed Forces to review the current international legal regime and to make recommendations to prevent the future use of human shields during armed conflicts.</summary>
