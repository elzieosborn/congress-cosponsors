Requires the committee in the latter case to establish an adjudicatory subcommittee, but not issue the letter.</p> <p>Requires an investigative subcommittee, whenever it does not adopt a statement of alleged violation, to transmit a report to that effect to the respondent, who shall have seven calendar days after its receipt to submit views in writing, which shall be appended to the report and made part of the record.</p> <p>Grants the same due process rights to a Member other than one whom the complaint is made if the letter references the official conduct of such Member.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Repeals the mandate that the chairman and ranking minority member establish jointly an investigative subcommittee for consideration of a complaint if it is not disposed of within the applicable period set forth in the SOC Committee's rules.

Requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the SOC Committee to establish such a subcommittee. Requires dismissal of any complaint at the end of the applicable period if no investigative subcommittee has been established.</p> <p>Requires a respondent to be informed of the right to be represented by counsel of his or her choice (even if such counsel represents another respondent or a witness), provided at his or her own expense. Requires that a witness be afforded a reasonable period of time, as determined by the SOC Committee or subcommittee, to prepare for an appearance before an investigative subcommittee or for an adjudicatory hearing, and to obtain counsel of his or her choice (even if such counsel represents a respondent or another witness). </p> <p>Amends Rule X to provide that the House may (currently, must) approve other exceptions (not specified in the House Rules) to the limitation on the number of committees or subcommittees that a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may serve simultaneously.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>(Sec. 3) Continues specified budget enforcement mechanisms from the 108th Congress.
