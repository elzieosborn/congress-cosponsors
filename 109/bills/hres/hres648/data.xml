  <summary date="2006-03-13T15:51:40Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends rule IV (The Hall of the House) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to deny entitlement to the privilege of admission to the Hall of the House and adjacent rooms to any former Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, a former Parliamentarian of the House, or a former elected officer of the House or former minority employee nominated as an elected officer of the House, if he or she is a registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal. (Continues the current prohibition regarding direct personal or pecuniary interest in any pending or reported legislative measure, or employment by or representation of any party or organization for the purpose of influencing, directly or indirectly, the passage, defeat, or amendment of any legislative proposal.)

Authorizes the Speaker of the House to promulgate regulations exempting ceremonial or educational functions from these prohibitions.

Prohibits the House from providing access to any exercise facility (available exclusively to Members and former Members, officers and former officers of the House, and their spouses) to any former Member, former officer, or spouse who is a registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal.</summary>
