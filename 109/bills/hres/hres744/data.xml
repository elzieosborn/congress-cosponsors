  <summary date="2006-05-03T21:21:32Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Reiterates the House of Representatives' support for the Good Friday Agreement as the blueprint for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.

Commends: (1) the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair and the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern for their leadership in seeing to a peaceful resolution in Northern Ireland; (2) the Sinn Fein leadership in successfully urging the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to end its armed struggle and put its weapons beyond use; (3) the leadership of Sir Hugh S. Orde, Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and the Police Service for institution of the Historical Equities Team; (4) Nuala O'Loan and the Police Ombudsman's Office for promoting human rights in law enforcement; and (5) the Northern Irish Policing Board and its District Partnerships for promoting genuine community policing in Northern Ireland.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) all groups and organizations should end their involvement in paramilitary activity; (2) all Northern Ireland political parties should agree to share power according to the democratic mandate of the Good Friday Agreement, commit to work in good faith with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, and work toward participating with the Police Service of Northern Ireland; and (3) the government of the United Kingdom and the government of Ireland should work to fully implement the Good Friday Agreement.</summary>
