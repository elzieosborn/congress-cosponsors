      <text>POINT OF ORDER - Ms. Baldwin raised a point of order against consideration of H.

The Chair stated that the threshold required under the rule for identifying the unfunded mandate had been met and the House proceeded with 20 minutes of debate which will be followed by putting the question on consideration of H. Res. 850.</text>
