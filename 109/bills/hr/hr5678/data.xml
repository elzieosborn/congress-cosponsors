  <summary date="2006-09-20T19:33:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Pipeline Safety and Reliability Improvement Act of 2006 - Amends federal transportation law to revise certain one-call notification system minimum requirements to subject to certain civil and criminal penalties any person who: (1) excavates without first using the one-call notification system to establish the location of underground pipelines; (2) disregards pipeline location information or markings; or (3) fails to take reasonable steps to prevent pipeline damage during excavation. Requires state damage prevention programs to subject persons who violate program requirements to certain civil penalties and other enforcement actions.

Requires a state that has an annual pipeline safety program certification, or a pipeline safety agreement, to have a qualified damage prevention program in order to qualify for a grant to improve its damage prevention program. Authorizes such grants to states that take action to remedy a pipeline safety-related condition that has been ordered to be corrected. Makes technology development grants to eligible organizations to prevent pipeline damage caused by excavation activities.

Urges the streamlining of state and local government permitting procedures for pipeline repair projects (current law) and hazardous liquid pipeline construction projects.

Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) participate in international forums that establish or recommend mandatory standards for transporting gas and hazardous liquids by pipeline in international commerce; and (2) provide assistance to domestic and international organizations to reduce or eliminate inconsistent requirements that inhibit the safety of pipeline transportation in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.

Authorizes the Secretary to conduct analyses of the domestic transport capacity of petroleum products by pipeline.</summary>
