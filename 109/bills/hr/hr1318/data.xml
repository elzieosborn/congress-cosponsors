Declares that any political subdivision of the State of Montana which holds a Federal Power Act license in Granite and Deer Lodge Counties, Montana, shall be required to pay the lesser of $25,000 or such annual charge for the use of its lands as any Federal department or agency may assess, as long as such political subdivision continues to hold the project license.</summary>
