  <summary date="2005-12-12T20:23:45Z" status="Reported to House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends specified federal law with respect to the negotiated settlement of tribal claims.

Extends from December 31, 1999, to December 31, 2005, the earliest date on which an Indian tribe shall be deemed to have received a certain reconciliation report for purposes of calculating the statute of limitations on claims against the United States for the mismanagement of tribal trust assets.

(The reconciliation report, required by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (AITFMRA), is a report by the Secretary of the Interior to specified congressional committees identifying for each tribal trust fund account for which the Secretary is responsible a balance reconciled as of September 30, 1995. The stated intent of AITFMRA is to provide recipients of reconciliation reports with the opportunity to postpone the filing of claims, or to facilitate the voluntary dismissal of claims, to encourage settlement negotiations with the United States.)</summary>
