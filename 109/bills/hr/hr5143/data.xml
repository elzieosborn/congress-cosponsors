Instructs the Secretary to widely advertise prize competitions to encourage broad participation, including by individuals, universities (including historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions), and large and small businesses (including businesses owned or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons).

Directs the Secretary enter into an agreement with a private, nonprofit entity to administer the prize competitions.

Terminates the authority to announce the prize competitions on September 30, 2017.

 (Sec. 4) Designates prize-eligible categories, including: (1) advancements in certain hydrogen components or systems; (2) prototypes of hydrogen-powered vehicles or other hydrogen-based products that meet or exceed certain performance criteria; and (3) transformational changes in technologies for hydrogen distribution or production that meet or exceed far-reaching criteria, including minimal carbon emissions, and which may include cost criteria designed to facilitate the eventual market success of a winning technology.

Prescribes guidelines for implementation and eligibility.

(Sec. 6) Declares that the federal government shall not, by virtue of offering or awarding a prize under this Act, be entitled to any intellectual property rights derived as a consequence of, or direct relation to, the participation by a registered participant in a competition authorized by this Act.

(Sec. 7) Prescribes guidelines for waiver of liability by registered participants.

(Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2016. Prescribes award allocation guidelines.
