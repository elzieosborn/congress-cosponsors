    "text": "Nuclear Waste Terrorist Threat Assessment and Protection Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate the development and implementation of an interagency plan to prepare for and defend against terrorist crimes targeting the Yucca Mountain Project (high-level nuclear waste repository being studied at Yucca Mountain, Nevada). Requires that the plan: (1) include a comprehensive analysis of the safety and vulnerability of the Project to Federal crimes of terrorism; (2) address specified types of attacks; (3) give special emphasis to addressing the use of nuclear waste as a radiological weapon, the use of specified technologies, and sabotage or theft of high-level nuclear waste; (4) include a comprehensive strategy for defending against terrorism; and (5) include an analysis of the economic, public health, and environmental costs and impacts of implementing the interagency plan. Directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate the development and implementation of a comprehensive interagency plan to ensure that Federal, State, and local government response plans and programs can respond adequately to the consequences of terrorism against the Project. Requires the Secretary and FEMA to enter into appropriate arrangements with the National Research Council for technical review of the plans. Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from submitting a license application regarding, and prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a license for, a Yucca Mountain repository unless: (1) such plans are completed and included in the final environmental impact statement for Yucca Mountain; (2) public hearings have been held for affected populations; (3) the Secretary has certified that the Project is not vulnerable to terrorism; and (4) the Secretary has prepared and transmitted to Congress a report on the potential liability costs and damages resulting from a wide range of Federal terrorism crimes against the Project."
