Authorizes FY2006-FY2010 appropriations.\n\nDefines \"brownfield site\" for purposes of this section.\n\nMakes brownfields-related environmental cleanup and economic development activities eligible for community development block grant (CDBG) assistance. Authorizes CDBG use to administer renewal communities."
