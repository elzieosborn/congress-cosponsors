(Sec. 2) Requires the study to analyze: (1) the changing nature of hedge funds and what characteristics define a hedge fund; (2) the growth of hedge funds within financial markets; (3) the growth of pension funds investing in hedge funds; (4) whether hedge fund investors are able to protect themselves adequately from the risk associated with their investments; (5) whether hedge fund leverage is effectively constrained; (6) the potential risks hedge funds pose to financial markets or to investors; (7) various international approaches to hedge fund regulation; and (8) benefits of the hedge fund industry to the economy and the markets.

Requires the recommendations to include: (1) any proposed legislation relating to appropriate disclosure requirements for hedge funds; (2) the type of information hedge funds should disclose to regulators and to the public; (3) any efforts the hedge fund industry or regulators of financial institutions should undertake to improve practices or provide examples of successful industry initiatives; and (4) any oversight responsibilities that members of the President's Working Group should have over the hedge fund industry, and the degree and scope of such oversight.</summary>
