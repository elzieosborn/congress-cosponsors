Authorizes assistance under this Act for activities identified by a community, the economy of which is injured by one or more brownfield sites.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for brownfield site redevelopment grants for FY 2006 through 2010.\n\nLimits the Federal share of costs for activities funded by such grants to 75 percent of the total.\n\nDefines \"brownfield site\" by reference to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) as real property the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant (subject to certain exclusions), and with respect to which an entity has received or is eligible to receive CERCLA funding for site characterization, assessment, or remediation."
