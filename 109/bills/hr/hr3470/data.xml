  <summary date="2005-08-29T22:28:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Accountability in Foster Care Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Advisory Panel on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) to revise and monitor the data collection, analysis, and reporting system designed to be used to assess and improve state performance in operating child protection and child welfare programs (pursuant to parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act).

Directs the Secretary to publish notice of proposed regulations, based on Advisory Panel recommendations, and final regulations to revise AFCARS. Requires such regulations to: (1) permit longitudinal analysis of child-specific outcomes, including analysis of entry and exit cohort data for children in and emancipated from foster care; (2) permit AFCARS to be integrated with the planned National Youth in Transition Database; and (3) contain any other rules necessary to ensure that the revised AFCARS can perform specified functions.</summary>
