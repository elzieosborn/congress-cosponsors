    "text": "Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2005 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to distribute to states at least 80 percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to pay the reasonable costs incurred under cooperative agreements of: (1) certain corrective actions; (2) directly related administrative expenses; or (3) enforcement of state or local requirements regulating underground storage tanks (USTs). Allows undistributed funds to be used for enforcing UST regulations. Requires the Administrator or a state with an approved program to require compliance inspections of USTs at least once every three years. Requires the study of compliance assurance programs that could serve as an alternative to the inspection programs. Directs the Administrator to publish operator training guidelines and states to develop and implement a training strategy consistent with stated requirements. Authorizes the use of funds made available for the petroleum response program to carry out corrective actions with respect to releases of fuel containing an oxygenated fuel additive that presents a threat to human health or welfare or the environment. Permits the use of trust funds for release prevention and compliance (as well as corrective actions). Requires compliance reports by any federal or state agency responsible for USTs. Authorizes a state or the Administrator to prohibit the delivery of regulated substances (motor fuels) to non-compliant tanks. Provides temporary relief for certain tanks in remote locations. Includes underground storage tank systems and release response activity (as well as underground storage tanks) that are under federal jurisdiction under the UST control and abatement requirements. Requires compliance strategy reports by any federal agency responsible for USTs which list the USTs and describe compliance actions. Requires the Administrator and Indian Tribes to correct UST releases on Indian lands."
