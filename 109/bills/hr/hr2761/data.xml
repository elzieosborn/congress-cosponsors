  <summary date="2005-09-16T15:32:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Screening Mammography Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group coverage, that provides coverage for diagnostic mammography for any class of participants or beneficiaries to also provide coverage for annual screening mammography for that class under terms that are not less favorable. Prohibits: (1) denying screening coverage on the basis that the screening is not medically necessary or is not pursuant to a referral or recommendation; (2) denying eligibility, enrollment, or renewal solely to avoid this requirement; (3) providing monetary incentives to participants or beneficiaries to encourage them to accept less than such minimum protections; (4) penalizing providers because they provide such care; or (5) providing incentives to induce providers to provide such care. Declares that this Act does not preempt any state laws providing at least these protections.

Applies such requirements and prohibitions to health coverage offered in the individual market. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to mandate coverage of annual screening mammographies.</summary>
