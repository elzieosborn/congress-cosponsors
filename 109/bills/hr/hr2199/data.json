Sets forth documentation, petition, determination, and payment procedures. States that such payments do not create or admit any claim, but do constitute full satisfaction of all claims by or on behalf of such an individual. Provides that such payments do not constitute income for tax, benefits, or other purposes. Prohibits the assignment or transfer of rights under this Act. Limits petitions to one per victim. Terminates the program after five years. Excludes payments from consideration as: (1) compensation or reimbursement in determining repayment for insurance or worker's compensation benefits; or (2) income or resources in determining eligibility for social security income benefits."
