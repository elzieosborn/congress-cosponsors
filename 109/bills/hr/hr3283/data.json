    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nUnited States Trade Rights Enforcement Act - (Sec. 2) Expresses the sense of Congress about making the countervailing duty law under the Tariff Act of 1930 applicable to actions by nonmarket economy countries, and the impact on the U.S. economy of the huge growth in trade with the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\n(Sec. 3) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to impose countervailing duties on certain merchandise from nonmarket economy countries.\n\nRevises the definition of countervailable subsidy regarding countervailing duty investigations to provide that with respect to the PRC, if the Secretary of Commerce encounters special difficulties in calculating the amount of subsidy benefits to be conferred, the Secretary may use methodologies for identifying and measuring such subsidy benefits which take into account the possibility that prevailing terms and conditions in China may not always be available as appropriate benchmarks. Requires the administering authority, when applying such methodologies, where practicable, to adjust such prevailing terms and conditions before considering the use of those prevailing outside China.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Commerce, in imposing countervailable duties and subsidies on a class or kind of merchandise of a nonmarket economy country, to ensure that: (1) no countervailable subsidy is double counted in an antidumping order on the same class or kind of merchandise of the country;
