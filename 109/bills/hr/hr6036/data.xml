  <summary date="2006-11-17T21:31:43Z" status="Introduced in House">Help Establish Access to Local Timely Healthcare for Your Vets (HEALTHY Vets) Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in the case of a veteran for whom Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities are geographically inaccessible, to use current authority for contracting out veterans' medical care to non-Department facilities in order to provide the following care to such veterans: (1) primary care; (2) acute or chronic symptom management; (3) nontherapeutic medical services; and (4) other medical services determined appropriate by the director of that geographic service region, after consultation with the Department physician responsible for the veteran's primary care.

Outlines conditions under which Department facilities shall be deemed geographically inaccessible.

Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirement of geographic inaccessibility, on a case-by-case basis, if the costs to the Department of providing such care significantly outweigh the benefits of localized health care for the veteran.</summary>
