Amends the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to direct the FCC to modify its rules for multiple ownership of TV broadcast stations to increase to 45 (currently 39) percent the national audience reach limitations for TV stations owned by the same entity or person. Directs the FCC to revise its rules for local television multiple ownership to allow a person to own, operate, or control two TV stations in the same market area if the grade B contours of such station: (1) do not overlap; or (2) do overlap and at least six independent broadcast or cable television voices would remain in the area after transfer of the license of the stations in question."
