    "text": "Prevention of Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2006 - Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to revise certain aquatic invasive species prevention requirements to, among other things: (1) apply them to certain U.S. vessels and to certain foreign vessels (or a structure being towed by a vessel) that are en route to, or have departed from, a U.S. port; and (2) establish ballast water exchange and treatment and sediment management standards for vessels of the armed forces.\n\nProhibits an operator of a vessel from uptaking or discharging ballast water or sediment, except in specified circumstances, from a U.S. vessel operating in U.S. or non-U.S. waters. Requires a vessel to conduct all its ballast water management operations in accordance with an aquatic invasive species plan designed to minimize the discharge of aquatic invasive species.\n\n Requires a vessel, before discharging ballast water into U.S. waters, to conduct ballast water treatment so that the discharged ballast water will contain no more than a specified level of living organisms or microbes. Prohibits an operator of a vessel, until the vessel conducts such treatment, from discharging ballast water except after certain ballast water exchange and ballast water treatment requirements are met.\n\n Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act.\n\nUrges the Secretary to negotiate with foreign countries to develop and implement an international program for preventing the unintentional introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species.\n\nEstablishes a priority pathway management program that, among other things: (1) identifies pathways that pose the highest risk for the introduction of aquatic invasive species unless further managed; and (2) develops recommendations for management strategies for those high-risk pathways.\n\nImplements a national system of ecological surveys for rapid early detection and monitoring of aquatic invasive species."
