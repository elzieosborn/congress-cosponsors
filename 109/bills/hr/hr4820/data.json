    "text": "Port Operations Require Tough Scrutiny (PORTS) Act of 2006 - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 relating to investigations of proposed corporate mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers (transactions) in the United States by a foreign interest which could affect U.S. national security to: (1) extend from 30 to 60 days after notification of the proposed transaction the period in which such investigation must be commenced by the President, if it is determined that there should be an investigation; and (2) allow an extension of such deadline by up to ten additional days if determined appropriate.\n\nRequires the investigation of a transaction which could result in foreign control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect U.S. critical infrastructure.\n\nStates with respect to certain mandatory investigations that if the President determines that the transaction should be approved or does not otherwise object to the transaction and the President does not suspend or prohibit such transaction, then the President, within 30 days after such decision, shall notify Congress of the decision. Allows Congress 45 days after such notification to enact into law a joint resolution disapproving the decision of the President and requiring the President to prohibit the proposed transaction, or, if the transaction has been completed, directing the Attorney General to seek divestment.\n\nRequires annual reports from the President to the congressional homeland security and intelligence committees on actions taken with regard to such investigations.\n\nDirects the Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) verify on-site the security measures of each individual and entity participating in the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program and the Free And Secure Trade (FAST) program; and (2) establish policies for non-compliance with requirements of the C-TPAT program, including probation and expulsion."
