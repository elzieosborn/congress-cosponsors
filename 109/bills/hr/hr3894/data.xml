  <summary date="2005-11-21T14:59:51Z" status="Passed House amended">Hurricane Katrina Emergency Housing Act of 2005 - (Sec. 2) Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to waive specified requirements under the section 8 (United States Housing Act of 1937) housing voucher and project-based assistance programs for an individual or family: (1) who resides or resided on August 25, 2005, in any area subject to a presidential disaster or emergency declaration in connection with Hurricane Katrina, or who resides or resided on September 24, 2005, in any area subject to a presidential disaster or emergency declaration in connection with Hurricane Rita; (2) whose residence became uninhabitable or inaccessible as a result of such disasters or emergencies; and (3) who was receiving such rental benefits as of such applicable date.

Specifies voucher requirements that may be waived as: (1) tenant rent contributions; (2) assistance eligibility; (3) income verification; (4) one-year lease requirement; (5) public housing agency (PHA) initial housing inspection; (6) portability restrictions; (7) certain lease addenda permitting termination of tenancy; and (8) access to federally funded programs by persons having limited English proficiency.

Terminates waiver authority 12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, unless the Secretary determines that such waivers are no longer needed, in which case the period specified is the six-month period beginning on such date of enactment.

(Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary to directly administer section 8 vouchers if the appropriate PHA is unable to do so because of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita.

(Sec. 4) Specifies project-based requirements that may be waived as: (1) tenant rent contributions; (2) income verification; (3) one-year lease requirement; (4) public housing agency (PHA) initial housing inspection; (5) certain lease addenda permitting termination of tenancy; and (6) access to federally funded programs by persons having limited English proficiency.

Terminates waiver authority 12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, unless the Secretary determines that such waivers are no longer needed, in which case the period specified is the six-month period beginning on such date of enactment.

(Sec. 5) States that: (1) a project-based housing assistance contract covering a project damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita shall not expire because of the damage or destruction of dwelling units in the project; and (2) the contract's expiration date shall be the later of the contract date or three months after the units are first made habitable.

(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, other appropriate agency heads, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) to compile an inventory of federal civilian and defense facilities and other properties that can be used: (1) for emergency housing; (2) as construction sites for temporary housing; or (3) to provide permanent housing.

Directs the Secretary to provide Congress with an aggregate inventory report.
