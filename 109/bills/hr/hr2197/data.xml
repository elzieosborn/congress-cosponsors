  <summary date="2005-06-16T19:07:58Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Care for Working Families Act of 2005 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to require each large employer to: (1) offer to each of its employees the opportunity to enroll in a qualifying health benefit plan that provides coverage for the employee and the employee's family; (2) contribute to the cost of such a plan; and (3) withhold the employee's share of the plan premium from the employee's wages.

 Defines a qualifying health benefit plan as one that: (1) provides benefits for health care items and services actuarially equivalent to or greater in value than those offered as of January 1, 2006, under the Blue Cross/Blue Shield (BCBS) Standard Plan provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP); and (2) meets health insurance coverage requirements under the Public Health Service Act. Sets the minimum required contribution by an employer at the same portion of the total premium as the federal government pays for the BCBS Standard Plan under FEHBP. Requires any employee covered under a federal health insurance program to accept an employer's offer of health insurance coverage and agree to payroll withholdings. Requires the relevant federal administrator of such a program to provide for the payment of the employee's share of the premium upon the employee's request. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require a health insurance issuer that offers employee health insurance coverage to an employer to ensure that it complies with requirements of this Act.</summary>
