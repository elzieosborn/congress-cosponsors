Sets forth civil penalties for U.S. citizens or such private entities who violate such rules.\n\nAmends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require country reports on human rights practices to include descriptions of child abuse or human rights violations against any children at foreign-based institutions.\n\nAmends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to support inspections of child residential treatment facilities. Conditions such grants on State adoption and enforcement of laws with licensing requirements for such institutions, including certain criminal and civil penalties, set forth in this Act."
