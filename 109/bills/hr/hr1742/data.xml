Includes within the definition of "qualified public school modernization bonds" bonds for the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land for such facility (qualified school construction bonds) and bonds to finance certain academic programs below the postsecondary level in empowerment zones or enterprise communities (qualified zone academy bonds). Establishes a national limitation on the amount of bonds designated as public school construction bonds and zone academy bonds and provides for the allocation of bond amounts among the States according to a specified formula. Limits the term of such bonds to 15 years and terminates the authority for issuance of such bonds after September 30, 2010.
