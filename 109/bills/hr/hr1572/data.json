Declares further that a PDP sponsor or MA organization may not require a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program or an RX plan to apply such cost management tools when coordinating benefits.\n\nAmends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to repeal current requirements governing the coordination of prescription drug benefits."
