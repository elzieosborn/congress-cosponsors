  <summary date="2005-08-18T19:58:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the federal judicial code to require the public or private employer of a federal grand or petit juror to pay to that juror his or her regular pay (or average daily wage) for each day such individual performs jury duty, less the aggregate amount of any fees and allowances paid.

Allows a person summoned for jury service to be excused upon a showing by his or her employer that payment during such service would result in significant hardship to the employer.</summary>
