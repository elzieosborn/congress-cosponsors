Provides for judicial action for any employee so aggrieved.\n\nRequires the investigative organization, upon receipt of a report of an instance of noncompliance, to: (1) provide notice to the Secretary and other investigative organizations involved of receipt of the report within three business days, using a standard format and manner of transmission developed by the Secretary for such purpose; (2) promptly determine whether to investigate the report; and (3) if appropriate, promptly investigate it.\n\nRequires that the Secretary, in measuring the performance of an investigative organization under contract, to provide for appropriate adjustments to payments for failure to carry out the responsibilities of this Act.
