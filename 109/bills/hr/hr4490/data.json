Provides for: (1) temporary deferment of student loan repayment by affected individuals; and (2) waiver of consecutive service requirements for affected individuals under a program of student loan forgiveness for school teachers.\n\nDirects the Secretary to make special efforts to notify affected students who qualify for a means-tested federal benefit program of their potential eligibility for a maximum Pell Grant and to disseminate informational materials regarding such eligibility."
