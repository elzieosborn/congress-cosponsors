    "text": "Food Freshness Disclosure Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide that a food shall be deemed to be misbranded unless its label bears information on freshness. Requires the label to state a date upon which the food will no longer be fresh (i.e., contain the quantity of nutrients specified on the label and otherwise be not adulterated and of acceptable quality). Requires such date to be preceded by \"best if used by,\" and requires such label to be conspicuously located, easy to read, and in a type size no smaller than eight point. Directs that the freshness date be on the containers of any food sent to the seller of such food to consumers. Makes this Act inapplicable to any food that is exempt from nutrition labeling requirements."
