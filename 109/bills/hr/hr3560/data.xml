  <summary date="2005-10-20T20:13:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Food Choking Prevention Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to carry out a program to provide education to the public on food choking hazards to children, including education on prevention and lifesaving procedures.

Requires the Commissioner to: (1) give priority to providing education to parents of children 14 years of age or younger and to such children directly; and (2) designate a particular week for intensification of the dissemination to the public of information. Authorizes the Commissioner to make awards of grants or contracts for the purpose of holding classes for the public during such week on preventing food choking hazards and performing lifesaving procedures.

Requires the Commissioner to request the National Academy of Sciences to enter into an agreement to conduct a comprehensive study to: (1) assess current data and data collection efforts; (2) document food choking-related deaths and injuries; (3) consider the nature and causes of childhood food choking incidents; (4) establish criteria for determining whether a food poses a significant choking hazard to children; and (5) assess the opportunities and key impediments to initiatives to reduce the number of child deaths and injuries due to food choking.

Directs the Commissioner to report to Congress on the reliability and utility of current systems for the collection of data on food choking-related deaths.</summary>
