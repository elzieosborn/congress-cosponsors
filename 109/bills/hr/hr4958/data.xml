Directs the Secretary to: (1) make it a priority to increase the number of domestically bred canines used by the Department to assist its counter-terrorism mission; (2) increase the utilization of domestically bred canines from universities and private and nonprofit sources; and (3) consult with other federal, state, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, universities, and private entities that use detection canines, as well as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to encourage domestic breeding of canines and to consolidate canine procurement across the federal government.
