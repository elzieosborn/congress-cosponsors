  <summary date="2006-10-23T21:09:37Z" status="Introduced in House">Paper Ballot Act of 2006 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require a state, for a regularly scheduled general election for President and Vice President, to: (1) conduct the election using only paper ballots; and (2) ensure that the number of ballots cast at a precinct or equivalent location which are placed inside a single box or similar container does not exceed 500.

Requires the ballots cast at a precinct or equivalent location to be counted by hand by election officials at the precinct. Allows a representative of each political party with a candidate on the ballot, as well as any interested member of the public, to observe the officials as they count the ballots.
