    "text": "Ryan Haight Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to prohibit any person from dispensing a prescription drug pursuant to a sale if: (1) any part of the transaction is conducted through an Internet site; (2) the person dispenses the drug by mailing or shipping the drug to the purchaser; and (3) such site fails to provide the identities and licensing information of the seller, pharmacists, or medical consultants.\n\nProhibits a person from selling or dispensing a prescription drug if: (1) the purchaser communicated with the person through the Internet; (2) the purchaser did not have a valid prescription when the communication began; (3) the person provided for the involvement of a practitioner; (4) the practitioner issued a prescription for the drug that was purchased; (5) the person knew that no qualifying medical relationship existed (defines \"qualifying medical relationship\" as requiring an in-person medical evaluation or a medical evaluation as a covering practitioner); and (6) the person received payment. Excludes certain acts involving telemedicine, group practices, and practices that promote the public health.\n\nAllows States to bring civil actions against a person for violations of this Act.\n\nPrevents Internet providers from being held liable for dispensing or selling prescriptions drugs on account of another person's activities.\n\n Includes the dispensing or selling of a prescription drug in violation of this Act as a prohibited act under FFDCA.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award a grant or contract to the National Clearinghouse on Internet Prescribing to identify and report Internet sites that violate Federal or State laws concerning the dispensing of drugs."
