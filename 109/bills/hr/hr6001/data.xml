  <summary date="2006-08-29T20:07:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a system that verifies applicant identity in near-real time to ensure that disaster assistance payments are paid only to qualified individuals.

Requires the Director, in order to determine if an individual is qualified and ensure that the system is efficient, to: (1) establish registration criteria that provides simple but specific instructions to registrants regarding the required information; (2) require registrants to provide their name exactly as it appears on their social security card; (3) test the system prior to implementation; (4) ensure that call center employees give prompt feedback regarding whether the registrant's identity has been validated; and (5) establish an expeditious appeal and alternative verification process for a registrant who is rejected.</summary>
