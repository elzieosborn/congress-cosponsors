  <summary date="2005-12-12T21:28:25Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice for Peace Officers Act - Amends the federal criminal code to prescribe penalties to be imposed on anyone who: (1) murders a federal, state, or local peace officer engaged in, or on account of the performance of, official duties and moves or travels in foreign commerce with intent to avoid prosecution or confinement after conviction of that crime; or (2) is an accessory after the fact to such a crime.

Authorizes the prosecution of such violations only after formal approval in writing, upon consultation with the appropriate state or local prosecutor, by the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, or Assistant Attorney General.

Directs the Secretary of State to notify the Mexican government of the desire of the United States to enter into formal discussions regarding the Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the United Mexican States, signed in Mexico City on May 4, 1978, and available actions that the Mexican government may take to persuade the Mexican Supreme Court to reconsider its October 2001 ruling, so that the possibility of a sentence of life imprisonment will not have an effect on the timely extradition of a criminal suspect from Mexico to the United States.</summary>
