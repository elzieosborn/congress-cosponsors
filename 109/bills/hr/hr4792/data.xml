  <summary date="2006-04-20T14:13:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Fix Medicare Part D Act - Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to repeal provisions prohibiting the Secretary of Health and Human Services from interfering with negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and prescription drug plan sponsors. Requires the Secretary to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered part D drugs to purchase prescription drugs in order to ensure that beneficiaries under Medicare prescription drug plans pay the lowest possible price.

Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2006 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Secretary to promulgate regulations permitting pharmacists, pharmacies, wholesalers, and individuals to import qualifying drugs from certain countries into the United States.

Deems a prescription drug to be misbranded unless the packaging of such drug complies with the requirements for counterfeit-resistant technologies.

Prohibits: (1) failing to register in accordance with this Act; and (2) importing or offering to import a prescription drug in violation of a suspension order.

Declares that selling or importing a patented drug in the United States that was first sold abroad by or under authority of the owner or licensee of the patent is not patent infringement.

Prohibits drug manufacturers from discriminating against a person that engages in the importation of a prescription drug, including by charging higher prices or denying supplies of the drug.

Extends the 2006 annual coordinated election period for enrollment in a Medicare prescription drug plan until November 14, 2006. Suspends until after December 2006 any penalties for late enrollment in such a plan.</summary>
