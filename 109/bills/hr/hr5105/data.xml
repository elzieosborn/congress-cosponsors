  <summary date="2006-05-01T19:45:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Declares that: (1) funding for English language learners provided by Arizona's 47th Legislature's Second Legislative Session is adequate; and (2) any failure of Arizona (or by any agency or subdivision of Arizona) to provide funding in excess of that amount is not a denial of equal educational opportunity under the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, and is not a basis for a civil action, or for relief, against Arizona (or any agency or subdivision).

Makes this Act applicable to litigation pending upon its enactment, including Flores v. Arizona.</summary>
