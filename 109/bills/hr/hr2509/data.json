Requires: (1) the Council to develop a ten-year comprehensive action plan for the Anacostia Watershed in Maryland and the District of Columbia; (2) the EPA Administrator to approve the Council's action plan if it meets the requirements of this Act; (3) the Council to submit annual reports on the Initiative to appropriate committees of Congress; and (4) specified Federal agencies to assist the Initiative.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to provide eligible entities with financial and technical assistance to: (1) conduct research; (2) implement the approved action plan; (3) provide interdisciplinary training; (4) enhance understanding of environmental issues; and (5) develop and disseminate educational resources and opportunities. Limits Federal funds available for such assistance to 75 percent of total project costs.\n\nAmends the WRDA to authorize the Secretary of the Army to provide funding for implementation of a combined sewer overflow control plan in the District of Columbia.\n\nRequires the Secretary, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to establish a program to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal interests in the Anacostia River Basin. Limits the Federal share of funds for such cooperation agreements to 75 percent of total project costs, except that the non-Federal share for operation and maintenance costs shall be 100 percent."
