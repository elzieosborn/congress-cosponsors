  <summary date="2006-12-12T23:29:26Z" status="Introduced in House">R.S. 2477 Rights-Of-Way Recognition Act - Expresses congressional intent with respect to the nature of authorized rights-of-way granted and accepted for the construction of highways (routes over which the public has a right of passage, including routes used for travel, such as roads for motorized vehicles, carriage ways, navigable rivers, trails, and footpaths) over public lands not reserved for public uses under former section 2477 of the Revised Statutes.

Describes the protocols that shall apply with respect to maintenance, repairs, and improvements of R.S. 2477 highways.

Acknowledges and recognizes public rights-of-way over federal land (or any federal-land portion of a public right-of-way over both federal and non-federal land) for highways shown in certain official governmental maps and aerial photographs as having validly vested under R.S. 2477 and disclaims all right, title, and interest with respect thereto.</summary>
