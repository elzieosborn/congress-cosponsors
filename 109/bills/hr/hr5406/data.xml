  <summary date="2006-07-10T20:37:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Suspends the nonimmigrant visitor visa waiver program until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies to Congress that: (1) the automated entry-exit control system is fully implemented and functional; (2) all U.S. ports of entry have functional biometric machine readers; and (3) all nonimmigrants, including Border Crossing Card holders, are processed through the automated entry-exit control system.

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to repeal the machine readable passport (including discretionary waiver) provisions of such program.</summary>
