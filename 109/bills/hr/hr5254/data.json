Requires that at least one such site be designated as potentially suitable for construction of a refinery to refine biomass in order to produce biofuel.\n\nRequires the redevelopment authority, in preparing or revising the redevelopment plan for each such designated installation, to consider the feasibility and practicability of siting a refinery on the installation.\n\nAmends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal certain requirements regarding refinery revitalization."
