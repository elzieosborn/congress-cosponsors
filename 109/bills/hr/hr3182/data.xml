  <summary date="2005-09-29T14:43:14Z" status="Introduced in House">National Water Supply Enhancement Act - Reauthorizes the Water Desalination Act of 1996. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish an advanced water supply enhancement program and fund research, development, and demonstration projects for the development and commercialization of advanced water supply technologies and processes, including desalination.

Requires the Secretary to coordinate with a California federal research facility with experience working with state and local water authorities to carry out water treatment and water quality technology development: (1) focusing on efficient desalination and technologies for selective extraction of contaminants; (2) using resident advanced supercomputer modeling to optimize technology design; and (3) emphasizing unique new technologies, membranes, and materials, excluding incremental development of conventional technologies.

Directs the Secretary and the California facility to work with local water agencies and city governments in carrying out the program to find solutions for local water needs.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) submit a report to Congress that identifies federal research facilities around the United States that could serve as regional centers for water supply enhancement; and (2) conduct a study of the management and disposal of concentrates produced in the production of desalinated waters from coastal water and brackish water and evaluate possible solutions to the management and disposal of concentrates.</summary>
