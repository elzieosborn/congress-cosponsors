Requires coverage of tobacco cessation counseling services for pregnant women, and exempts such services from cost-sharing charges. Covers tobacco cessation medications and counseling for pregnant women, also, under the Maternal and Child Health Services program under SSA title V.\n\nGives states the option under Medicaid to: (1) provide family planning services and supplies to individuals with incomes that do not exceed a state's income eligibility level for medical assistance; and (2) extend the postpartum period for provision of family planning services and supplies.\n\nGives states the option to provide wrap-around SCHIP coverage to children who have other health coverage."
