Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) detain an alien subject to an administrative final order of removal who has been granted a stay of removal during the pendency of such stay; and (2) parole an alien ordered removed and provide that such alien not be detained unless removal becomes foreseeable or the alien violates parole conditions.

Requires that a detention review process be established for aliens under order of removal who have effected an entry and are cooperating with removal.

(Sec. 102) Authorizes indefinite detention of an inadmissible alien until such alien is subject to an administrative final order of removal. States that habeas corpus review of such provision shall be available only in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after exhaustion of administrative remedies.

Title II: Criminal Alien Removal Act - (Sec. 201) Provides for expedited removal of aliens removable on criminal grounds.

Defines: (1) criminal street gang; and (2) gang crime.

Makes an alien deportable who: (1) is a street gang member convicted of committing or attempting to commit a gang crime; or (2) is determined by the Secretary to be a member of a designated criminal street gang.
