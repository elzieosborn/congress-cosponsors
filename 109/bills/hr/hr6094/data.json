States that habeas corpus review of such provision shall be available only in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n\nTitle II: Criminal Alien Removal Act - (Sec. 201) Provides for expedited removal of aliens removable on criminal grounds.\n\nTitle III: Alien Gang Removal Act of 2006 - (Sec. 301) Makes an alien inadmissible for U.S. entry if: (1) such alien has been deported for criminal street gang participation; or (2) the consular officer or the Secretary knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that such alien is a member of a criminal street gang seeking U.S. entry in furtherance of gang-related crimes or activities or is a member of a designated criminal street gang.\n\nDefines: (1) criminal street gang; and (2) gang crime.\n\nMakes an alien deportable who: (1) is a street gang member convicted of committing or attempting to commit a gang crime; or (2) is determined by the Secretary to be a member of a designated criminal street gang.\n\nAuthorizes the Attorney General to designate a group or association as a criminal street gang. Requires the Attorney General to provide specified congressional leaders with prior notice of, and the factual basis for, such designation.\n\nProvides for revocation of such designation by: (1) an Act of Congress; (2) the Attorney General's review based upon changed circumstances or national security; or (3) judicial appeal or petition to the Attorney General by a gang or association so designated.\n\n(Sec. 302) Requires mandatory detention of aliens subject to removal based upon criminal street gang membership.\n\n(Sec. 303) Makes such aliens ineligible for asylum and protection from removal to certain countries."
