Authorizes the Administrator of General Services, in carrying out duties relating to the acquisition, construction, and alteration of public buildings and works, to: (1) repair a public building; (2) repair any building, or part of the building, that is under lease by the federal government for use for a public purpose; and (3) lease space for use for a public purpose, without approval of a prospectus, if the lease or repair is required as a result of damages to buildings or property attributable to Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita.

Requires: (1) the Administrator to submit to specified congressional committees initial and final reports on such repairs; (2) lease agreements entered into under this Act to be for a term of five years or less; and (3) the Administrator to submit to such committees reports on such leases.

Declares that the authority provided by this Act to enter into an agreement for a repair or lease shall cease to be effective on the day that is one year after the date of enactment of this Act.</summary>
