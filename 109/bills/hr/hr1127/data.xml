  <summary date="2005-04-04T16:58:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Renewable Energy Production Incentive Reform and Reauthorization Act - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to revise requirements for the program of renewable energy production incentive payments. Requires payment to the owner or operator of qualified renewable energy facilities by: (1) the Secretary of Energy for electric energy generated and sold from solar, wind, or geothermal energy; (2) the Secretary of Agriculture for electric energy generated and sold from biomass (unless the electric energy is generated from heat derived from landfill gases); and (3) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for electric energy generated and sold from heat derived from landfill gases.

Prohibits such officials from establishing criteria or procedures that have the effect of assigning to an eligible, qualified renewable energy facility a higher or lower priority for eligibility or allocation of payments on the basis of the energy source used at such facility.

Identifies the eligibility window for such payments as occurring before October 1, 2016.

Increases the per kilowatt hour incentive payment.

Extends the program through September 30, 2026.</summary>
