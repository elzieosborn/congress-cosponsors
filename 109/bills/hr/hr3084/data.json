    "text": "Drug Free Sports Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations requiring professional sports associations to adopt and enforce policies and procedures for the random testing of athletes (a minimum of five times throughout each year, without advance notification) for the use of performance-enhancing substances. Requires the Secretary to: (1) prescribe the substances for which each athlete is to be tested and include prohibited substances as determined by the World Anti-Doping Agency and substances designed to conceal the presence of performance-enhancing substances in the body; (2) establish criteria for exemptions for documented legitimate medical or therapeutic usage; (3) establish criteria for tests to be administered by an independent party; and (4) establish criteria for suspension reduction for an athlete who has tested positive but who establishes that he or she bears no fault or negligence or no significant fault or negligence.\n\nDirects that the penalty for a positive test result is suspension for one-half of the season of play for the first violation, one full season of play for the second violation, and permanent suspension for a third violation. Requires disclosure to the public of the name of any athlete that tests positive. Provides for an opportunity for a prompt hearing and an appeal before an arbiter.\n\nAllows the Secretary to fine any such association for failure to adopt and enforce testing policies and procedures consistent with the regulations.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to study the testing policies and practices for the use of performance-enhancing substances by college and secondary school athletes."
