  <summary date="2006-11-28T16:38:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2006 - Amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to revise the definition of disability and to define: (1) physical impairment; (2) mental impairment; (3) record of physical or mental impairment; and (4) perceived physical or mental impairment.

States a rule of construction that the existence of such an impairment, record, or perception shall be determined without taking into account an individual's use of mitigating measures or whether the impairment is episodic, short term, or long term.

Provides that it may be a defense to a charge of discrimination that the individual with a disability alleging discrimination is not a qualified individual as defined in such Act.

Declares that this Act shall be broadly construed to advance its remedial purpose of providing a comprehensive prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability.</summary>
