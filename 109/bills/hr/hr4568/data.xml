  <summary date="2006-01-13T21:20:50Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Proficiency Testing Improvement Act of 2005 - Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from conducting laboratory proficiency testing of individuals involved in screening or interpreting cytological preparations for one year.

Requires the Secretary, within one year and before resuming testing, to revise such proficiency testing to: (1) reflect the collaborative clinical decision-making of laboratory personnel involved in screening or interpreting cytological preparations; (2) revise grading or scoring criteria to reflect current practice guidelines; (3) provide for such testing to be conducted no more than every two years; and (4) make such other revisions as necessary to reflect changes in laboratory operations and practices since the standards were promulgated.</summary>
