More Border Patrol Agents Now Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to the House Committees on Homeland Security and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs a plan to determine how the Border Patrol can better recruit and retain agents with the appropriate skills and training.

Requires such plan to include: (1) recruitment and retention strategies; and (2) assessments of the impact of pay levels and duty station transfer opportunities upon recruitment and retention.

Amends federal law to authorize the Secretary (for five years) to pay a: (1) bonus to an individual to recruit Border Patrol agents; and (2) retention bonus to Border Patrol agents.

States that such bonuses shall: (1) not exceed 25% of the annual rate of basic pay of the position involved; (2) be paid in a lump-sum and not be considered part of basic pay; and (3) be contingent upon the individual entering into a written service agreement with the Border Patrol.

Authorizes the Secretary (for five years) to appoint annuitants to Border Patrol positions. Excludes such positions from specified offsets. Prohibits appointments that would displace any Border Patrol employee.</summary>
