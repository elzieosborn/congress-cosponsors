The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nTwenty-First Century Water Commission Act of 2005 - Establishes the Twenty-First Century Water Commission to: (1) project future water supply and demand; (2) study current water management programs of federal, interstate, state, and local agencies and private sector entities directed at increasing water supplies and improving the availability, reliability, and quality of freshwater resources; and (3) consult with representatives of such agencies and entities to develop recommendations for a comprehensive water strategy. Requires that such strategy: (1) respect the primary role of states in adjudicating, administering, and regulating water rights and uses; (2) identify incentives intended to ensure an adequate and dependable water supply to meet U.S. needs for the next 50 years; (3) suggest strategies that avoid increased mandates on state and local governments; (4) eliminate duplication and conflict among federal programs; (5) consider all available technologies to optimize water supply reliability, availability, and quality, while safeguarding the environment; (6) recommend means of capturing excess water and flood water for conservation and use in the event of a drought; (7) suggest financing options for comprehensive water management projects and appropriate public works projects; and (8) suggest strategies to conserve existing water supplies, including recommendations for repairing aging infrastructure.\n\nSets forth requirements for semiannual interim reports and a final report within three years. Authorizes appropriations."
