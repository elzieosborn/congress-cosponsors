Sets forth minimum deployable recorder capabilities.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) purchase and make available, at no cost, to an air carrier such deployable recorder systems as may be necessary for it to comply with regulations; and (2) reimburse aircraft manufacturers owned or controlled by a U.S. citizen for engineering, certification, and installation costs incurred in developing and installing deployable recorder systems to comply with regulations."
