  <summary date="2005-02-24T20:56:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Judicial District of the Virgin Islands Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a two-judge Article III court in the Virgin Islands (with court held in Christiansted for the Saint Croix Division, and in Charlotte-Amalie for the Saint Thomas and Saint John Division). Requires pleadings and procedures to be conducted in the English language.

Amends the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to state that: (1) the judicial power of the Virgin Islands shall be vested in an appellate court and lower local courts as may have been or may hereafter be established by local law (eliminates references to the district court of the Virgin Islands); and (2) the U.S. district court of the Virgin Islands shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all income-tax related criminal and civil proceedings in the Virgin Islands, except for ancillary tax laws enacted by the Virgin Islands legislature.

Sets forth provisions respecting: (1) assignment of additional judges; and (2) relations between U.S. courts and local courts under such Act.</summary>
