    "text": "Community College Partnership Act of 2005 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a community college opportunity program to help students at community or technical colleges to transfer to four-year institutions and complete bachelor's degrees.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Education to award program grants to eligible partnerships that include one or more community or technical colleges that award associate's degrees and one or more institutions of higher education that offer a baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate degree not awarded by the partner colleges. Requires funds from such grants to be used for: (1) development of policies to expand opportunities for community or technical college students to earn bachelor's degrees, including transfer of academic credits between institutions and expanded articulation and guaranteed transfer agreements; (2) support services to students participating in the program, including tutoring, mentoring, academic and personal counseling, and transition facilitation; (3) need-based scholarships to transfer students for their third and fourth years of undergraduate education; (4) academic program enhancements at the community or technical college that increase program quality and the number of student participants in the dual degree program offered in conjunction with a baccalaureate degree-granting institution; and (5) programs to identify barriers that inhibit student transfers."
