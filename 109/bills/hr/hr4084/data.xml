  <summary date="2006-10-26T15:13:03Z" status="Reported to House without amendment, Part I">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) 

Amends the Forest Service use and occupancy permit program to require amounts collected in connection with the issuance of a special use permit for a marina at a unit of the National Forest System (NFS) derived from the public domain to be deposited in an existing special account in the Treasury established for the Secretary of Agriculture for specified recreation management purposes. Prohibits the Secretary from using such amounts for biological monitoring for listed or candidate species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Requires at least 80% of the permit fees collected at a specific unit of the NFS to be expended for that unit and permits the Secretary to transfer up to 20% of such fees to appropriations available to enhance recreation opportunities at other NFS units.</summary>
