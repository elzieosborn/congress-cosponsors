Sets forth special rules for funds reserved to support monthly caseworker visits, including requirements for state submission of data on: (1) frequency and location of such visits; and (2) state ability to verify visit frequency.\n\n(Sec. 5) Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for child welfare services (CWS).\n\nModifies state plan as well as state allotment and reimbursement requirements under the CWS program.\n\nRepeals requirements that a state CWS plan apply certain child day care standards and provide for training and effective use of paraprofessionals.
