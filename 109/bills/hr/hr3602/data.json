    "text": "Literacy, Education, and Rehabilitation Act - Amends the federal criminal code to allow a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment of more than one year (other than life imprisonment) to receive credit beyond time already served of up to 60 days each year, in addition to any credit received for satisfactory behavior, for earning a certificate of completion in, or for participating in or teaching, a designated program which benefits prisoners or the Bureau of Prisons. Includes specified educational and vocational, treatment, or work and developmental programs.\n\nRequires the Director of the Bureau to establish the number of days of credit a prisoner may be awarded considering the difficulty, time required, responsibility expected, and rehabilitative benefits of the program.\n\n Makes any person sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the Attorney General's custody eligible for the credits, including prisoners transferred from foreign countries.\n\nDirects the Bureau to assure that a prisoner spends a reasonable part of the last portion (currently, the last ten percent) of the term of imprisonment to be served under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to prepare for reentry into the community."
