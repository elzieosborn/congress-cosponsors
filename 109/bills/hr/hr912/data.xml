  <summary date="2005-03-08T20:10:46Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Humanitarian Assistance Code of Conduct Act of 2005 - Prohibits the obligation of specified funds for foreign operations, export financing, and related programs to an organization that fails to adopt a code of conduct that provides for the protection of beneficiaries of assistance from sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian relief operations.

Requires the code of conduct, to the maximum extent practicable, to be consistent with the following six core principles of the United Nations (UN) Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on Protection From Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises: (1) sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment; (2) sexual activity with children (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the local age of majority or consent; (3) exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favors or other forms of humiliating or exploitative behavior, is prohibited; (4) sexual relationships between humanitarian workers and beneficiaries are strongly discouraged; (5) where a humanitarian worker develops concerns or suspicions regarding sexual abuse or exploitation by a fellow worker he or she must report such concerns via established agency reporting mechanisms; and (6) humanitarian agencies are obliged to maintain an environment which prevents sexual exploitation and abuse and promotes the implementation of their code of conduct.</summary>
