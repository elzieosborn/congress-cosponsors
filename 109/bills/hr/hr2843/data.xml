  <summary date="2005-06-24T16:41:58Z" status="Introduced in House">Prohibits a railroad carrier from operating or causing to be operated a remote control locomotive to carry hazardous materials.

Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue a rule requiring that: (1) railroad carriers inventory and maintain continuous accounting of remote control transmitters, such transmitters be kept in a secure location when not in use, and be assigned only to personnel with proper identification and authorization to use them; and (2) the manual operational control area of any remote control locomotive be kept under lock and key when such locomotive is operated without personnel of the railroad carrier present.

Sets forth civil penalties for a railroad carrier that violates such requirements, including criminal penalties if such violation involves the release of a hazardous material that results in death or bodily injury.</summary>
