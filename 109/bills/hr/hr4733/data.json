Requires initiation of an investigation only if a satisfactory resolution of such practices has not been reached.\n\nRequires the Congressional Trade Enforcer: (1) to identify and report to Congress on priority foreign trade practices of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Russian Federation, and the European Union; and (2) as part of the report's analysis, to consider violations by the PRC and the Russian Federation of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules regarding the protection of intellectual property rights, violations by the PRC of WTO rules regarding the manipulation of currency, and violations by the European Union of WTO rules regarding discriminatory regional trade agreements."
