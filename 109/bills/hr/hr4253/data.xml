  <summary date="2005-12-19T21:23:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Illegal Alien Transport and Removal Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to contract with private entities to provide secure domestic transport of aliens who are apprehended at or along the international land or maritime borders from Border Patrol custody to detention facilities and other locations as necessary.

 States that the extension of removal period provision under the Immigration and Nationality Act shall not be construed as preventing the Secretary from removing an alien from the United States if the alien has failed or refused to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien's departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien's removal subject to an order of removal.</summary>
