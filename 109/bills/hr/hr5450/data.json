    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 29, 2006. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Act - (Sec. 3) Reestablishes in the Department of Commerce the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), headed by an Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, who shall serve as the Administrator of NOAA.\n\nEstablishes within NOAA the positions of: (1) Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere; (2) Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere; (3) Deputy Assistant Secretary for Science and Education; (4) up to two additional Deputy Assistant Secretaries; and (5) General Counsel.\n\n(Sec. 5) Maintains within NOAA: (1) the National Weather Service; (2) programs to support efforts, on a continuing basis, to collect data and provide information and products regarding satellites, observations, and coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes information; and (3) programs to conduct and support research and education and the development of technologies relating to weather, climate, and the coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes.\n\n(Sec. 8) Establishes a Science Advisory Board within NOAA.\n\n(Sec. 9) Requires the Administrator, not later than one year after enactment of this Act, and once every five years thereafter, to: (1) provide a review of NOAA environmental data and information systems, including recommendations to address any inadequacies identified by the review; (2) develop a strategic plan that responds to such recommendations and sets forth modernization and improvement objectives for an integrated national environmental data access and archive system; and (3) develop a strategic plan for science and technology research and development (R&D) at NOAA.\n\n(Sec. 10) Requires the Administrator, not less than once every five years, to develop, and submit to Congress, a policy on the roles of NOAA, the private sector, and the academic community in providing environmental information, products, technologies, and services.\n\n(Sec. 11) Terminates the Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 (the executive order that established NOAA).\n\n(Sec. 13) Requires the Administrator, not later than 18 months after enactment of this Act, to develop and submit to Congress a reorganization plan for NOAA.\n\n(Sec. 14) Prohibits the Administrator from closing, consolidating, relocating, subdividing, or establishing a facility of NOAA unless there has been specified prior public and congressional notification, and an assessment, of any proposed changes.\n\n(Sec. 16) Establishes certain baselines and cost controls before NOAA can enter into a contract for the development of a major program. Requires: (1) the Administrator to submit to Congress a Major Program Annual Report, including a Baseline Report, for each major program that NOAA proposes to expend funds in the subsequent fiscal year; and (2) notification to Congress when certain cost increases or schedule delays occur in a major program.\n\n(Sec. 17) Prohibits, except as provided, a NOAA activity or function that is converted to contractor performance under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 from being performed by the contractor or any subcontractor at a location outside of the United States.\n\nProhibits a contract for the procurement of goods and services that is entered into by the Administrator from being performed outside the United States unless it is to meet a requirement of NOAA for goods or services specifically at a location outside the United States, unless: (1) it is necessary for U.S. national security; (2) essential goods or services under the contract are only available from a source outside the United States; (3) the activity or function was previously performed by federal employees outside the United States; or (4) the prohibition is inconsistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements.\n\n(Sec. 18) Requires the Administrator to submit annual reports to Congress on the contracts and subcontracts performed overseas and amount of purchases by NOAA from foreign entities."
