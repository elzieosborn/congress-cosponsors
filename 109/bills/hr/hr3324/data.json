Sets forth application requirements.\n\nAuthorizes the Attorney General, through BJA, to make grants to states, Indian tribal governments, and multijurisdictional or regional consortia to develop a comprehensive, cooperative strategy to address the use, sale, and manufacture of methamphetamine. Allocates funding for enforcement.\n\nAuthorizes the Attorney General to: (1) collect systematic data on the effectiveness of programs assisted under this Act; (2) establish a national clearinghouse of information on effective programs for dissemination to state and local agencies; (3) establish a program within the Department of Justice to facilitate the sharing of best practices among states; and (4) provide technical assistance to state and local agencies.\n\nUrges the President to seek commitments from the Canadian Government to take effective measures to stem the availability of pseudoephedrine in Canada and its illegal importation into the United States."
