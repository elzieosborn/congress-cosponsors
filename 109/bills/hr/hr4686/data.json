    "text": "Multi-State and International Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 2006 - Reauthorizes through FY2012: (1) the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, including authorization of appropriations to the Department of Commerce for management of interjurisdictional fishery resources and the development of interstate fishery management plans for interjurisdictional fishery resources; (2) the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act, including authorization of appropriations for preservation of fishery resources; (3) the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975, including authorization of appropriations for the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and including use for the payment of the U.S. share of the joint expenses of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas; and (4) the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995, including authorization of appropriations for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention and including use for the payment of the U.S. contribution to the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization.\n\nReauthorizes through FY2016 the Dungeness Crab Fishery Management Act of 1996, allowing the states of Washington, Oregon, and California to enforce state laws governing fishing and processing of Dungeness crab fisheries where there is no fishery management plan in effect. Requires the Pacific State Marine Fisheries Commission to report biennially to Congress on the status and management of the Dungeness Crab fishery located off the coasts of such states, including stock status and trends throughout its range, a description of research and scientific review processes used to determine such stock status and trends, and measures implemented or planned to prevent or end overfishing in the fishery.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. Commissioners to the Atlantic Tunas Convention should seek to include ecosystem and conservation of fish habitat considerations in fisheries management."
