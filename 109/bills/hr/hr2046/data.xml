  <summary date="2005-08-01T19:57:24Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 19, 2005. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Servicemembers' Health Insurance Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to entitle a servicemember ordered to active duty, upon release from active duty, to reinstatement of health insurance in effect on the day before service commenced without any premium increase for the balance of the period for which there would have been coverage had it not been terminated. Permits a health care insurance carrier to increase a servicemember's premium if there was general premium increase for similarly covered individuals during the period between the termination and the reinstatement.

Amends the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) to preserve employer-sponsored health plan reinstatement rights for certain Reserve-component members who prior to entering active duty acquire TRICARE (a Department of Defense managed health care program) eligibility.

Makes technical corrections to the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004.

Amends the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief Act, 2005 to repeal provisions revising codified law concerning elections of members to reduce or decline insurance, and the redesignation of beneficiaries, under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program. Reinstates the codified provisions as if such amendments had not been enacted.

Requires that, whenever a member eligible for SGLI insurance executes a life insurance option (an option not to be insured, to be insured for less than the maximum coverage amount, or to designate a person other than a spouse or child as a beneficiary), the Secretary of the military department concerned shall notify the member's spouse or (if not married) next of kin of the execution of such option. Requires that, whenever an unmarried member who is eligible for such insurance marries, the Secretary concerned shall notify the member's spouse as to whether the member is insured under SGLI, what insurance coverage elections the member has made, and whether the member has designated a beneficiary other that the spouse or a child of such member.</summary>
