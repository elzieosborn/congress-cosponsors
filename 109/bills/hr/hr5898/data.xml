Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to identify: (1) lands adjacent to the Park that are suitable for inclusion within the boundaries of the Park; and (2) lands within the Park boundary that should be removed from such boundary due to development or other changes in their status that make them unsuitable for inclusion within it.
