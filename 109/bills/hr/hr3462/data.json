The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Interior to convey to Park City, Utah, two parcels of property located in Park City that are currently under the management jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and known as the White Acre and Gambel Oak properties.\n\nRequires such conveyance to be made by a deed or deeds containing a restriction requiring that the lands be maintained as open space and used only for public recreation purposes or other purposes consistent with their maintenance as open space. Prohibits interpreting this restriction as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of recreational facilities, utilities, or other structures that are consistent with the maintenance of such lands as open space or its use for public recreation purposes.\n\nRequires Park City to pay to the Secretary an amount consistent with conveyances to governmental entities for recreational purposes under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act.\n\nDirects the Secretary to offer for sale two specified parcels of property located in Park City that are currently under the management jurisdiction of the BLM. Requires such land sale to be consistent with specified provisions under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 through a competitive bidding process and for not less than fair market value. Sets forth requirements for the disposition and use of the proceeds derived from such sale, including providing for the use of such proceeds for environmental restoration projects on BLM-administered lands within the BLM Salt Lake City Field Office."
