    "text": "Restricting Indian Gaming to Homelands of Tribes Act of 2006 - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to revise requirements for gaming on lands taken in trust for the benefit of a newly recognized, restored, or landless Indian tribe.\n\nAllows one Indian tribe to host another, invited tribe to participate in or benefit from consolidated class II and class III gaming within the boundaries of the host tribe's reservation.\n\nRequires the Indian tribe, in order to mitigate the direct impact of gaming activities on the affected county or parish infrastructure and services, to negotiate and sign, during negotiations for a tribal-state gaming compact, a memorandum of understanding concerning mitigation with the county or parish government. Requires the Secretary to appoint an arbitrator to establish mitigation requirements if such a memorandum is not signed within one year after a request to initiate negotiations has been made.\n\nProvides that any gaming authorized by this Act shall not be conducted unless it is: (1) consistent with the tribal-state compacting laws of the state in which the gaming activities will be conducted; and (2) specifically identified as expressly authorized in a tribal-state compact of the invited Indian tribe approved by an Act of the legislature and the Governor of the state in which the gaming will be conducted.\n\nStates that host tribe compacts shall not be affected by the amendments made by this Act.\n\nProhibits an Indian tribe from conducting regulated gaming on Indian lands outside the state in which the Indian tribe is primarily residing and exercising tribal government authority upon the enactment of this Act, unless such lands are contiguous to those in the state where the tribe is primarily residing and exercising such authority.\n\nDeclares that the gaming arrangement authorized by this Act shall not be conducted on any Indian lands within the state of Arizona."
