  <summary date="2005-04-30T17:19:56Z" status="Introduced in House">9/11 Can You Hear Me Now Act - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to procure development and provision of a communications system for the New York City Fire Department, including appropriate radios and upgrades to the Department's critical information dispatch system that allow communication in all locations and under all conditions in which firefighters can reasonably be expected to work.

Directs that any communications system procured include provision to each firefighter of a supplemental radio communication device that: (1) allows the firefighter to transmit emergency notification warning signals to other firefighters; and (2) has the capability to operate automatically by transmitting messages that will relay an incapacitated firefighter's identification and location.

Requires that upgrades procured: (1) provide useful, detailed data concerning all likely terrorist target locations in the city; and (2) be capable of providing to responding firefighters, instantaneously, details about particular buildings and other locations to assist in making decisions about how to mitigate a terrorist attack.

Requires that: (1) radios, any dispatch system upgrades, and supplemental communication devices procured be tested; and (2) the Secretary coordinate with the city to ensure that the communications system procured is compatible with city plans to upgrade its 911 system and interoperable with other public safety communications systems.</summary>
