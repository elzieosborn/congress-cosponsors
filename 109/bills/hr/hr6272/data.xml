  <summary date="2006-11-01T22:17:46Z" status="Introduced in House">Enhanced Emergency and Enforcement Authority Act - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to empower the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reduce, eliminate, or prevent substantial disruption by an emergency of the ability of market participants to conduct securities activities or comply with obligations under the securities laws in a timely, orderly, or efficient manner.

Amends the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Company Act of 1940 to provide that, in any action or proceeding instituted by the SEC in federal district court for any judicial district, subpoenas issued by or on behalf of such court to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents or tangible things (or both) may be served in any other district (thus granting the SEC nationwide service of process).</summary>
