  <summary date="2006-05-26T18:24:58Z" status="Introduced in House">Summer Relief for Motorists Act of 2006 - Expresses the sense of Congress that states can assist motorists by temporarily suspending state gasoline taxes without jeopardizing their commitment to transportation infrastructure investment.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to suspend excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene from the enactment of this Act until September 4, 2006 (suspension period). Provides for reimbursement to the Highway Trust Fund and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for tax revenues lost during the suspension period.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the application of any federal law exempting crude oil and natural gas producers from the payment of royalties for production activities on federal lands during periods when the average price of crude oil exceeds $35.86 per barrel and the average wellhead price of natural gas exceeds $4.48 per 1,000 cubic feet.</summary>
