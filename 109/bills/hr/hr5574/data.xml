  <summary date="2006-10-19T20:45:10Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on September 26, 2006. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2006 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make payments for FY2007-FY2011 (currently, through FY2005) to children's hospitals for expenses associated with operating approved graduate medical residency training programs; and (2) decrease from 26 to 12 the number of interim payments to hospitals per fiscal year.

Requires a 25% reduction in the amount payable for residency training programs for children's hospitals that do not provide an annual report to the Secretary for the previous fiscal year or that do not provide an annual report that includes all of the required information. Requires an annual report to include: (1) the types of residency training programs that the hospital provided for residents; (2) the number of training positions for residents; (3) the changes the hospital made in residency training for residents during the academic year; and (4) the number of residents who completed their residency training at the end of the academic year and care for children within the borders of the service area of the hospital or within the state. Requires the Secretary to provide notice and an opportunity for a hospital to provide additional information before imposing the reduction.

Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to report to Congress on the residency training programs.</summary>
