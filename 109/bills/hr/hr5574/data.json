Requires an annual report to include: (1) the types of residency training programs that the hospital provided for residents; (2) the number of training positions for residents; (3) the changes the hospital made in residency training for residents during the academic year; and (4) the number of residents who completed their residency training at the end of the academic year and care for children within the borders of the service area of the hospital or within the state.
