    "text": "Fueling the U.S.A. Through Unlimited Reliable Energy Act of 2005 - Declares that it shall be the policy of the United States to conduct research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities to provide for the scientific, engineering, and commercial infrastructure necessary to ensure that the United States is competitive with other nations in providing fusion energy for its own needs and the needs of other nations, including by demonstrating electric power or hydrogen production for the United States energy grid utilizing fusion energy at the earliest date possible.\n\nInstructs the Secretary of Energy to transmit to Congress a plan meeting specified requirements for carrying out such policy.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary, subject to certain guidelines, to negotiate an agreement for U.S. participation in ITER (international burning plasma fusion research project).\n\nDirects the Secretary to develop a plan for the participation of U.S. scientists in ITER that includes the U.S. research agenda for ITER, methods to evaluate whether ITER is promoting progress toward making fusion a reliable and affordable source of power, and a description of how work at ITER will relate to other elements of the domestic fusion program.\n\nDirects the Secretary to send to Congress a plan for implementing a domestic burning plasma experiment such as Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE), if at any time during the negotiations on ITER the Secretary determines that construction and operation of ITER is unlikely or infeasible."
