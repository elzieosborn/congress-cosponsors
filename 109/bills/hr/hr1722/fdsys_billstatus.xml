        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Directs the Secretary of Education to revise certain regulations to increase, from one to three percent, the number of proficient and advanced level scores based on alternate assessments and alternate achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities that may be counted in calculating adequate yearly progress (AYP) for schools, local educational agencies, and States, under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (ESEA-NCLBA).</p> <p>Amends ESEA-NCLBA to lower from ten to seven percent the amount of the decrease, in the percentage in a school year from the preceding school year, of students in any of specified groups who did not meet or exceed the proficient level of academic achievement on the State assessments, which is required under certain conditions for a school to be considered to have made AYP.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to issue policy guidance directing that the assessment results of first-year and second-year limited English proficiency students who are recently resettled refugees and who take the reading-language arts assessment are not required to be included in AYP determinations, even if such students have been enrolled in the school or district for one or two full academic years.</p>]]></text>
