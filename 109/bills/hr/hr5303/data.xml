  <summary date="2006-05-26T15:32:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Depleted Uranium Munitions Suspension and Study Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Defense to direct that all elements of the Department of Defense (DOD) suspend use of depleted uranium munitions until the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) certifies to certain congressional committees that use of such munitions in future conflicts: (1) will not pose a likely long-term or residual threat to the health of U.S. or NATO military personnel; and (2) will not jeopardize the health of civilian populations in the area of such use.

Suspends federal approval of the foreign sale or export of munitions containing depleted uranium until the Secretary of HHS has made such certification.

Limits future exports to stocks certified free of transuranic matter by the Secretary of Defense.

Requires the Comptroller General to investigate and report to Congress on the contamination of stocks of depleted uranium munitions with transuranic elements.

Requires the Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention jointly to conduct a comprehensive study of the health effects of exposure to depleted uranium munitions on veterans and on their children born after their respective exposures to uranium.

Directs the Secretary of Defense to provide to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Administrator) a list and maps of all sites in the United States where depleted uranium munitions have been used or produced.

Requires the Administrator to study and report to Congress and the Secretary of Defense on the possible depleted uranium contamination of the soil, air, water, and vegetation of each listed site.

Directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for mitigation and cleanup at each site.</summary>
