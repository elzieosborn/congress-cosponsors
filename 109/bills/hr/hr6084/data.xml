  <summary date="2006-10-11T20:08:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Income-Dependent Education Assistance Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Education to conduct a direct income-dependent education assistance (IDEA) loan program, from July 1, 2007, through July 1, 2013, under which student borrowers of Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) or Direct Loans (DL), under parts B and D of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, may elect to convert or consolidate such loans to direct IDEA loans. Provides that when a student defaults on a loan under the FFEL or DL programs and it is repaid or canceled by the Secretary, it is thereby converted to a direct IDEA loan.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to collect IDEA loan repayments through the income tax withholding system.</summary>
