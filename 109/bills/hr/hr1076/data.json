    "text": "Detention of Enemy Combatants Act - Authorizes the detention of a U.S. person or resident (excluding a prisoner of war) as an enemy combatant if that individual is an al Qaeda member or knowingly cooperated with an al Qaeda member in planning, authorizing, committing, aiding, or abetting a terrorist act against the United States. Directs the Secretary of Defense to prescribe, publish, and report the standards, process, and criteria: (1) to be used in determining that an American citizen or lawful resident is an enemy combatant; and (2) for that individual's detention. Requires rules for the detention of enemy combatants to: (1) establish clear standards and procedures that meet specified requirements, including preserving the Government's ability to detain those who may threaten the United States; and (2) guarantee timely access to judicial review and permit the detainee access to counsel.Authorizes a U.S. person to be detained as an enemy combatant only while there is in effect a presidential certification that: (1) the U.S. armed forces are in a state of armed conflict with al Qaeda and an investigation, prosecution, or post-trial proceeding regarding such person is ongoing; or (2) detention is warranted to prevent such individual from aiding persons attempting to commit terrorist acts against the United States.Grants the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction to review any detention under this Act.Requires that detainees be: (1) detained at an appropriate location; (2) treated humanely; (3) afforded adequate food, water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment; (4) sheltered under hygienic conditions; and (5) allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with specified requirements."
