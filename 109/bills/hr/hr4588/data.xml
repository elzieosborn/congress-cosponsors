  <summary date="2007-02-02T21:06:37Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on December 6, 2006. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Water Resources Research Act Amendments of 2006 - Amends the Water Resources Research Act of 1984 to require research by state water resources research and technology institutes to be applied and peer reviewed research that fosters improvements in water supply reliability and the entry of new research engineers and technicians into water resources fields.

Directs the Secretary to evaluate each institute at least once every three (currently, five) years and requires that such evaluation determine institute effectiveness at producing measured results and applied water supply research.

 Authorizes appropriations for such institutes for FY2007-FY2011.

Requires the Secretary, as part of the annual budget submission to Congress, to provide a crosscut budget detailing expenditures on institute activities and a report on the level of applied research and the results of the activities authorized by such Act, including increases in annual water supplies, increases in annual water yields, advances in water infrastructure and water quality improvements, and methods for identifying and determining the effectiveness of treatment technologies and efficiencies.

Limits amounts that may be utilized for administrative costs to 7.5% (currently, 15%) of appropriated sums.</summary>
