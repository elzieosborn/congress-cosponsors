    "text": "America's Partnership for Nursing Education Act of 2006 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to qualifying states to increase the number of faculty at collegiate schools of nursing to alleviate the shortage of nurses. Sets forth conditions to be a qualifying state, including that the state: (1) has a population increase of more than 50% between 1995 and 2005; (2) is projected to have fewer than 555 nurses per 100,000 residents by 2020; and (3) has a program in place, as of January 1, 2006, to assist in increasing the number of faculty at such schools of nursing. Allows such a grant to be used for collegiate school of nursing salaries, benefits, training, and related expenses. Prohibits such a grant from being expended for any capital expenses."
