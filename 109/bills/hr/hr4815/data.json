Authorizes the Task Force to carry out demonstration programs in five selected jurisdictions to: (1) use the Task Force's preliminary guidelines to implement such a system for their sex offender registries; and (2) identify ways to improve such guidelines. Expresses the sense of Congress that each state, federally recognized Indian tribe, and U.S. possession and territory should use final Task Force guidelines to implement such a system for its registry."
