  <summary date="2005-11-08T17:49:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to authorize the head of an executive agency, during a national emergency or major disaster, to use procurement procedures other than competitive procedures when necessary to facilitate the response to, or recovery from, the national emergency or major disaster. Allows such agency head to apply specified provisions of law as if the property or services to be acquired are commercial items.

Authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to accept the services of volunteers and provide for their incidental expenses in carrying out FEMA activities other than policymaking or law or regulatory enforcement.</summary>
