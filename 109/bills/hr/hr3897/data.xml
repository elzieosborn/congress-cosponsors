  <summary date="2006-08-01T18:17:49Z" status="Passed House amended">Madera Water Supply Enhancement Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of constructing the Madera Water Supply and Enhancement Project. Limits the federal share of the cost of the study to 50%.

Requires all planning, design, and construction of the Project to be undertaken in accordance with a cooperative agreement between the Secretary and the Madera Irrigation District, California.

Authorizes the Secretary, upon determining that the Project is feasible, to enter into a cooperative agreement through the Bureau with the District for the support of the design and construction of the Project. Limits the federal share of the capital costs of the Project to 25%. Directs the Secretary, before obligating funds, to work cooperatively to use plans, designs, and engineering and environmental analyses that have already been prepared by the District for the Project.

Terminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this Act 10 years after its enactment.</summary>
