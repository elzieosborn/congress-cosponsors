  <summary date="2006-12-05T22:12:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Troops to Teachers Improvement Act of 2006 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 with respect to the Troops-to-Teachers program (which provides armed forces veterans with teacher certification stipends in exchange for three years of service in a high-need local educational agency (LEA) or public charter school).

Allows a program participant, if a high-need LEA or public charter school is not located within 50 miles of his or her residence, to teach within an LEA or at a public charter school: (1) experiencing a shortage of highly qualified teachers, especially in science, mathematics, special education, or vocational or technical education; or (2) receiving grant funds because of concentrations of children from low-income families.</summary>
