Allows funds to be treated as non-Federal, private funds of the College.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations to the College for: (1) operation and maintenance, to be funded by the Secretary separately from funding institutions under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978; and (2) facilities and capital projects, to be funded through any of specified Federal agencies.\n\nSupersedes and repeals the Navajo Community College Act."
