    "text": "National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006 - Title I: NIH Reform - (Sec. 101) Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and reorganize the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including by: (1) renaming NIH agencies as national research institutes or national centers; (2) establishing a Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (the Division); and (3) placing specified offices within the authority of the Division, including the Office of AIDS Research and the Office of Dietary Supplements. Allows the Director of NIH to establish additional offices or administrative units within the Division. Sets at 27 the maximum number of national research institutes and national centers that NIH may have. Authorizes the Director, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to reorganize the offices within the Office of the Director if the Director determines that the management and operation of NIH programs and activities would be more efficiently carried out. Sets forth process for any future reorganization.\n\nRequires the Secretary to establish an advisory council within NIH to be known as the Scientific Management Review Board to: (1) provide advice not less than once every seven years regarding the use of the authority to reorganize NIH; (2) determine whether and to what extent the organizational authorities should be used; and (3) issue recommendations. Requires that changes recommended by the Board be made, unless the Director objects. Provides for congressional review of any reorganization of NIH, including the addition or elimination of any national research institutes or national centers.\n\n(Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to: (1) be responsible for program coordination across NIH, including conducting priority-setting reviews, to ensure that NIH's research portfolio is balanced and free of unnecessary duplication and takes advantage of collaborative, crosscutting research; (2) assemble accurate data to be used to assess research priorities; (3) ensure that scientifically based strategic planning is implemented in support of research priorities; (4) ensure that NIH resources are sufficiently allocated for research projects identified in strategic plans; (5) identify research that represents important areas of emerging scientific opportunities, rising public health challenges, or knowledge gaps that deserve special emphasis and that would benefit from collaborative research or strategic coordination and planning; (6) have the authority to review and approve the establishment of all centers of excellence; and (7) oversee research training for all of the national research institutes and National Research Service Awards. Allows the Secretary, acting through the Director: (1) to conduct and support certain research training; (2) to reserve funds to provide for research on matters that have not received significant funding relative to other matters, to respond to new issues and scientific emergencies, and to act on research opportunities of high priority; and (3) to collect and retain registration fees obtained from third parties to defray expenses for scientific, educational, and research-related conferences, subject to appropriations Acts.\n\nRequires the Director to establish the Council of Councils to provide advice on Division matters.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from approving or funding an approval of a research proposal that is subject to technical and scientific peer review unless a majority of the voting members of the appropriate advisory council or the Council of Councils have recommended approval of the proposal.\n\n(Sec. 103) Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2009. (Eliminates specified NIH authorizations of appropriations, including expired appropriations.)\n\nEstablishes the Common Fund for research identified by the Division. Requires the Director to reserve funds for such research.
