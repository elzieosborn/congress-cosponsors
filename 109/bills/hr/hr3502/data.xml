  <summary date="2005-10-14T15:30:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Vaccine Access and Supply Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) negotiate with producers of the influenza vaccine and other periodic-change vaccines to reach an agreement on the number of doses of the vaccine that each producer will manufacturer for the season; (2) purchase 50% of such a manufacturer's doses that are unsold for the season for the average sales price; and (3) establish a program for the distribution of qualified adult vaccine through states for providers to administer to eligible adults without charge to the state, providers, or eligible adults.

Requires each manufacturer or distributor of an approved vaccine to provide the Secretary with the location of vaccine supplies if the Secretary declares there is a shortage of the vaccine that constitutes a public health emergency.

Requires the Secretary to develop: (1) a response to potential vaccine supply shortages; and (2) a program to promote immunizations with federally recommended vaccines among the adult population.

Requires a manufacturer of an approved vaccine to notify the Secretary 12 months prior to discontinuing manufacture of the vaccine, with exceptions.

Requires the Secretary to submit a plan to Congress to facilitate the participation of manufacturers in maintaining a six-month supply of pediatric vaccines.

Amends Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to prohibit a provider from imposing a copayment, cost sharing charge, or similar charge for administering to an eligible individual a vaccine that is included on the recommended vaccine schedule for adults.</summary>
