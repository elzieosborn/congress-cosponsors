Adjusts such ceiling for inflation after 2006.\n\nMakes the sunset provision (i.e., termination date of December 31, 2010) under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 inapplicable to: (1) the elimination of certain limitations on the tax deduction for interest on education loans; and (2) the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses."
