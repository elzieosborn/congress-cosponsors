  <summary date="2005-03-17T19:28:41Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business tax credit for amounts of qualified carbon dioxide captured in the United States from anthropogenic industrial sources (e.g., an ethanol plant, fertilizer plant, or chemical plant) and used as a tertiary injectant in enhanced oil and natural gas recovery. Sets the credit amount at 75 cents (adjusted for inflation) per 1,000 standard cubic feet of the carbon dioxide captured.

Defines "qualified carbon dioxide" as carbon dioxide captured from an anthropogenic source that: (1) would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as industrial emission of greenhouse gas; (2) is measurable at the source of capture; (3) is compressed, treated, and transported by pipeline; (4) is sold as a tertiary injectant in qualified enhanced oil and natural gas recovery; and (5) is permanently sequestered in geological formations as a result of the oil and natural gas recovery process.</summary>
