The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nSecure Border Initiative Financial Accountability Act of 2006 - Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) determine whether each contract action related to DHS's Secure Border Initiative having a value greater than $20 million complies with cost requirements, performance objectives, program milestones, inclusion of small, minority, and women-owned business, and timelines; (2) submit findings to the Secretary of Homeland Security, including regarding cost overruns, delays in contract execution, lack of rigorous contract management, insufficient financial oversight, bundling that limits the ability of small business to compete, or other high risk business practices; and (3) refer information regarding improper conduct or wrongdoing to the appropriate DHS official for purposes of evaluating whether to suspend or debar a contractor.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report to Congress on the findings and the steps taken or planned to address the problems identified.\n\nAuthorizes additional appropriations to the Office of the Inspector General for FY2007-FY2009 to carry out this Act."
