Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act of 2005 - Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Program to assist eligible educational institutions in acquiring, and augmenting use of, digital and wireless networking technologies to improve the quality and delivery of educational services at such institutions. Defines as eligible institutions: (1) historically Black colleges or universities, (2) a Hispanic-, Alaskan Native-, or Native Hawaiian-serving institution; (3) a tribally controlled college or university; or (4) an institution with a sufficient enrollment of needy students as defined under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Outlines authorized assistance activities. Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology to: (1) establish an advisory council to advise on the best approaches toward maximum Program participation by eligible institutions; and (2) ensure that grant awards are made to all types of eligible institutions.

Provides a matching funds requirement. Limits grant awards to $2.5 million per institution. Requires: (1) each grant recipient to report annually to the Under Secretary on grant uses; (2) the National Academy of Public Administration to conduct periodic assessments (every three years) of the grant program; and (3) the Under Secretary to transmit such assessments to Congress, along with plans to implement any recommendations of the Academy.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2010.</summary>
