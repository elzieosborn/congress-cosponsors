Defines \"qualified homeowner downpayment assistance\" as a gift of cash for the purpose of providing any downpayment for the purchase of a principal residence for a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $110,000. Limits the amount of such gift to the lesser of $60,000 or 20 percent of the value of the residence.\n\nDenies an income tax deduction to a donor of homeowner downpayment assistance who receives a direct financial benefit in connection with the purchase of a principal residence for which downpayment assistance was provided."
