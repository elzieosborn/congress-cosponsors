  <summary date="2005-10-14T19:28:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Rapid Pathogen Identification to Delivery of Cures Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report setting forth a strategy to reduce the time frame from pathogen identification to the development and emergency approval for human use of a reasonably safe and effective priority countermeasure against a novel or unknown pathogen or toxin. Requires the report to include: (1) technical impediments to reducing this time frame; (2) research, development, and technology needs to address these impediments; and (3) potential liability concerns stemming from distribution of rapidly-developed priority countermeasures.

Allows the Secretary to contract with any firm or institution to conduct necessary research and analysis for this report.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a system to rapidly: (1) establish clinical research programs to examine the safety and efficacy of treatments for novel, unknown, or bioengineered pathogens or toxins; and (2) disseminate results and recommendations to clinicians. Authorizes establishment of a fund to support such clinical research.

Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish an interagency working group to carry out this Act.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of HHS to conduct research to rapidly identify, develop, produce, and approve for human use priority countermeasures.

Requires the Secretaries of Defense and HHS to carry out research, development, and procurement to provide the federal government with the capability to rapidly identify, develop, produce, and approve for human use under emergency conditions priority countermeasures against a novel, unknown, or engineered pathogen or toxin for which no existing countermeasure has been determined to be safe or efficacious.</summary>
