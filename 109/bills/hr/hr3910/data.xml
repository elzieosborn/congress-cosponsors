  <summary date="2007-02-15T22:28:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Verifying the Outcome of Tomorrow's Elections Act of 2005 - Amends the Help Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit the appropriate state or local election official from providing a ballot for an election for federal office to an individual who desires to vote in person, unless the individual presents to the official a current, valid, state-issued photo identification. Imposes similar requirements with respect to individuals voting by mail.

Requires each state to conduct regular tests of the equipment used to tabulate votes in voting systems to ensure that a system meets specified error rate standards, and that the equipment works correctly.

Prohibits a state from permitting any individual to tabulate votes cast on a voting system, or to certify the tabulation of votes, unless that individual has satisfactorily undergone a criminal history background check using the national criminal history background check system and the state criminal history repositories of all states in which the individual has resided.

Requires a state to permit a representative of each political party with a candidate on the ballot used at a precinct during an election to observe the tabulation of the votes cast on the voting system, and the certification of such tabulation.

Makes it unlawful for any person to pay any other person for distributing voter registration applications in federal elections, or for collecting completed or partially completed applications, if the amount of the payment is determined on the basis of the number of applications distributed or collected.

Requires production of a permanent, individually verifiable paper record of each vote cast.

Requires voluntary voting system guidelines to ensure the security of any data transmitted or received electronically by voting systems.</summary>
