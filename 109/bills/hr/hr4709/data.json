The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nTelephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit the obtaining, in interstate or foreign commerce, of confidential phone records information from a telecommunications carrier or IP-enabled voice service provider (covered entity) by: (1) making false or fraudulent statements to an employee of a covered entity or to a customer of a covered entity; (2) providing false or fraudulent documents to a covered entity; or (3) accessing customer accounts of a covered entity through the Internet or by fraudulent computer-related activities without prior authorization. Imposes a fine and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years.\n\nProhibits the unauthorized sale or transfer, in interstate or foreign commerce, of confidential phone records information by any person or the purchase or receipt of such information with knowledge that it was fraudulently obtained or obtained without prior authorization. Imposes a fine and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years. Exempts covered entities from such restrictions to the extent authorized by the Communications Act of 1934 (e.g., for billing, protection of property rights, or for emergency purposes).\n\nDoubles fines and imposes an additional five-year prison term for violations occurring in a 12-month period involving more than $100,000 or more than 50 customers of a covered entity. Imposes an additional five-year prison term for violations involving the use of confidential phone records information to commit crimes of violence, crimes of domestic violence, and crimes against law enforcement officials and the administration of justice.\n\nGrants extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes defined by this Act.\n\nExempts lawfully authorized federal or state investigative, protective, or intelligence activities from the prohibitions of this Act.\n\nDirects the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend, if appropriate, federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements for crimes defined by this Act."
