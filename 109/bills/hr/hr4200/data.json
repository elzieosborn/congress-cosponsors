Subjects the research protocols developed and any subsequent modification of such protocols to peer review. Requires submission of the research protocols to Congress.\n\nAllows the Secretary concerned, in accordance with the research protocols, to conduct one or more research projects in an area of land damaged by a catastrophic event. Permits the development of: (1) a proposed research project as part of a catastrophic event recovery proposal; or (2) a research project independently of the recovery proposal during the catastrophic event recovery in response to changing conditions in the area damaged by the catastrophic event.\n\nRequires public access to research protocols and project results.\n\nRequires the Secretary concerned, in developing and using the research protocols, to enter into cooperative agreements with institutions of higher education to form forest health partnerships to utilize such institutions' abilities to address the catastrophic event recovery of forested land. Permits a forest health partnership to be aligned with the current network of Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units.\n\n(Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary concerned in response to a catastrophic event affecting 1,000 acres or more of federal land, and permits the Secretary concerned in response to a catastrophic event affecting than 250 acres of federal land but less than 1,000 acres, to conduct a catastrophic event recovery evaluation (recovery evaluation) of the damaged federal land.

Enumerates the elements that shall be prepared in the conduct of a recovery evaluation for an area of federal land damaged by a catastrophic event, including a recovery proposal.\n\nRequires determinations of whether or not: (1) any pre-approved management practices that should be immediately implemented; and (2) any recovery or research project contained in the recovery proposal should be developed and carried out using the emergency procedures authorized by section 105 of this Act. Instructs the Secretary concerned to consult with the Council on Environmental Quality, but states that the determination remains in the sole discretion of the Secretary.\n\nRequires the Secretary concerned, in order to conduct the recovery evaluation of an area of federal land damaged by a catastrophic event, to use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that ensures the integrated use of appropriate natural and social sciences.\n\nPermits the combination of the preparation of a recovery evaluation of federal land with the preparation of a landscape assessment for nonfederal land in the vicinity of the damaged federal land prepared pursuant to subtitle B of title II of this Act or the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978.\n\nInstructs the Secretary concerned, during preparation of a recovery evaluation for an area of federal land damaged by a catastrophic event involving wildfire, to consider post-fire management recommendations contained in any community wildfire protection plan addressing the damaged federal land.\n\nRequires public notice of: (1) recovery evaluations (including recovery proposals); and (2) public meetings conducted in connection with recovery evaluations and the availability of preliminary analyses or documents prepared as part of each recovery evaluation.\n\n (Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary concerned to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and applicable laws and regulations in designing and conducting recovery projects and research projects. Deems specified activities concerning the preparation and use of pre-approved management practices required by this Act and the use of emergency procedures provided under this Act to satisfy certain requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations.\n\n(Sec. 104) Directs such Secretary concerned to prepare, using required notice and comment rules, a list of pre-approved management practices, by forest type or plant association group, that may be immediately implemented as part of recovery projects or research projects.
