States that such authority shall last for six months after enactment of this Act.

Authorizes additional appropriations for such assistance.

Authorizes the Secretary, during the six-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to assist low-income families and persons under the rural housing voucher program if: (1) such family or person resided, on August 25, 2005, in any area designated as a disaster or emergency area in connection with Hurricane Katrina, or resided, on September 24, 2005, in any area designated as a disaster or emergency area in connection with Hurricane Rita; and (2) the residence of such family or person became uninhabitable or inaccessible as result of such a disaster or emergency.

Eliminates the rural housing voucher program fiscal year unit limit.
