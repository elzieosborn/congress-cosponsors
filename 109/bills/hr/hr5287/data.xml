  <summary date="2006-06-19T21:02:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Hunting Heritage Protection Act - Requires that federal public lands be open to access and use for recreational hunting except: (1) as limited by the federal agency with responsibility for such lands for national security or public safety reasons, or for reasons authorized in applicable federal statutes as reasons for closure; and (2) as such hunting is limited by the state in which such lands are located.

Directs the head of each federal agency with authority to manage a natural resource or public land on which such a resource depends to exercise that authority in a manner so as to support, promote, and enhance recreational hunting opportunities.

Declares that federal land management decisions and actions should result in no net loss of land area available for hunting opportunities on federal public lands.

Requires the heads of federal agencies with authority to manage federal public lands on which recreational hunting occurs to report annually to specified congressional committees on areas administered that have been closed during the previous year to recreational hunting and reasons for such closures and on areas that were open to such hunting to compensate for closed areas.

Prohibits a withdrawal, change of classification, or change of management status that effectively closes 5,000 or more acres of federal public land for use for recreational hunting from occurring unless the head of the federal agency with authority to manage the land has submitted written notice of the action to Congress.

Grants states the right to file civil actions in district courts in cases where federal agencies fail to comply with state authority to manage or regulate fish and wildlife.</summary>
