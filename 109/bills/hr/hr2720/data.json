The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nSalt Cedar and Russian Olive Control Demonstration Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary), acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation and the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, to carry out a salt cedar (Tamarix spp) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) assessment and demonstration program to: (1) assess the extent of the infestation by salt cedar and Russian olive trees in the western United States; (2) demonstrate strategic solutions for the long-term management of such trees and the reestablishment of native vegetation; and (3) assess economic means to dispose of biomass created as a result of removal of those trees. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into a memorandum of understanding for the administration of such program.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) complete an assessment of the extent of the infestation; (2) identify long-term management and funding strategies that could be implemented by land managers in addressing the infestation and that should be tested as components of specified demonstration projects; and (3) establish a program that selects and funds at least five projects to demonstrate and evaluate the most effective methods of controlling salt cedar and Russian olive trees. Directs the Secretary to complete an analysis of economic means to use or dispose of biomass created by salt cedar and Russian olive tree removal.\n\nLimits the costs of the assessment, identification and documentation of strategies (and the provision of grants), demonstration projects, and analysis. Requires the assessment, identification and documentation of strategies, and demonstration projects to be carried out on federal land and the analysis to be carried out at full federal expense. Limits the federal share of the costs of demonstration projects not carried out on federal land and allows in kind contributions.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) review the assessment, identification and documentation of strategies, demonstration projects, and analysis; (2) report to Congress annually, including a synopsis of any independent review and details of the manner and purposes for which funds are expended; and (3) facilitate public access to all information that results from carrying out this Act.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations."
