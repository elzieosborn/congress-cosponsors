    "text": "Worker Reemployment Accounts Act of 2005 - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to authorize the Secretary of Labor to establish and implement a national demonstration project on personal reemployment accounts (PRAs).\n\nDirects the Secretary to make competitive project grants to States or local boards or consortia to provide PRAs to eligible individuals.\n\nMakes eligible for a PRA, in a designated State or local area, individuals who: (1) are identified as likely to exhaust unemployment compensation and in need of job search assistance to make a successful transition to new employment (or if their unemployment can be attributed in substantial part to unfair competition from Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated); (2) are receiving regular unemployment compensation under any Federal or State unemployment compensation program administered by the State; and (3) are eligible for at least 20 weeks of regular unemployment compensation.\n\nAllows PRAs to be used to purchase intensive services, training services, or supportive services through the one-stop delivery system on a fee-for-service basis, or through other providers, consistent with specified safeguards. Provides for cash reemployment bonuses, consisting of the balance of their PRAs, to recipients who obtain full-time employment before the end of the 13th week of unemployment for which compensation is paid."
