(Thus requires each loan to be insured individually instead of as part of a bundle of such loans.)\n\nIncreases loan limits, requiring annual indexing.\n\nSets forth borrower premium charges, including an up-front premium of up to 2.25% and an annual premium of up to 1%.\n\nRevises requirements for the handling and disposal of any real or personal conveyed to or acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the pursuit of all claims against mortgagors assigned to the Secretary by mortgagees.\n\nDirects the Secretary of HUD to establish underwriting criteria that will ensure the manufactured housing program's financial soundness."
