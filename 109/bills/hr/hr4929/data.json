    "text": "Foreign Investment National Security Review Act of 2006 - Amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to revise provisions concerning presidential authority to review pending or proposed mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers (transactions) which could result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States. Directs the President, after receiving written notification of a transaction, and acting through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to conduct an investigation to determine the effects, if any, of the transaction on U.S. national security. Requires investigations to be completed within 75 days.\n\nReestablishes CFIUS as a multi-agency committee (currently, a committee within the Department of the Treasury).\n\nProhibits a transaction unless the President finds that it will not threaten to impair U.S. national security. Provides for enforcement of presidential findings. Prohibits judicial review of such determinations. Outlines factors to be considered during an investigation, including domestic production and national defense requirements.\n\nRequires the President, after a determination to approve or disapprove a transaction, to immediately notify (by written report) both Houses of Congress. Allows Congress 30 days after notification of an approved transaction to pass a joint resolution disapproving the transaction.\n\nDirects the President and designated agencies to submit biennial reports to Congress on: (1) evidence of coordinated strategies by one or more countries to acquire U.S. companies involved in research, development, or production of critical technologies for which the United States is a leading producer; and (2) U.S. critical infrastructure owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, foreign corporation, or foreign government."
