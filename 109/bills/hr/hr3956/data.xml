  <summary date="2005-12-01T20:42:18Z" status="Introduced in House">Savings for the Uninsured on Rx Expenses (SURE) Act of 2005 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a prescription drug discount card program modeled on the Medicare drug discount card program to provide access to prescription drug discounts for eligible individuals.

Defines as "eligible" an individual who: (1) is a U.S. citizen, national, or alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence; (2) is not eligible for outpatient prescription drug coverage; and (3) is not eligible to enroll for prescription drug coverage under part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act.

Applies the Medicare drug discount card program requirements related to enrollment and card features, with certain exceptions.

Requires a prescription drug card sponsor to disseminate information concerning the use of health savings accounts to cover the costs of prescriptions drugs for which discounts are provided. Directs the Secretary to require that sponsors demonstrate that they have a marketing plan to effectively reach out to eligible individuals.

Disallows judicial review of a determination not to endorse a prescription drug discount card program or not to enter into a contract with a sponsor.</summary>
