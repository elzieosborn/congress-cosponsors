  <summary date="2005-07-08T20:48:07Z" status="Introduced in House">Consumers' Access to Health Information Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a food to be misbranded if the label of the food characterizes the curative, mitigation, treatment, or prevention effect of any nutrient on any disease or health-related condition unless the claim is made in accordance with specified regulations. (Currently, a label that characterizes the relationship of any nutrient to a disease or health-related condition is deemed to be misbranded.)

Provides that a claim or a truthful and not misleading statement on the label or in the labeling of a food or dietary supplement shall not cause the food or dietary supplement to be a drug.</summary>
