Allows the measure to contain rescissions of budget authority or reductions of direct spending, or reduce amounts for that emergency.\n\nProvides for expedited judicial review of this Act.\n\nRequires the President to submit legislation for the periodic review, reauthorization, and sunset of tax expenditures with his FY2008 budget.\n\n\n\nMakes it out of order in the House to consider any measure containing a tax expenditure unless it terminates the tax expenditure within 10 years."
