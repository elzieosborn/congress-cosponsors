  <summary date="2005-03-24T13:24:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Human Cloning Research Prohibition Act - Prohibits Federal funds from being obligated or expended to conduct or support any research that includes the use of human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to produce an oocyte that is undergoing cell division toward development of a fetus. Defines "somatic cell" to mean a cell of an embryo, fetus, child, or adult which is not and will not become a sperm or egg cell.

Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council for a review of the implementation of this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall restrict other areas of scientific research not specifically prohibited by this Act, including work that involves: (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning technologies to clone molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryo cells, or tissues; or (2) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals other than humans. Expresses the sense of Congress that other countries should establish substantially equivalent prohibitions.</summary>
