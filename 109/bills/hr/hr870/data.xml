  <summary date="2005-04-15T18:52:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Accountability Act of 2005 or the PhRMA Act of 2005 - Sets forth penalties for violations of acts prohibited under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by an individual employed as the chief executive officer or as a member of the senior executive management group of the manufacturer of a drug, where the violation involves knowing concealment of evidence of a serious adverse drug experience.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require the chief executive officer of the manufacturer of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug to annually: (1) attest that the manufacturer has disclosed to the Secretary all evidence of any serious adverse drug experience related to the drug; and (2) describe the process by which the manufacturer ensures that such disclosure has occurred. Allows the Secretary to withdraw an approval for such a drug for failure to provide such an attestation. Prohibits a chief executive officer of a manufacturer of such a drug from failing to provide such an attestation.

Requires the Secretary to direct a manufacturer or sponsor of a drug to complete any required postmarketing study of that drug by a specified deadline. Allows the Secretary to extend such a deadline. Sets forth penalties for failing to meet such a deadline.</summary>
