    "text": "Veterans Small Business and Memorial Affairs Act of 2006 - Title I: Small Business - (Sec. 101) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a goal for each year for participation in Department of Veterans Affairs (Department) contracts and subcontracts by small businesses owned and controlled by veterans and veterans with service-connected disabilities. Requires the performance review of each senior Department official and Assistant Secretary with procurement authority to include an assessment of that official's performance in meeting such goals. Allows: (1) the use of noncompetitive procedures (a preference) within the Department in entering into contracts with such small businesses for an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act); (2) Department contracting officers to award sole source contracts to such businesses for contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold but below $5 million; and (3) the use of restricted competition to such small businesses if two or more such businesses will submit offers and the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. Directs the Secretary, for purposes of this section, to maintain a database of small businesses owned and controlled by veterans and the veteran owners of such businesses. Bars any small business that misrepresents itself as a small business owned and controlled by veterans from Department contracts for a five-year period. Continues to treat a business as veteran owned and controlled, for a conditional temporary period, after the death of the veteran causes the business to be less than 51 percent veteran-owned and controlled. Allows for the completion of the contract term in the case of a termination of veteran management or control over a small business. Requires: (1) quarterly reports from the Secretary to Congress on small business contracting; (2) a study by the Comptroller General (CG) on efforts made by the Secretary to meet such contracting goals; and (3) interim and final reports from the CG to Congress on study results.\n\n(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary, in procuring goods and services pursuant to a contracting preference, to give priority to small businesses owned and controlled by veterans, if such business also meets the requirements of that contracting preference.\n\nTitle II: Memorial Affairs - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to tribal organizations for establishing, expanding, or improving veterans' cemeteries on trust land owned by, or held in trust for, such organizations.\n\n(Sec. 202) Makes permanent (currently terminates on December 31, 2006) the authority of the Secretary to place markers on the graves of veterans buried in national cemeteries. Repeals a related reporting requirement.\n\nAmends the Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 to provide the government marker benefit to veterans dying on or after November 1, 1990 (currently September 11, 2001). Authorizes the provision of headstones (currently, only markers).
