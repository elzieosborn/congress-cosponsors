    "text": "Arts Education Advancement Act of 2005 - Amends the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 to require, when appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) exceed a certain level, that all of the excess funds be used for the arts education program. (Current law requires the use of only half such excess NEA funds for arts education, and allows the NEA to use a greater amount for other purposes before such set-aside for arts education is triggered.) Requires half the funds for the arts education program in any fiscal year to be used in formal systems of elementary and secondary education."
