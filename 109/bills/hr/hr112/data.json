Directs the President to provide for the appropriate classification of such videotapes. Requires such videotapes to be made available, under seal if appropriate, to both the prosecution and defense if material to any military or civilian criminal proceeding.\n\nRequires the President to take necessary actions to ensure immediate and unfettered access to detainees or prisoners in the custody or effective control of the U.S. Armed Forces by the following organizations: (1) International Federation of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent; (2) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and (3) United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture.\n\nDirects the Judge Advocate General to develop guidelines to ensure that the videotaping required by this Act is sufficiently expansive to prevent any abuse of detainees and prisoners and violations of specified laws and treaties."
