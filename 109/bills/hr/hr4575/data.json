Declares that such market value is the fair market value of a charter flight. Requires public disclosure of such flights.\n\nRequires increased disclosure of travel by Members of Congress.\n\nRequires the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and the Select Committee on Ethics to develop and revise guidelines on reasonable expenses or expenditures for official government travel.\n\nDeclares that a gift to a covered executive branch official, or to an officer, employee, or Member of the House or of the Senate, of a ticket to a sporting or entertainment event shall be the face value of the ticket; and if there is no face value, then the highest cost of a ticket with a face value for the event.\n\nCalls for reviews and semiannual reports by the Comptroller General on activities carried out by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate under the Act."
