    "text": "Protecting Our Children from Violence Act of 2005 - Directs the Attorney General, upon request of the chief executive of a State, to ensure that a covered State social services officer has the authority for online access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) databases and the Interstate Identification Index to carry out criminal history records checks. Limits such authority to a check of an individual who: (1) resided with a minor at the time of an actual or alleged incident of abuse or neglect of that minor, or at the time during which such an incident may have occurred; or (2) is the subject of an investigation relating to an incident of abuse or neglect of a minor.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to ensure that such an officer has the authority for \"read only\" electronic access to the NCIC databases for the purpose of carrying out checks of records relating to missing persons or warrants. Directs such officer to use access only for an investigation relating to a missing child and to share any information obtained with appropriate Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to ensure that the Case Analysis Division, the Missing Children's Division, and the Exploited Child Unit of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children each have access to the Index, subject to specified limitations.\n\nLimits the release of information. Sets criminal penalties for knowingly releasing information in violation of this Act."
