Requires that the views of States be given substantial weight.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to issue orders assessing civil penalties, requiring compliance, or both, or to commence civil actions in U.S. district court to address violations of this Act. Limits civil penalties assessed pursuant to an administrative order to $25,000 per day of noncompliance. Authorizes persons subject to administrative orders to request a public hearing.\n\nAuthorizes States to enact laws imposing limitations (including prohibitions) on the receipt and disposal of foreign municipal solid waste. States that no such action shall be considered to impose an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce."
