    "text": "Education for Public Service Act of 2005 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise certain student loan income contingent repayment plan requirements with respect to public service employees and married borrowers.\n\nProvides public service employees with a shortened maximum student loan repayment period before receiving debt forgiveness under an income contingent repayment plan. Prohibits the Secretary of Education from prescribing such a repayment period exceeding 15 years (instead of the usual 25 years) in the case of those borrowers who, after electing such a plan, have been full-time public service employees for at least eight years, whether or not continuously.\n\nRevises income contingent student loan repayment schedules for married borrowers to attribute to the borrower one-half (rather than all) of the combined adjusted gross income of the borrower and the borrower's spouse."
