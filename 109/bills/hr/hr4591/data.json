    "text": "Stockholm and Rotterdam Toxics Treaty Act of 2006 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to provide for the implementation of three international environmental agreements: (1) the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs Convention); (2) the Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP POPs Protocol); and (3) the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (PIC Convention).\n\n(Sec. 2) Prohibits the manufacture, process, distribution for export, use, or disposal of specified Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue or amend rules related to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in order to comply with the provisions of the POPs Convention or the LRTAP POPs Protocol.\n\nRequires a notice and comment procedure that is triggered by the formal actions of the POPs Review Committee or the LRTAP POPs Protocol's Executive Body to add a new chemical to the international agreements. Sets forth: (1) time frames to publish notices; and (2) the information to be included and requested in notices.\n\nAllows the Administrator to issue regulations to: (1) prohibit the use of such a newly listed chemical to protect human health and the environment in a manner that achieves a reasonable balance of social, environmental, and economic costs and benefits; and (2) bring the United States into compliance with its obligations under the POPs Convention and the LRTAP POPs Protocol when the POPs Convention Conference of the Parties or the parties to the LRTAP POPs Protocol add new chemicals to the list of banned or severely restricted chemicals. Establishes considerations for the Administrator to use when issuing such rules.\n\nSets forth exemptions from the prohibitions and restrictions on specified POPs under the POPs Convention or the LRTAP POPs Protocol. Specifies that if there is a conflict between exemptions under such agreements, the more stringent provision shall apply.\n\nRequires the Administrator to publish: (1) a decision regarding the treatment of any new source categories that are not already listed under the Clean Air Act as major source categories; (2) notice of the development of action plans under the POPs Convention; and (3) a decision on whether to promulgate regulations for newly listed POPs or the status of a rulemaking if the Administrator has not made a decision about such POPs.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the United States shall consent to be bound by amendments to Annexes A, B, or C of the POPs Convention only after such amendments have been ratified by the United States. Requires the President to consult with and report to Congress before consenting to bind the United States to an amendment of the POPs Convention.\n\nRequires the Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretary of State and the heads other federal agencies, to: (1) participate and cooperate in any international effort on chemicals; and (2) participate in activities designed to support implementation of the POPs Convention, the LRTAP POPs Protocol, and the PIC Convention.\n\n(Sec. 3) Prohibits the Administrator from promulgating a rule authorizing PCB manufacture, processing, or distribution activities or granting an exemption from PCB regulations under TSCA, unless they are consistent with the exemptions under the POPs Convention and the LRTAP POPs Protocol.\n\nProhibits the distribution for export equipment that contains more than a specified percentage of PCBs in liquid stock, except for the purpose of legal, environmentally sound waste management.\n\n(Sec. 4) Sets forth provisions concerning judicial review, including applying a substantial evidence standard for review of regulations related to new listing of POPs.\n\n(Sec. 5) Establishes conditions for exporting chemicals listed on Annex III of the PIC Convention."
