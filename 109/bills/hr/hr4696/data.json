Extends such ban to contacts with any officers or employees of either chamber or other congressional legislative office. Applies the prohibition to acts by former personal, committee, and leadership staff who had responsibilities a significant portion of which related to the development of policy.\n\nPlaces a four-year prohibition on lobbying Congress for foreign governments, subject to criminal penalties, for former senior and very senior executive branch personnel, Members of Congress, and legislative officers and employees.\n\nRequires random audits of Members of Congress' annual financial disclosure statements.\n\nAmends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to impose criminal penalties for intentionally misrepresenting facts on financial disclosure statements.\n\nRequires the commission to affirmatively approve all privately funded travel by Members of Congress and staff.\n\nRevokes the federal pension of a Member of Congress or congressional employee if he or she is convicted of any federal offense related to bribery.\n\nAmends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to revise background investigation requirements to require the National Indian Gaming Commission to conduct or cause to be conducted background investigations on the 10 persons or entities with the highest financial interest in each gaming operation it regulates.\n\nRequires Commission background investigations of tribal class II gaming commissioners and their employees.\n\nGrants the Chairman of the Commission authority to approve the 10 persons or entities with such highest financial interest.\n\nDoubles from $8 million to $16 million the aggregate limitation on fees paid annually to the Commission by each gaming operation that conducts a regulated class II or III gaming activity.\n\nAllows an Indian tribe to engage in class II and III gaming activities on lands taken into trust for the tribe after enactment of this Act only if the application requesting that the land be taken into trust stated that the tribe intended to conduct such gaming activities.\n\n\n\nRevises the exceptions to the prohibition on gaming on Indian lands acquired in trust under the Act after October 17, 1988.\n\nPermits an Indian tribe to conduct gaming on lands acquired after October 17, 1988, on only one contiguous parcel of Indian lands located where the tribe has its primary geographic, social, and historical nexus and within the state or states where the tribe is primarily located.\n\nAmends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) treat members of an unincorporated Indian tribe in the same manner as the stockholders of a corporation; and (2) prohibit section 527 organizations from disbursing funds for electioneering communications."
