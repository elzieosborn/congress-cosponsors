  <summary date="2006-10-26T14:36:56Z" status="Reported to House without amendment, Part I">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

District of Columbia Fair and Equal House Voting Rights Act of 2006 - (Sec. 3) Considers the District of Columbia a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives.

Applies to the District in the same manner as it applies to a state the federal law providing for the fifteenth and subsequent decennial censuses and for apportionment of Representatives in Congress. Limits the District to one Member under any reapportionment of Members.

Modifies the formula regarding the number of presidential electors to subject it to the Twenty-Third amendment to the Constitution in the case of the District.

Makes conforming amendments to federal law regarding the Armed Forces (appointments to service academies).

(Sec. 4) Increases membership of the House from 435 to 437 Members beginning with the 110th Congress and each succeeding Congress.

Provides for a reapportionment of Members resulting from such increase.





Prescribes a procedure for identifying the additional Representative to which a state other than the District of Columbia shall be entitled under this Act. Requires election at large of such additional Representative.

Makes conforming amendments to the District of Columbia Elections Code of 1955.

(Sec. 5) Repeals provisions of: (1) the District of Columbia Delegate Act establishing the office of District of Columbia Delegate to the House; and (2) the District of Columbia Statehood Constitution Convention Initiative of 1979 providing for electing a Senator and Representative for the District.</summary>
