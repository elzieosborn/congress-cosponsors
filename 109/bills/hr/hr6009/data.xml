Requires the Secretary to: (1) administer and coordinate the voluntary donation of resources to assist in implementing new programs and augmenting existing national campaigns to provide national strategies for dissemination of information intended to address problem gambling; (2) encourage media outlets throughout the country to provide information aimed at preventing problem gambling; and (3) target radio and television audiences of sporting events and gambling.

Requires the President: (1) to establish and implement a national program of research on problem gambling; (2) to appoint an advisory commission to coordinate the activities of federal agencies relating to such research; (3) to consider the National Gambling Impact Study Commission's recommendations; and (4) acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to develop a Treatment Improvement Protocol for problem gambling.

Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to states, local governments, and nonprofit agencies to provide comprehensive services with respect to treatment and prevention of, and education about, problem gambling issues.
