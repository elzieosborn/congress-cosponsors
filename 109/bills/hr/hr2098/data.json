Directs the Program's coordinating committee to report concerning the scope of, and federal programs concerned with, asthma problems in the United States.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to collaborate with states to expand specified asthma-related activities. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to make grants to nonprofit private entities to carry out related outreach activities. Gives grant priorities to communities disproportionately affected by asthma or underserved by health programs and in which a significant number of low-income individuals reside. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to make matching grants to states to carry out activities to assist children with respect to asthma. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local educational agencies in communities with significant numbers of low-income or underserved individuals for elementary and secondary school asthma-related activities. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) hospitals and managed care plans should undertake certain efforts to increase asthma-related education and training; and (2) federal, state, and local activities should promote Public Health Service asthma diagnosis and management guidelines."
