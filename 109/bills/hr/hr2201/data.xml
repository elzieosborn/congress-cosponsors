  <summary date="2005-06-20T16:42:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Consumer Debt Prevention and Education Act of 2005 - Amends the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 to prohibit a judge, U.S. trustee, or other party in interest from filing a presumption-of-abuse motion if the debtor is a medically distressed debtor.

Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require credit card disclosures under an open end consumer credit plan to include an explanation of: (1) credit scores and the negative effects that low credit scores can have on the consumer; (2) how being over a credit limit hurts the consumer; and (3) how long it would take paying off a credit balance by just making the minimum payments required, and the effect that negative amortization may have in extending such time.</summary>
