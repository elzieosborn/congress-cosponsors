Requires transmittal to the Commission of each final report on a presidential decision to suspend part or all of a trade agreement. Requires the Commission to: (1) review the report and in turn report to Congress on whether or not the suspension authority should be exercised; and (2) review on an ongoing basis and report to Congress on the same issue with respect to every existing free trade agreement.\n\nDirects the President to exercise the suspension authority if approved by a joint resolution of Congress."
