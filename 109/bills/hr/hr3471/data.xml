  <summary date="2005-08-29T22:42:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthening the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program Act - Amends the Social Security Act to revise requirements for the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (Program).

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to distribute to states and localities information on access to federal programs (other than the Program) to help foster youth in transition to self-sufficiency. Requires states to certify that, before or when a child leaves foster care, they will inform the child of the full range of available financial, housing, counseling, employment, and education services, and other appropriate support and services for which the child is eligible.

Directs the Secretary to develop a standard reporting format for states implementing the Program and a uniform process regional offices can use in assessing state progress in meeting needs of youth in foster care and those recently emancipated from such care.

Requires case plans, where appropriate, to describe programs and services that will help the child's transition from foster care to independent living. Revises program evaluation requirements.

Makes eligible for educational and training vouchers youths in or exiting from foster care after attaining 14 years of age.

Directs the Secretary, after issuing a related notice and rule, to implement the plan for the national youth in transition database.</summary>
