  <summary date="2005-03-25T15:40:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Innocent Life Protection Act of 2005 - Requires any State which had sentenced to death a person determined to be innocent by a subsequent judicial process, to suspend the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty for at least ten years.

Prohibits a State from terminating such moratorium until it has, upon application, received a written determination by the Attorney General that: (1) due process of law with respect to capital punishment is observed within that State; (2) the State has established a broadly representative judicial review board that has examined all death penalty cases which are subject to the moratorium and determined they are free of due process violations; (3) during the last ten years of the moratorium there has been no reversal on appeal by a defendant from a capital sentence; (4) the State pursues capital punishment cases without racial bias; and (5) the State meets American Bar Association standards for appointment, performance, and compensation of counsel for indigent persons.</summary>
