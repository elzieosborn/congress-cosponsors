    "text": "Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act - Title I: Insurance and Investment Products - (Sec. 102) Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to make it unlawful: (1) for any registered investment company to issue any periodic payment plan certificate; or (2) for such a company or any of its depositors or underwriters, or any other person, to sell such a certificate. States that existing certificates are not invalidated.\n\nDirects the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) any measures taken by a registered broker or dealer voluntarily to refund payments made by military service members on any periodic payment plan certificate, and the amounts of such refunds; (2) the sales practices of such brokers or dealers on military installations over the past five years and any legislative or regulatory recommendations to improve such practices; and (3) the revenues generated by such brokers or dealers in certificate sales over such period, and what products such brokers or dealers market to replace the revenue generated from those sales which are now prohibited.\n\n(Sec. 103) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require a registered securities association to establish and maintain: (1) a system for collecting and retaining broker/dealer registration information; and (2) a toll-free telephone listing, and a readily accessible process to respond promptly to inquiries regarding registration information on its members and their associated persons, including any such information on any other registered national securities exchange that uses such system for registration of its members.\n\nRequires a registered securities association to adopt rules: (1) governing the process for making such inquiries in consultation with any registered national securities exchange providing such information; and (2) establishing an administrative process for disputing the accuracy of information provided in inquiry responses.\n\nPermits such associations to charge reasonable fees for inquiry responses, except to individual investors.\n\n\n\nShields an association or an exchange reporting information to it from liability for actions taken or omitted in good faith.\n\n(Sec. 104) Amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to authorize the SEC to require an investment adviser to file with the SEC, through any designated entity, any fee, application, report, or notice required to be filed. Directs the SEC to require such entity to establish and maintain a toll\u0096free telephone listing or other readily accessible electronic or other process to receive and promptly respond to inquiries regarding registration, disciplinary, and other information involving investment advisers and associated persons, including whether they are registered with the SEC, or regulated solely by a state.\n\n(Sec. 105) Declares that any state law, regulation, or order regarding the insurance business or the offer and/or sale of securities shall apply to insurance activities conducted on federal land or facilities in the United States and abroad, including military installations, unless it: (1) directly conflicts with any applicable federal law, regulation, or authorized directive; or (2) would not apply if such activity were conducted on state land.\n\n(Sec. 106) Declares the intention of Congress that: (1) the states work collectively with the Secretary of Defense to ensure implementation of appropriate standards to protect members of the Armed Forces from dishonest and predatory insurance sales practices while on a U.S. military installation (including those located outside of the United States); and (2) each state identify its role in promoting such standards in a uniform manner within 12 months after enactment of this Act.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) should study and report to certain congressional committees on state progress in fulfilling that intention.\n\n(Sec. 107) Prohibits an insurer or producer from selling or soliciting, in person, any life insurance product to any member of the Armed Forces on a federal military installation, unless written disclosures have been provided before the sale that: (1) subsidized life insurance may be available from the federal government; (2) the federal government has in no way sanctioned, recommended, or encouraged the sale of the product being offered; (3) are in readily understandable language and in a type font at least as large as the font used for the majority of the policy; and (4) list the address and phone number where consumer complaints are received by the state insurance commissioner for the state in which the insurer or producer has been issued a resident license or the entity is domiciled.\n\nProhibits from further engagement in the insurance business with respect to federal employees on federal land any individual or entity that has intentionally failed to provide these disclosures.\n\nExempts from such prohibition any insurance activities specifically: (1) contracted by or through the federal or any state government; or (2) exempted from this Act by a federal or state law, regulation, or order that specifically refers to it.\n\nDeclares that, if a majority of the states have adopted, in materially identical form, a standard setting forth such required disclosures, after the two-year period beginning on such majority adoption, the standard shall apply with respect to such states in lieu of the requirements of this Act, to the extent that it does not directly conflict with any applicable authorized federal regulation or directive.\n\n(Sec. 108) Expresses the sense of Congress that the NAIC should study and report to certain congressional committees on ways of improving the quality and sale of life insurance products on federal military installations.
