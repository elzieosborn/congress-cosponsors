Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make an annual inflation adjustment to exclusions from such calculation.\n\nInstructs the Secretary to implement a Moving to Work Program in which selected public housing agencies may participate.\n\nAuthorizes funding for tenant-based vouchers.\n\nPermits a public housing agency, at its discretion, to provide a single grant to be used only as a contribution toward the downpayment for the purchase of a dwelling, in lieu of monthly assistance payments."
