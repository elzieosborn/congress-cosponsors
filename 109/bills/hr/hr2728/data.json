    "text": "Health Care Access and Availability Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide for health benefits coverage through individual membership associations (IMAs), which are organizations operated under the direction of an association that: (1) has been in existence for at least five years; (2) was formed for purposes other than obtaining insurance; and (3) does not condition membership on any health status-related factor.\n\nProhibits an IMA from offering health benefits coverage to any member unless the same coverage is offered to all members of the IMA.\n\nProvides that the IMA shall provide health benefits coverage only through contracts with health insurance issuers and shall not assume insurance risk with respect to such coverage. Allows an IMA to provide administrative services for members, including accounting, billings, and enrollment information.\n\nRequires an IMA to file with the Secretary of Health and Human Services information that demonstrates the IMA's compliance with the requirements of this Act.\n\nRequires that health benefits coverage offered through an IMA be: (1) underwritten by a health insurance issuer that is licensed under state law and meets all state standards relating to consumer protection; and (2) approved or otherwise be permitted under state law."
