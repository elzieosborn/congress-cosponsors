Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to: (1) establish a toxic mold insurance program, with priority for one-to-four-family residential properties; and (2) establish in the Treasury a National Toxic Mold Hazard Insurance Fund. Authorizes the Director to assist qualifying insurers to form a federally-assisted toxic mold hazard insurance pool.
