Allows the Administrator to issue interim permits under certain conditions.\n\nRequires the Administrator to: (1) establish performance standards for fine particulates for new and existing mills; and (2) conduct studies of the health effects of increased emissions from the use of tire-derived fuel and report to Congress on such studies."
