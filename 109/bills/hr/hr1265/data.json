    "text": "Abandoned Hardrock Mines Reclamation Funding Act - Requires any person producing hardrock minerals from a mine within an unpatented mining claim or a mine on land that was patented under the general mining laws to pay a reclamation fee to the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n Requires the fee amount to be equal to a percentage of the net proceeds derived from the mine, with the percentage based upon the ratio of the net proceeds to the gross proceeds related to mineral production in accordance with a specified table. Exempts gross proceeds of less than $500,000 from minerals produced in any calendar year from the fee for that year if such proceeds are from mines located in a single patented claim or on two or more contiguous patented claims.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) deposit amounts received into the Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund (established by this Act); and (2) reduce a fee required by this Act by an amount equal to a royalty paid pursuant to an Act of Congress that provides for crediting to the Fund royalties paid to the Secretary regarding hardrock mineral production.\n\nLists permissible uses of the Fund, including: (1) the reclamation and restoration of abandoned surface mined areas; (2) the planting of land adversely affected by past mining to prevent erosion and sedimentation; (3) the prevention, abatement, treatment, and control of water pollution created by abandoned mine drainage; and (4) the control of surface subsidence due to abandoned deep mines."
