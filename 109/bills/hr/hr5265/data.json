Requires the Director to: (1) give priority to areas in which the likelihood of a tsunami striking in the next 50 years is 10% or greater; and (2) award grants to state, territory, local, or tribal emergency management departments on a competitive basis considering financial need, benefit to the community, and a demonstrated ability to cooperate with other emergency services providers.\n\nAuthorizes the use of grant funds to: (1) establish or improve warning systems; (2) purchase public safety agency rescue equipment; (3) reinforce buildings and facilities in maintaining continuity of critical services; (4) provide post-tsunami shelters and supplies; and (5) develop outreach programs to educate residents and tourists about different types of tsunamis and how to react to each type.\n\nSets forth matching fund requirements, based on population. Requires the Director to: (1) determine if grant recipients meet National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) certification standards; and (2) evaluate the effectiveness and tsunami readiness of programs established pursuant to his Act."
