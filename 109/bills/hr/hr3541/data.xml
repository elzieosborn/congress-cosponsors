  <summary date="2005-09-08T19:13:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Promoting Responsible Interrogation Standards Enforcement Act of 2005 or PRISE Act of 2005 - Prohibits subjecting any person in U.S. custody to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, laws, or treaties.

Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) prescribe and submit to specified congressional committees the rules, regulations, or guidelines necessary to ensure compliance by members of the armed forces and by Department of Defense contractors; and (2) report to Congress at least twice each year on the circumstances surrounding any investigation of possible violations of such prohibition.

Prohibits an officer or employee of the United States from: (1) providing assistance to a foreign government for the purpose of obtaining information from an individual held by that government if there is reason to believe that torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment will be utilized to obtain the information; and (2) encouraging or otherwise assisting such a government to transfer, render, expel, return, or extradite an individual to another country if there is reason to believe that the individual would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</summary>
