Amends the State Justice Institute Act of 1984 to allow funds available pursuant to grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts awarded under the Act to be used to: (1) implement and evaluate court-based approaches to adjudicating domestic violence cases in state courts; and (2) provide technical assistance to state courts to facilitate the development and adoption of improved practices in such adjudication."
