    "text": "Gulf Coast Small Business Recovery Act - Requires, for any contract for the procurement of goods or services related to any damage caused as a result of Hurricane Katrina or Rita, or any reconstruction related to such damage, a federal agency to give priority to a business that as of August 28, 2005, had a significant presence in a Gulf hurricane disaster-affected area. Requires an agency to award not less than 30 percent of amounts expended for prime contracts, and not less than 40 percent of amounts expended for subcontracts, on procurements to small businesses that, as of such date, had such a presence. Requires an agency to provide the maximum practicable opportunity for small business participation in all such contracts and subcontracts.\n\nRequires a Gulf hurricane disaster-affected small business to be treated as if it were located in a HUBZone (heavily underutilized business zone) for purposes of favorable loan status under the Small Business Act.\n\nProhibits, until two years after the enactment of this Act, any federal government facility from being permanently relocated from a location in a Gulf hurricane disaster-affected area to a location outside that area."
