Makes safety improvements to America's Byways eligible for federal-aid highway assistance.\n\nRevises provisions that rescind certain unobligated balances of funds apportioned to states prior to September 30, 2009, to include unobligated balances of funds for equity bonus and railway-highway crossings.\n\n(Sec. 2) Increases funding for deployment of magnetic levitation (MAGLEV) projects through FY2009.\n\n(Sec. 3) Changes the item description of a national and regional significance project from improvements to I-80, Monroe County, Pennsylvania, to the redesign and reconstruction of interchanges 298 and 299 of I-80, Monroe County, Pennsylvania, and related improvements to other roads in the vicinity.\n\n(Sec. 4) Makes changes to the item descriptions of specified high priority project authorizations, including certain project authorization increases and decreases.
