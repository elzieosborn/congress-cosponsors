    "text": "Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, with respect to public lands under their respective jurisdictions, to ensure that existing and future authorizations of rights-of-way and easements for electrical transmission and distribution facilities (facilities) on such lands include provisions for utility vegetation management activities that enhance the reliability of the electricity grid and reduce the threat of wildfires to such facilities. Directs such Secretaries to provide owners and operators of such facilities on such lands with the option to develop and submit an integrated vegetation management plan for approval. Outlines a plan review, approval, and implementation process. Allows such owners and operators to conduct vegetation management activities to meet facilities' clearance requirements. Provides a liability waiver when the appropriate Secretary fails to allow such owners and operators to manage vegetation within a right-of-way or easement on such lands, with an exception in the case of contributory negligence.\n\nEncourages such Secretaries to develop a program to train appropriate federal personnel involved in vegetation management decisions relating to such facilities."
