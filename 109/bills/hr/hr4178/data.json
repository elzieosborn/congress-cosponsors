Prohibits such a loan or guarantee if the total amount outstanding and committed to the borrower would exceed $1.5 million (with an exception).\n\nProhibits any such assistance unless there has been a declaration of a disaster in the area or the governor of the state involved has certified that small businesses have suffered economic injury as a result of the price increases.\n\nAllows a small business to use assistance funds to convert to a renewable or alternative energy source."
