    "text": "USA Jobs Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise L-1 (intracompany transfers) nonimmigrant visa provisions. Prohibits the admission of an L-1 worker unless the employer files an application with the Secretary of Labor stating that the employer will: (1) make the L-1 application available for public examination and compilation by the Secretary; (2) provide wage comparability; and (3) not displace U.S. workers during the period of 180 days before and after the L-1 hiring.\n\nRequires an employer, prior to petitioning for admission of a specialized knowledge L-1 worker, to file an application with the Secretary stating that good faith steps have been taken to recruit U.S. workers for the job for which the L-1 worker is sought.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult annually with the Secretary respecting the use and effect of blanket L-1 petitions.\n\nIncreases the L-1 prior employment abroad requirement. Reduces the period of L-1 admission. Establishes an L-1 employer petition fee.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Labor to initiate an L-1 employer investigation.\n\nRevises H-1B (temporary workers) nonimmigrant visa provisions to: (1) subject all H-1B employers (currently H-1B dependent employers) to such provisions; (2) lengthen U.S. worker displacement protection; and (3) authorize the Secretary of Labor to initiate an H-1B employer investigation.\n\nDirects the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate the implementation and impact of amendments made by this Act."
