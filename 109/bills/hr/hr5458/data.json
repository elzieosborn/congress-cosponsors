Conditions a nonprofit organization's eligibility on its expertise and experience in providing the public with informal science and mathematics education.\n\nRequires grantees to enter into agreements with urban high-need local educational agencies on processes for selecting disadvantaged students from schools administered by such agencies for attendance at such camps. Allows the use of grant funds to cover the cost of attendance by such students."
