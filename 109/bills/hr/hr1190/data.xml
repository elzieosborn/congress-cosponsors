  <summary date="2006-04-10T16:30:47Z" status="Passed House amended">San Diego Water Storage and Efficiency Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the City of San Diego and the Sweetwater Authority, to undertake a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a four reservoir intertie system to improve water storage opportunities, water supply reliability, and water yield of the existing non-federal water storage system.

Directs that the feasibility study: (1) document the Secretary's engineering, environmental, and economic investigation of the proposed reservoir and intertie project, taking into consideration the needs of and potential benefits to the area; and (2) indicate whether the proposed project is recommended. Limits the federal cost share and total federal costs.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) consult and cooperate with appropriate state, regional, and local authorities; and (2) submit to Congress a feasibility report and seek specific authority to develop and construct any recommended project. Requires such report to include: (1) good faith letters of intent by the City, the Authority, and its nonfederal partners to indicate that they have committed to share allocated costs; and (2) a schedule identifying the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs that should be allocated to the City and the Authority, as well as the current and expected financial capability to pay operation, maintenance, and replacement costs.

Terminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this Act 10 years after its enactment.</summary>
