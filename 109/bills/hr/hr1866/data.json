Applies the same voting standards to Corporation shareholder approval of such an amendment as apply to a resolution to establish a Settlement Trust. (Thus requires an affirmative vote of shares representing: (1) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting; or (2) an amount of shares greater than a majority present or represented by proxy at the meeting (but not greater than two-thirds of the Corporation's total voting power), if the Corporation establishes such a level by an amendment to its articles of incorporation.)"
