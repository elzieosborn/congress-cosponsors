  <summary date="2005-03-02T21:08:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Temporarily designates Poland as a program country for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act's visa waiver program (VWP), notwithstanding designation requirements of current law.

Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine the nonimmigrant visa overstay rate for Polish nationals for the elapsed period of temporary designation and, based on such calculation, to determine whether Poland shall be designated permanently but conditionally for VWP purposes.

States that, if permanently but conditionally designated, Poland shall remain a VWP country as long as the annual overstay rate remains below three percent. Requires the Secretary to: (1) suspend VWP designation for one year if the overstay rate exceeds three percent; and (2) terminate VWP designation if the overstay rate exceeds three percent for any two fiscal years, with the possibility of redesignation.</summary>
