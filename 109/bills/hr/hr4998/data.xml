  <summary date="2006-05-12T15:10:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Disaster Assistance Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 2006 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to prohibit the termination or demotion of, or other discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment against, an employee who, when activated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a disaster assistance employee reservist, is absent from or late to work. Makes this provision inapplicable if such person is absent for more than 90 days per calendar year.

Allows an employer to: (1) charge against the employee's regular pay any time that an employee loses from employment because of such activation; and (2) request the employee to provide written verification from FEMA of the time and dates of such activation.

Requires any such employee to make a reasonable effort to notify his or her employer of such absences or lateness.

Authorizes a person who has been terminated, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against in violation of this Act to bring a civil action in U.S. district court if the action is commenced within one year after the violation.</summary>
