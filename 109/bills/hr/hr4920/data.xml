Establishes mandatory annual ethics training for Members and House employees.

Amends rule XXV (Limitations on Outside Earned Income and Acceptance of Gifts) to require the Committee's advance authorization of a privately-funded trip by any Member, officer, or employee of the House.



Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) to transfer certain functions of the Clerk of the House to the Committee with respect to filing of lobbyist registrations.

Authorizes the Committee to charge a registration fee.

Requires registered lobbyists to file quarterly instead of semiannual disclosure reports with the Committee in an electronic form.

Requires the Committee to maintain certain lobbying disclosure information in an electronic database, available to the public free of charge over the Internet.

Subjects registered lobbyists, lobbyists employed by an organization registered under the LDA, or the client of such lobbyist or organization to penalties for offering gifts to a Representative in Congress, or any officer or employee of the House, knowing that such gift violates the rules of the House.

Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit former Members, officers, or employees of either chamber of Congress, and any employee of any other legislative office of Congress from making lobbying contacts (within one year after such individuals leave office) with any former Member, officer, or employee of either chamber of Congress, and any former employee of any other legislative office of Congress.</summary>
