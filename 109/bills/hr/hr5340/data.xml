  <summary date="2006-11-03T14:38:14Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 13, 2006. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act - Title I: Sediment and Nutrient Monitoring Network - (Sec. 101) Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the United States Geological Survey (USGS), to establish a nutrient and sediment monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin.

(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish guidelines for related data collection and storage activities; (2) inventory the sediment and monitoring efforts of governmental and nongovernmental entities for the purpose of creating a baseline understanding of overlap, data gaps, and redundancies; and (3) collaborate with other public and private monitoring efforts in establishing the monitoring program. (Sec. 106) Directs the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a water resources assessment of the Basin. Title II: Computer Modeling and Research - (Sec. 201) Requires the Director of USGS to establish: (1) a computer modeling program of nutrient and sediment sources in the Basin; and (2) an Internet-based system to distribute information about nutrient and sediment loss reduction projects and nutrient and sediment levels in the Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries. (Sec. 203) Requires the Director to provide to Congress and make available to the public: (1) an annual report regarding monitoring activities conducted in the Basin; and (2) a progress report, every three years, regarding modeling activities. Title III: Authorization of Appropriations and Related Matters - (Sec. 301) Authorizes appropriations to USGS, with one third made available for its Cooperative Water Program and the remainder for its Hydrologic Networks and Analysis Program, including sums to allow the Council to perform the required assessment. (Sec. 302) Makes funds available for USGS subject to the same cost-sharing requirements as in the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 (which limits the USGS share to 50% of the cost in any topographic mapping or water resources data collection and investigation carried on in cooperation with a state or municipality). (Sec. 303) Terminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this Act 10 years after its enactment.</summary>
