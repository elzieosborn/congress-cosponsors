  <summary date="2007-01-22T20:00:53Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out the following elements of the hurricane and storm damage reduction project, Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, in accordance with the Chief of Engineers' reports of August 23, 2002, and July 22, 2003: (1) the Houma Lock; and (2) the Reach H-3, Reach J-2, Bush Canal floodgate, Point aux Chene floodgate, Reach H-2, Reach J-3, Reach J-1, and Placid Canal.

Directs the Secretary to credit the cost of design and construction work carried out by the non-federal interest before the date of the partnership agreement toward the non-federal share of the cost of such elements upon determining that the work is integral to those elements.

Makes the operation, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of the Houma Navigation Canal lock complex and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway floodgate features that provide for inland waterway transportation a federal responsibility. Requires: (1) the Secretary to maintain the Houma Navigation Canal at dimensions at least equal to those of the lock; and (2) the lock feature to be implemented under an exclusive partnership agreement.</summary>
