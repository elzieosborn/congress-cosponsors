Requires that distribution of such subsequently approved drugs be limited, including by: (1) allowing distribution only directly from manufacturers to pharmacists; (2) requiring pharmacists to register, receive education on side effects, dispense only those prescriptions from physicians at certified treatment centers, and file a statement of compliance; (3) developing educational materials for patients, including monthly questionnaires for patients to monitor the development of adverse side effects; (4) requiring patients to register, receive counseling on the drug, sign a statement providing informed consent for treatment, and undergo appropriate tests; and (5) limiting prescriptions to a 30-day supply with no refills.\n\nSpecifies conditions for a clinic to be certified as a treatment center for a drug containing isotretinoin, including requiring each practitioner to meet certain conditions, such as requirements for registration, an agreement to prescribe in accordance with this Act, and reporting of adverse events.\n\nRequires the Secretary to monitor the distribution of such drugs to determine whether the drug is being distributed in accordance with this Act.\n\nSpecifies conditions under which the Secretary may approve a drug that contains isotretinoin as an active ingredient for a new use.\n\nRequires manufacturers and distributors of isotretinoin to report any information on adverse events associated with the drug to the Secretary.\n\nRequires the Secretary to conduct and support studies to explore the effects of isotretinoin on the central nervous system and behavior, including depression, suicide, and violent behavior."
