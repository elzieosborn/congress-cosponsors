States that, such debriefing must be requested and must be made within 90 days of the award of the concessions contract. Bars the Secretary from being required to disclose any proprietary information of the entity that was selected as submitting the best proposal and awarded such contract.\n\n Permits a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement upon U.S.-owned land within a unit of the National Park Service (NPS) under a concession contract to be pledged as security for NPS contracts using a combination of leasehold surrender interest if holding one or more contracts with the NPS, and prohibits the proceeds resulting from such pledged security from being restricted for use in the park or parks for which the leasehold surrender interest was pledged.\n\nRevises guidelines governing commercial use authorizations."
