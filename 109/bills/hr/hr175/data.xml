Declares that nothing in such title shall be construed as authorizing the exclusion of coverage of skilled nursing services for an individual 75 years of age or older as part of home health services solely on the basis of the individual's refusal of physical therapy services during rehabilitation, regardless of whether such physical therapy services are part of the individual's plan of care.</summary>
