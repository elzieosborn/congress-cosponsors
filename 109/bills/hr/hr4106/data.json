    "text": "Railroad Security and Public Awareness Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and issue detailed guidance for a rail worker security training program to prepare front-line workers for potential threat conditions. Requires railroad carriers to develop a rail worker security training program that meets the Secretary's approval.\n\nDirects the Secretary to develop a national plan for public outreach and awareness of measures that the general public, railroad passengers, and railroad employees can take to increase railroad security.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to make grants to railroads (including intercity, heavy, and light rail), hazardous materials shippers, owners of hazardous materials rail cars, universities, colleges, and research centers, and state and local governments (for railroad facilities and infrastructure) for full or partial reimbursement of: (1) rail worker security training program costs; and (2) security upgrade costs incurred by a railroad to prevent or respond to acts of terrorism, sabotage, or other railroad security threats.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) develop timelines for completing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) framework for analyzing risks to the U.S. rail system and other transportation sectors; (2) evaluate whether the risk assessment used by the Office for Domestic Preparedness should be leveraged to facilitate the completion of such risk assessments; (3) set timelines for completing the memorandum of understanding (MOU) modal agreements for rail, mass transit, and research and development (R&D), which DHS and the Department of Transportation (DOT) have agreed to pursue; (4) develop and issue rail security standards, including a plan for how Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rail inspectors will be used to enforce such standards; and (5) study select foreign rail security practices, including the cost of implementing selected best practices not currently used in the United States."
