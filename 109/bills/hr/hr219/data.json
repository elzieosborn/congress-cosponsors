Prescribes a formula for determining the annual surplus of the Trust Funds.\n\nProhibits disinvestment of Social Security Trust Fund amounts from public debt obligations, any refraining from making such investments, or any delay in making normal deposits in such Trust Funds for public debt limit-related purposes.
