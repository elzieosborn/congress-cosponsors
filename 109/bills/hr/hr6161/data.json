    "text": "Senior Safety and Dignity Act of 2006 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) and title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to include in the nursing home patient's bill of rights the right to receive care from a creditable caregiver.\n\nRequires a skilled nursing facility (SNF), before hiring a worker, to conduct a background check on the applicant. Prohibits the hiring of abusive workers or workers convicted of a relevant crime. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act, including knowing retention of SNF workers who fail background checks.\n\nApplies such requirements and prohibitions to a long-term care facility or provider.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a national criminal background check program, after evaluation of the pilot program under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, in order to prevent abuse of nursing facility and SNF residents and individuals receiving home health care services and other long-term care services under the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct such criminal background checks.\n\nRequires the national criminal background check program to be made available to a long-term care facility or provider.\n\nAdds to the nursing home patient's bill of rights the right to a safe environment during an emergency or natural disaster.\n\nRequires a SNF under Medicare and Medicaid to: (1) have a clear and preestablished disaster plan; and (2) inform residents and next-of-kin about it and the location of possible evacuation in case of an emergency disaster.\n\nApplies the same requirement to other long-term care facilities."
