    "text": "Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 - (Sec. 3) Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) to revise congressional findings under the Act to declare that a number of Regional Fishery Management Councils (Councils) have made progress in integrating ecosystem considerations in fisheries management.\n\nDefines \"confidential information,\" \"regional fishery association,\" \"import,\" \"limited access system,\"and \"observer information.\" Replaces, as specified, the term \"individual fishing quota\" with the term \"limited access privilege\" and defines the latter.\n\n(Sec. 4) Requires a Council or the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) in managing a fishery under an international fishery agreement to take into account traditional participation of U.S. fishermen in the fishery.\n\n(Sec. 5) Declares that allocations of the total allowable level of foreign fishing are discretionary and such allocations shall be zero for fisheries that have adequate or excess domestic harvest capacity.\n\n(Sec. 6) Allows funds or contributions received in support of a marine conservation and management plan in a Pacific Insular Area to be deposited in the Western Pacific Sustainable Fisheries Fund. (Currently, the Fund can only receive payments under a Pacific Insular Area fishery agreement allowing fishing in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around a Pacific Insular Area.) Requires funds collected for violations by foreign vessels occurring within the EEZs off Midway Atoll, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll, Jarvis, Howland, Baker, and Wake Islands to be deposited into the Western Pacific Sustainable Fisheries Fund.\n\n(Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations for the national fishery management program through FY2013.\n\nTitle I: Conservation and Management - (Sec. 101) Revises certain fishery conservation and management national standards used to prepare fishery management plans (FMPs) to require such FMPs be consistent with national standards in which: (1) conservation and management measures take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data based on the best scientific information available; and (2) cumulative economic and social impacts of conservation and management measures be included in any fishery impact assessment made for a FMP.\n\n(Sec. 102) Extends jurisdiction of the Caribbean Fishery Management Council to the U.S. waters surrounding all U.S. territories in the Caribbean Sea. (Currently, jurisdiction is over fisheries seaward of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.)\n\n(Sec. 103) Revises provisions to: (1) authorize the tribal representative on the Pacific Council to appoint an alternate knowledgeable of tribal rights and law and fishery resources during the representative's term; (2) expand the duties of scientific and statistical committees (SSCs) to include peer review of statistical, scientific, and socio-economic information relevant to Council development and the amendment of FMPs, and to provide Councils with ongoing scientific advice for fishery management decisions, including recommendations concerning overfishing and the achievement of rebuilding targets; (3) require SSC appointees to be experts with strong scientific or technical credentials and experience; (4) treat SSC members as affected individuals for purposes of financial disclosure; (5) authorize a peer review process for each Council for scientific information used to advise the Council about the conservation and management of a fishery; (6) direct the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to pay a stipend to members of a SSC or an advisory panel who are not employed by the federal government or a state marine fisheries agency; (7) require Councils to develop annual catch limits for each of its fisheries that may not exceed recommendations of its SSC or the peer review process; (8) require Councils to develop multi-year fisheries-related research priorities for submission to the Secretary and regional science centers of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); (9) eliminate the requirement that notice of Council, SSC, and advisory panel meetings be provided in newspapers in major fishing ports of the region (and in other major fishing ports having a direct interest in the affected fishery) and allow such notice by any means that will result in wide publicity in such ports, except that e-mail notification and website postings alone are not sufficient; (10) require the Secretary to develop a training course in a variety of topics related to fishery management and recreational fishing for Council members and NMFS staff; (11) require newly appointed Council members to complete a training course; (12) authorize the establishment of Council coordination committees; (13) require financial interest disclosures of Council members to be made available on the Internet; and (14) establish guidelines for nomination by state governors of Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council voting members.\n\n(Sec. 104) Amends FMP requirements to: (1) set forth certain additional information to be submitted and considered in the preparation of FMPs, including fish processing and economic and fishery impacts information; (2) allocate harvest restrictions or recovery benefits fairly and equitably among the commercial, recreational, and charter fishing sectors in a fishery, taking into consideration the economic impact of such restrictions or benefits on fishery participants in each of the sectors in the fishery; (3) include in fishery impact statements the effects on safety of human life at sea; and (4) require FMPs to provide a mechanism setting annual catch limits at a level such that overfishing does not occur in the fishery, including accountability measures; and (5) revise time frames for preparation and implementation of measures to end overfishing in, and rebuild, a fishery.\n\n(Sec. 105) Amends discretionary FMP provisions to authorize FMPs to: (1) designate as protected areas deep sea corals that have been identified as essential fish habitats in order to protect them from physical damage from fishing gear or to prevent loss or damage to such fishing gear from the deep sea coral, after considering long-term sustainable uses of fishery resources in such areas; (2) ensure that closures of fisheries to fishing activity are based on the best scientific information available, include criteria to assess the conservation benefit of the closed area, establish a timetable for review of the closure's performance, and are based on an assessment of the benefits and impacts of the closures; (3) incorporate the relevant fishery and take into account the different circumstances affecting fisheries from different states and ports, including distances to fishing grounds and proximity to time and area closures; (4) establish a limited access system for a fishery in order to achieve optimum yield; (5) establish a process for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); and (6) include management measures that consider a variety of ecological factors affecting fishery populations, including the conservation of target and non-target species and habitats.\n\n(Sec. 106) Authorizes a Council to establish with the Secretary's approval (or on its own initiative through a FMP or amendment or in response to a petition of a group of fishermen certified by the Secretary) a limited access privilege program (LAPP) to harvest fish from a fishery that is managed under a limited access system, provided certain requirements are met.
