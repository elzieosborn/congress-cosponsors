  <summary date="2006-03-15T20:49:37Z" status="Introduced in House">Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to offer the 181 Area of the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas leasing no later than one year after enactment of this Act.

Prohibits the Secretary from offering for oil and gas leasing: (1) any area east of the Military Mission Line unless the Secretary of Defense agrees in writing before the area is offered for lease that it can be developed so as not to interfere with military activities; or (2) any area within 100 miles of the coastline of Florida.

Requires the 181 Area to be offered for lease in spite of its omission from a specified leasing program under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</summary>
