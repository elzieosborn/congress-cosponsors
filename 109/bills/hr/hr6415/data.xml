  <summary date="2006-12-19T17:18:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Polonium Act of 2006 - States that accreditation of a representative of a foreign government to the United States under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and accreditation of a representative of a foreign government to the United Nations under the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations shall be deemed to be an express waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction (for the representative) with respect to an act of disbursing radioactive or other substances posing a lasting, clear and present danger to public health. Authorizes the President to waive such provision if in the U.S. national interest.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should propose amendments to such Conventions to ensure that persons who enjoy immunity from criminal jurisdiction (under such Conventions) do not receive such immunity with respect to acts of disbursing radioactive or other substances posing a lasting, clear and present danger to public health.</summary>
