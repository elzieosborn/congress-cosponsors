The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nStates that the ratification and approval of the Jicarilla Apache Nation's deed for specified settlement lands and the issuance of a patent pursuant to this Act shall not take effect until the Secretary of the Interior finds the following events have occurred: (1) the Board of Commissioners of the Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, has enacted a resolution permanently abandoning a specified disputed county road and has submitted a copy of that resolution to the Secretary; and (2) the Jicarilla Apache Nation has executed a quitclaim deed to Rio Arriba County for specified settlement lands subject to the exceptions identified in the Settlement Agreement and has submitted a copy of such deed to the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to publish such findings in the Federal Register.\n\nRatifies and approves the Jicarilla Apache Nation's quitclaim deed for the settlement lands to the County, but such ratification and approval shall be effective only upon satisfaction of all conditions specified above and only as of the date that the Secretary's findings are published in the Federal Register.\n\nRequires the Secretary to issue to the County a patent for the settlement lands. Subjects the patent to all valid existing rights of third parties, including but not limited to easements of record. Requires that the patent include a specified perpetual restrictive covenant running with the Settlement Lands for the benefit of the lands comprising the Jicarilla Apache Reservation adjacent to the Settlement Lands.\n\nProvides that the lands conveyed to the County in such patent shall cease to be a part of the Jicarilla Apache Reservation and the exterior boundary of the Reservation shall be deemed relocated accordingly."
