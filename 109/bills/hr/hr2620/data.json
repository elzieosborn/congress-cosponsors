Provides for reallocation of sums not allocated by reason of this provision to states not so disqualified.\n\nRequires state recipients of funds to collect data for the last year funds were allocated regarding: (1) the racial distribution of charges made during that year; (2) the nature of the criminal law specified in the charges; and (3) the city or law enforcement jurisdiction in which the charge was made."
