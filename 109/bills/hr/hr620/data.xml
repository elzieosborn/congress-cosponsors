  <summary date="2005-03-02T21:00:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Security Measures Feasibility Act - Requires the Comptroller General to conduct a study evaluating: (1) the ability of the States to develop and implement specified security measures (including the incorporation of anti-fraud features, the use of uniform machine-readable technology, and implementation of a social security number confirmation system) for the issuance and use of driver's licenses and identification cards; (2) the cost of developing and implementing each such measure for each State; and (3) the amount of time that such development and implementation would require for each State.

Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of the potential adverse consequences of preventing aliens unlawfully present in the United States from obtaining driver's licenses.

Requires the Comptroller General to report findings of both studies to appropriate congressional committees and to the Secretary of Homeland Security, incorporating any recommendations for administrative or legislative action.</summary>
