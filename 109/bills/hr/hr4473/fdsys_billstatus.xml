Provides that a person shall not be obligated, in connection with a covered futures transaction with another person, to disclose to such other person nonpublic information that may be material to the market price, rate, or level of such commodity or transaction except as necessary to make any statement not materially misleading.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) Directs the agencies represented on the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to work to ensure that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC have taken action to permit: (1) risk-based portfolio margining for security options and security futures products by September 30, 2006; and (2) by June 30, 2006, the trading of futures on certain security indexes by resolving issues related to debt security indexes and foreign security indexes.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations through FY2010.</p> <p><b>Title II: Natural Gas Price Transparency</b> - (Sec. 201) Instructs CFTC to increase transparency of natural gas prices by conducting: (1) surveillance of trading in natural gas contracts; and (2) a review of the factors that caused significant and highly unusual change in the settlement price of any physically delivered natural gas futures contract traded on a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility. Includes among review factors: (1) prices and price relationships in the futures and cash markets; (2) market information and cash market supply and demand factors; (3) large futures and options market positions and transactions on the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility; and (4) related natural gas contracts, agreements, or transactions. </p> <p>(Sec. 202) Directs CFTC to require any person holding, maintaining, or controlling any position in a contract of sale of natural gas for future delivery or option on such a contract, at or exceeding reportable limits, to maintain and provide on CFTC request records for five years regarding the position, including any related contract, agreement, or transaction in natural gas to which the person is a party.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) Increases: (1) the civil penalty for specified commodity market manipulation-related offenses to $1 million, or triple the monetary gain for each such violation; and (2) the criminal penalty for specified commodity trading-related felonies from five to ten years imprisonment.</p>]]></text>
