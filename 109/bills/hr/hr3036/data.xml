  <summary date="2005-07-27T19:05:08Z" status="Introduced in House">No Qualified Teacher Left Behind Act of 2005 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) with respect to teacher qualifications.

Revises the definition of highly qualified teacher, in the case of middle or secondary school teachers who are new to the profession.

Includes consideration of any professional development being pursued, in determining such qualifications for elementary, middle, or secondary school teachers who are not new to the profession.

Provides for rural school districts: (1) an extension of a deadline for having highly qualified teachers; and (2) an authorization of additional appropriations for grants for teacher recruitment, retention, and professional development.

Revises requirements for qualified teachers under ESEA title I part A (I-A) programs for disadvantaged students to: (1) apply only to teachers of core subjects; and (2) eliminate reference to the proportion of inexperienced teachers.

Requires all ESEA grantees, whether under I-A or not, to meet specified qualification deadlines for all teachers of core subjects whom they employ.</summary>
