  <summary date="2005-09-15T19:47:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Gas Stamps Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish a program for the equitable allocation among the states of gas stamps for distribution to individuals eligible to receive food stamps who can demonstrate a need for gasoline; and (2) provide for the distribution of gas stamps in conjunction with the distribution of food stamps, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture.

Sets a $330 million limit for such national distribution in each of the first three months after enactment of this Act.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax upon the sale in the United States of any crude oil, natural gas, and any fuel which is a product of crude oil or natural gas, equal to the windfall profit on such sale.

Defines "windfall profit" as so much of the profit on such sale as exceeds a 15 percent pretax rate of return.

Imposes liability for the windfall profits tax upon the seller.</summary>
