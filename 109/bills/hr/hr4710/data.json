Prohibits GSA from assessing any amount for shell rent, tenant improvements, parking rent, or real estate taxes for federally-owned space assigned to the judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n\nMakes the judiciary responsible for providing funds to the GSA from judiciary appropriations to pay for new repair and alteration, tenant improvement, and construction projects performed by the GSA for such accommodations, except for those projects for which the GSA has separately received appropriations."
