  <summary date="2005-06-21T21:04:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Voter Choice Act of 2005 - Authorizes a state entitled to more than one Representative in Congress to establish a number of districts for election of Representatives that is less than the number of Representatives to which the state is entitled, as long as the Representatives are elected: (1) under a system meeting the constitutional standard of majority rule and of individuals having equal voting power; (2) the system ensures the election of any candidate in a multiseat district who receives a share of votes cast that is at least one vote greater than one-third of the total number of votes cast in the district; and (3) the number of residents per Representative is equal for all Representatives elected in the state.

Requires each state to conduct general elections for federal office held in the state during 2008 and each succeeding year using an instant runoff voting system, and ensure that the voting equipment and technology used to conduct the elections is compatible with such a system.

Establishes a program under which the Election Assistance Commission shall make grants to eligible states to defray the costs of administering an instant runoff voting system or a proportional voting system.</summary>
