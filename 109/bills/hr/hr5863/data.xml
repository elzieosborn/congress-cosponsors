Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to: (1) authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to extend temporary emergency exemptions to requirements concerning polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for 30 days for the purpose of authorizing their safe, effective, and efficient shipment into the United States for disposal, treatment, or storage; and (2) require any person granted such an exemption to report to Congress on the status of foreign-manufactured PCBs generated by or under the control of that person outside of the United States. Requires the report to address: (1) the remaining volume of such foreign-manufactured PCBs that may require shipment into the United States; and (2) the efforts that have been made to reduce such volume.</summary>
