  <summary date="2005-11-15T20:56:01Z" status="Introduced in House">National Ocean Exploration Program Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a coordinated national ocean exploration program that promotes collaboration with existing NOAA programs, including those authorized under this Act. Directs the NOAA Administrator to: (1) conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages or other scientific activities to survey, inventory, observe, and assess little-known areas of the marine environment; (2) give priority to deep ocean regions, focusing on marine systems holding potential for important scientific discoveries; and (3) promote development of improved oceanographic research, communication, navigation, and data collection systems.

Requires NOAA to convene an ocean exploration technology and infrastructure task force to develop and implement a strategy to: (1) facilitate the transfer of new exploration technology to the program; (2) improve the availability of communications infrastructure (including satellite) to the program; (3) develop a data management information processing system for information obtained under the program; and (4) conduct public education and outreach activities that improve the public understanding of ocean science, resources, and processes.

Authorizes NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and other federal agencies to participate in interagency financing in carrying out program activities.

NOAA Undersea Research Program Act of 2005 - Directs the Administrator of NOAA to establish and maintain an undersea research program conducted through a national headquarters, a network of regional undersea research centers, and a national technology institute.</summary>
