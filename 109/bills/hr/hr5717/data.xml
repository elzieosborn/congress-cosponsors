  <summary date="2007-10-09T14:29:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Education Assessment Technical Corrections Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 to except teachers in hard to staff areas from the requirement that all teachers teaching in core academic subjects within a state be highly qualified not later than the end of the 2005-2006 school year. Requires teachers in hard to staff areas, instead, to satisfy at least 80% of the requirements to be highly qualified by the end of the 2006-2007 school year, and satisfy all of them by the end of the following school year.

Revises requirements for assessments of student groups in measuring the adequate yearly progress of the state, and of all public schools and local educational agencies (LEAs) in the state, toward enabling all public elementary school and secondary school students to meet the state's student academic achievement standards.

Provides that a student group which has failed to meet or exceed achievement standards may satisfy assessment requirements if it met such standards in the immediately preceding year.

Authorizes the testing of disabled students at their instructional level, rather than grade level, provided they show progress in accordance with individualized education programs.

Permits states to change the method of counting students who are in more than one group.

Revises the sanctions for schools which fail an assessment by reason of a group of no more than four students from designation as needing improvement to mandatory redirection of funds to the needs of such group.

Requires the Secretary of Education to make recommendations to Congress for increasing the percentage of limited English proficient students and disabled students who meet or exceed state academic achievement standards.</summary>
