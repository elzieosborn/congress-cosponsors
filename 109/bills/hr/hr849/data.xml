  <summary date="2005-06-21T19:48:50Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to convey a specified parcel of Federal land to Clark County, Nevada, for operation of a commercial heliport facility. Prohibits the disposal of such conveyed land by the County.

Establishes a conservation fee for, and restricts the flight path of, helicopter tours originating from or concluding at the conveyed land which fly over the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area. Requires collected fees to be deposited into a special account in the Treasury for use by the Secretary for cultural, wildlife, and wilderness resources management on public lands in Nevada.

Provides that title to the conveyed land shall revert to the United States if the County ceases to use the land for the purpose described in this Act. Makes the County responsible for any reclamation necessary for reversion.

Directs the Secretary to require the County to pay the administrative costs of conveying the land.</summary>
