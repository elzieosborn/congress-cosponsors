  <summary date="2005-12-14T21:15:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Secure Our Nation's Interior Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise expedited removal provisions to: (1) apply such provisions to an alien who has not been physically present in the United States continuously for the one-year (currently, two-year) period immediately prior to the date of determination of inadmissibility; and (2) exempt from such authority an alien who has been charged with a crime, is in criminal proceedings, or is serving a criminal sentence.

States that state or local law enforcement personnel have the inherent authority of a sovereign entity to apprehend, arrest, detain, or transfer to federal custody aliens in the United States (including the transportation of such aliens across state lines to detention centers) in the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.

Directs, upon state or appropriate local request, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) take an illegal alien into federal custody, or request that the relevant state or local law enforcement agency temporarily incarcerate or transport the alien for transfer to federal custody; and (2) designate at least one federal, state, or local prison, or a private contracted prison or detention facility within each state as the central facility for that state to transfer custody of aliens to DHS. Provides for DHS reimbursement of state and local costs incurred in the incarceration and transportation of illegal aliens.

Provides that: (1) aliens (including alien crewmen) seeking admission or readmission to or transit through the United States must be inspected by immigration officers; (2) no alien may be admitted to the United States without having been processed through the automated entry-exit control system; and (3) such system shall verify the identity of every arriving and departing alien by comparing in real time the biometric identifier on such alien's travel or entry document or passport with the arriving or departing alien.</summary>
