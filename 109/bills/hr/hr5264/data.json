Provides related advisory requirements for retail distributors and other vendors. Requires broadcaster public service announcements about the deadline for termination of analog TV broadcasting and the equipment options for consumers following such termination.\n\nDirects the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to create a DTV Transition Federal Advisory Committee to educate the public about the digital television transition. Requires such education to commence by September 1, 2007."
