    "text": "West Valley Remediation Act of 2005 - Expresses the intent of Congress that the federal government should achieve complete remediation of all radioactive, solid, and hazardous waste contamination at the Western New York Nuclear Service Center in West Valley, New York.\n\nStates that this Act: (1) establishes exclusive federal responsibility for the complete remediation of the Center; and (2) replaces and supersedes the West Valley Demonstration Project Act.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy to employ the best current technologies and develop new state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to complete remediation of the Center, including: (1) decontamination and decommissioning; (2) transportation of high level radioactive waste to a federal repository for permanent disposal; and (3) disposal of low level radioactive and transuranic waste.\n\nDirects the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to regulate the remediation of radioactive waste and nuclear materials at the Center according to prescribed guidelines.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: ( 1) consult with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in implementing this Act; (2) prepare any environmental impact statement for decommissioning or long-term stewardship of the Center in cooperation with the NRC and federal and state agencies; (3) assume exclusive use and possession of the entire Center; (4) take title to land or facilities at the Center that have not been approved by the NRC for release for unrestricted use; and (4) take title to radioactive and nonradioactive wastes and materials located at the Center.\n\nRepeals the West Valley Demonstration Project Act upon assumption by the Secretary of exclusive use and possession of the entire Center."
