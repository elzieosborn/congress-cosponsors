Makes each authority responsible for providing the required non-federal amount. Directs the Secretary to credit the appropriate authority with the value of all prior compatible expenditures by non-federal interests made after January 1, 2000.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations. Terminates this Act ten years after the enactment date."
