Requires the Secretary to reserve to the United States a permanent easement to the Wildwood parcel for the location, construction, and public use of the East of Aspen Trail.\n\n(Sec. 6) States that lands acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this Act shall become part of White River National Forest.
