Requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to consider the operating margins, government funding, and quality improvement efforts of skilled nursing facilities in making its payment rate recommendations for such facilities.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow individuals a tax deduction for long-term care insurance premiums; (2) allow long-term care insurance to be offered in cafeteria plans and flexible spending arrangements; and (3) make certain consumer protection provisions applicable to long-term care insurance contracts.\n\nAmends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled) of the Social Security Act to repeal limitations on the eligibility of residents of certain small publicly-operated community residences for supplemental security income benefits."
