 Sets forth the following order of reductions: (1) diversity lottery winners; (2) brothers and sisters of citizens; (3) married sons and married daughters of citizens; (4) unmarried sons and unmarried daughters of permanent resident aliens; (5) unmarried sons and daughters of citizens; (6) skilled workers, professionals, and other specified workers; (7) special immigrants; (8) members of the professions holding advanced degrees or aliens of exceptional ability; (9) priority workers; (10) employment creation aliens; (11) veteran or active duty special immigrants; (12) spouses and children of permanent resident aliens; and (13) aliens not subject to quotas.</summary>
