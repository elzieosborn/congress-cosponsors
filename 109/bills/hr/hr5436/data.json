    "text": "Fostering Our Future Act of 2006 - Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 to require, for grants to the highest state courts for foster care proceedings, that the state in which the courts are located has laws and procedures in effect that will ensure that the courts measure their performance with respect to children under the court's jurisdiction.\n\n Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to forgive the student loan debt of a borrower who: (1) enters a written agreement with the Secretary to remain employed full-time as a family law, dependency, or domestic relations attorney for at least three years; and (2) is not in default on a loan for which the borrower seeks forgiveness. Limits the amount that the Secretary may pay to no more than $6,000 in any year for any borrower or $50,000 in the aggregate for any borrower. Authorizes the Secretary to renew such agreements.\n\n Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a comparative study of state dependency courts and foster care systems.\n\n Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to: (1) court accountability for improved child outcomes; (2) the organization of state dependency courts; (3) building the pool of attorneys qualified to handle cases in dependency courts; and (4) training, caseloads, and compensation of attorneys for children."
