  <summary date="2005-11-22T20:51:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Gulf Coast Hurricane Emergency Environmental Protection Act of 2005 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use Hurricane Katrina disaster relief funding for: (1) cleanup activities: (2) reconstruction and rehabilitation of drinking water supplies and wastewater treatment plants; and (3) addressing threats to human health or the environment due to Hurricane Katrina. Requires the Administrator to prioritize cleanup activities based upon risks posed to human health or the environment.

Directs the Administrator, in coordination with the governors of affected states and relevant governmental agencies, to develop a Comprehensive Environmental Sampling and Toxicity Assessment Plan (CESTAP) to determine health and environmental hazards posed by exposure to contaminants, hazardous materials, or infectious materials released into the environment due to hurricanes and resultant flooding. Requires CESTAP to include comprehensive environmental testing, risk assessment, notification to the public and public health officials of environmental risks, cleanup provisions, training for responders and cleanup workers, and public health assessments and long-term monitoring of health risks from environmental contaminants released by Hurricane Katrina.

Establishes an Independent Advisory and Review Board to assist the Administrator in carrying out this Act.

Habitability of Residential Homes, Schools, and Commercial Buildings Affected by Hurricane Katrina Act of 2005 - Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish a grant program for abatement and inspection activities for residences, commercial buildings, and schools affected by Hurricane Katrina; (2) issues guidelines for mold and mold spore limits in buildings; and (3) issue guidelines for contractor training and certification for mold remediation.</summary>
