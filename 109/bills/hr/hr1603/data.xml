  <summary date="2005-05-17T21:17:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Fairness in Firearm Testing Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to make a video recording of the entire process of its examination and testing of an item for the purpose of determining whether the item is a firearm (and if so, the type of firearm) or ammunition. Bars the Bureau from editing or erasing any such recording.

Directs the Bureau to make available a digital video disc that contains a copy of the recording: (1) at the request of a person who claims an ownership interest in such item; and (2) to a defendant in a criminal proceeding involving such item. Provides that an item which the Bureau has determined is a firearm or ammunition shall not be admissible as evidence unless: (1) the Bureau has complied with such requirement; or (2) such compliance has been waived in writing by the person against whom the item is offered as evidence.</summary>
