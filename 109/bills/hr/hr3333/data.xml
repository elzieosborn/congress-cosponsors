Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) provide for individual taxpayer identification number (TIN) sharing between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); (2) restrict tax credit eligibility for persons using a TIN rather than a social security number; and (3) provide maximum penalties for certain noncomplying employers.

Declares that states and localities have the inherent authority to arrest, detain, or transfer aliens in the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.

Requires Cameron University, Lawton, Oklahoma, to establish an immigration training demonstration project for state, local and tribal law enforcement officers.
