  <summary date="2006-01-04T16:23:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Student Health Assessment Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to provide grants to ten local educational agencies to develop and complete comprehensive health assessments for students. Requires the Secretary to take into consideration school size, socioeconomic status and ethnic composition of students, and location when awarding grants.

Requires each grantee to: (1) notify parents of the availability and benefits of such assessments; (2) assist qualified parents to apply for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP); (3) facilitate or provide such an assessment to each participating student; (4) make available the results of each assessment to the parents of participating children, upon request; and (5) consolidate statistical information, without including individually identifiable information, for the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to develop a checklist for physicians or health care workers authorized by the grantee to conduct such assessments. Requires each assessment to be performed by such an authorized physician or health care provider chosen by the student's parents and to include a physical evaluation and a psycho-social evaluation.</summary>
