  <summary date="2006-07-19T15:38:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Responsible Bioterrorism Funding Act of 2006 - Requires, for FY2007 and subsequent fiscal years, that all grants to states administered by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for preparation for or response to bioterrorism be distributed in accordance with a risk-based formula predicated on a quantitative assessment of threat, vulnerability, and consequences.

Directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) develop such formula, which shall be established and provided to the HHS Secretary by March 31, 2006; and (2) periodically review (and revise as appropriate) the formula to accurately distribute funds based on risk. Makes a revision ineffective for a fiscal year unless it is approved by both Secretaries by July 1 of the preceding year.</summary>
