  <summary date="2006-10-16T19:02:12Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Outpatient Therapy Value-Based Purchasing Act of 2006 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to authorize providers of outpatient physical therapy services and of occupational therapy services to submit to a national therapy outcomes database information on quality and efficiency (Q &amp; E) measures. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish procedures for disclosure of such information to the public.

Directs the Secretary to establish a value-based purchasing program for such services under which service providers will receive higher payments for high quality care, reduced payments for low quality care, or no payments if they have not submitted Q &amp; E information.

Revises requirements for the treatment of such services under the Medicare therapy cap, especially during the period before implementation of the value-based purchasing program.

Requires physical or occupational therapists who furnish Medicare therapy services as an incident to physicians' services meet the licensing requirements of the Secretary.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary shall develop a system under which each covered provider of covered outpatient therapy services participating in the Medicare program has a unique supplier identification number in order to enable the Secretary to monitor the quality and efficiency of such services.</summary>
