    "text": "The Future of Healthcare-- Granting Access to Innovation in America Act (GAIA Act) - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities to carry out demonstration projects aimed at reducing the rate of medication errors and improving the quality of care by installing or upgrading computerized technology that: (1) provides information on drug-allergy contraindications and drug interactions; (2) ensures that all drug orders are legible; and (3) provides physicians and other clinicians with a menu of medications, complete with default doses and a range of potential doses for each medication.\n\nRequires grant applicants to agree to provide for technology including software that assists clinicians who order prescription drugs and tests in making medication-related decisions and that provides for an electronic medication administration record. Authorizes grant expenditures to purchase, install, and update such technology. Sets forth matching requirements.\n\nRequires each applicant to agree to submit to the Secretary, acting through the National Health Information Technology Coordinator, a report detailing: (1) quantitative reductions in medication errors; (2) the level of staff compliance; (3) the difference between administrative and clinical workflows before and after implementation of the technology; (4) alterations and improvements regarding the workflow in facilities that have the technology; (5) an analysis of the improvement of the quality of care and patient satisfaction within the hospital or skilled nursing facility involved; and (6) the overall economic savings associated with usage of the technology."
