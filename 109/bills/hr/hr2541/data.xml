  <summary date="2005-08-08T19:18:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Joe Testaverde Adult Stem Cell Research Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to expand, intensify, and coordinate NIH activities regarding qualifying adult stem cell research. Defines "qualifying adult stem cell" to mean a human stem cell obtained from a human placenta, umbilical cord blood, an organ or tissue of a living or deceased human being who has been born, or an organ or tissue of unborn human offspring who died of natural causes (such as spontaneous abortion).

Requires the Director to award grants and contracts to plan, establish, improve, and provide basic operating support for no less than five centers of excellence regarding such research. Requires each center to conduct basic and clinical research, including investigations into the cause, diagnosis, early detection, prevention, control, and treatment of disease. Allows a center to: (1) make individuals aware of opportunities to participate as subjects in research; and (2) provide referrals for health and other services.

Requires the Director to provide for: (1) a program under which samples of tissues and genetic materials that are of use in qualifying adult stem cell research are donated, collected, preserved, and made available for such research; and (2) means through which the public can obtain information on NIH programs and activities related to such research and through which the Director can receive comments from the public.</summary>
