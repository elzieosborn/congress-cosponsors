    "text": "Routine HIV/AIDS Screening Coverage Act of 2006 - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to require a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage to provide coverage for routine HIV/AIDS screening under terms and conditions no less favorable than for other routine screenings. Prohibits such a plan or issuer from: (1) denying eligibility or continued eligibility to enroll or renew solely to avoid these requirements; (2) denying coverage for such screening because there are no known risk factors present or because the screening is not clinically indicated, medically necessary, or pursuant to a referral, consent, or recommendation by any health care provider; (3) providing monetary payments, rebates, or other benefits to encourage individuals to accept less than the minimum protections available under this Act; (4) penalizing or otherwise reducing or limiting the reimbursement of a provider because such provider provided care to a participant or beneficiary in accordance with this Act; (5) providing incentives to induce the provision of care in a manner inconsistent with this Act; or (6) denying a participant or beneficiary continued eligibility to enroll or renew solely because of the results of an HIV/AIDS test or screening procedure.\n\nApplies such requirements to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market and coverage offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program."
