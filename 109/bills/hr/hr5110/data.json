Provides that project funds: (1) shall not exceed $1 million for any project; (2) shall not be used to pay more than 50% of the project's cost or for facility operation or maintenance; and (3) shall be in addition to other federal assistance.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) review any relevant information developed in connection with research carried out by others; (2) seek the advice of individuals with relevant professional or academic expertise and of companies or individuals with industrial experience; and (3) solicit comments and suggestions from the public. Authorizes appropriations."
