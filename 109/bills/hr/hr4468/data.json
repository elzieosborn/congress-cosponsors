    "text": "Enhancing America's Guard and Reserve Act - Entitles a Federal employee who is a member of a reserve component to receive the difference in pay between military compensation and civilian compensation during periods of active duty exceeding 30 days.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the military department concerned to reimburse States or local governments for 50 percent of the civilian compensation paid by such governments to equalize military and civilian pay. Increases the reimbursement rate to 100 percent if active duty extends beyond nine months.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to establish an active-duty reserve component employee credit for employers who provide compensation to employees on active duty. Modifies age and service requirements for receipt of retired pay for non-regular service. Removes certain service commencement and continuation requirements for the receipt by members of the Selected Reserve of benefits under the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense (DOD) managed care program). Increases the amount of basic educational assistance for members of reserve components under the Montgomery GI Bill. Prohibits the termination of educational assistance for a member's failure to participate satisfactorily in required training due solely to a call to active duty. Authorizes the limited use of telecommuting to satisfy inactive-duty training. Requires the Secretary of Defense to give Selected Reserve members eligibility for travel on DOD aircraft on a space-available basis."
