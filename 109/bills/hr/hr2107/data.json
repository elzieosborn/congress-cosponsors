(Corporation), to carry out the Fund's purposes (generally, maintaining and repairing the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C., and periodically adding to it the names of law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty); and (2) transfer all amounts in the Fund to the Corporation, in accordance with the terms of such agreement.\n\nRevises the purposes of the Fund to repeal: (1) authority to provide educational scholarships to immediate family members of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty whose names appear on the Memorial; and (2) limitation of the Fund's use for its own administration to the lesser of ten percent of its annual income or $200,000 during any one-year period (including an emergency affecting the Memorial's operation)."
