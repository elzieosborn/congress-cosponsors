Allows the Secretary to: (1) exempt any professional sports association that has previously adopted and implemented policies and procedures that meet or exceed the requirements of such regulations; and (2) fine any such association for failure to adopt and enforce testing policies and procedures consistent with the regulations.

Requires the Comptroller General to study the use of performance-enhancing substances by college and secondary school athletes.</summary>
