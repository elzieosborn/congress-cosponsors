    "text": "Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006 - Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to require: (1) quarterly instead of semiannual filing of lobbying disclosures reports; (2) electronic filing; (3) maintenance of certain lobbying disclosure information in an electronic data base, available to the public free of charge over the Internet; (4) disclosure by registered lobbyists of all past executive and congressional employment; (5) disclosure of grassroots lobbying activities by paid lobbyists; (6) disclosure of registered lobbyists contributions and payments; and (7) an increased penalty for failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements.\n\nRevises criteria, with regard to disclosure requirements, for determining a coalition or association of groups that retain a person to conduct lobbying or grassroots lobbying activities.\n\nExtends from one to two years the ban on lobbying contacts by former very senior executive personnel, former Members of Congress, and officers and employees of the legislative branch with any officer or employee of the entity in which such person served before his or her tenure terminated.\n\nAmends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to grant a current or former employee or officer assigned to an Indian tribe to perform services pursuant to self-governance contracts or compacts formerly performed by them for the United States to communicate with and appear before any department, agency, court, or commission on behalf of the Indian tribe with respect to any matter relating to the contract or compact.\n\nRequires public disclosure by Members of Congress of employment negotiations.\n\nExempts from the restrictions on gifts to Members of Congress or Senators, officers, or employees the market value for a flight on an airplane not licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate for compensation or hire. Declares that such market value is the fair market value of a charter flight. Requires public disclosure of such flights.\n\nDeclares that a gift to a covered executive branch official, or to an officer, employee, or Member of the House or of the Senate, of a ticket to a sporting or entertainment event shall be the face value of the ticket; and if there is no face value, then the highest cost of a ticket with a face value for the event.\n\nProhibits a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House from accepting a gift of travel (including any transportation, lodging, and meals during such travel) from any private source.\n\nCalls for reviews and semiannual reports by the Comptroller General on activities carried out by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate under the Act.\n\nMakes it out of order to consider specified appropriations measures if: (1) their accompanying reports or managers' joint explanatory statements contain any earmarks; or (2) a measure contains any earmark but does not name the requesting Member and the pertinent congressional district.\n\nMakes it out of order to consider a conference report until such report and its accompanying joint explanatory statement have been made available three days on the Internet to the general public.\n\nSets forth: (1) prohibitions on the use of federal funds for political advocacy; (2) reporting disclosure requirements for grantees of such funds; (3) reporting requirements of such grantors; and (4) public disclosure requirements regarding the grants."
