  <summary date="2005-08-31T14:46:35Z" status="Introduced in House">Child Abuse Reform and Enforcement Act of 2005 - CARE Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to reduce by 25 percent certain fiscal year allocations and grant amounts, under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and the National Child Protection Act of 1993, respectively, to any state that is not in compliance with requirements of this Act.

Directs the Attorney General to use such withheld amounts and authorized funds under this Act for additional grants to states in compliance to computerize, improve, transmit, and index their own data and criminal history files in the national data and criminal history systems for child sexual abuse protection and sentencing reform.

 Requires a state, to be eligible for funding under this Act, to: (1) study its laws pertaining to intrafamilial and extrafamilial sexual abuse of children, and examine issues concerning their differences; (2) examine disparities in charging and sentencing perpetrators of child sexual abuse; (3) examine, and implement, legislative actions necessary to equalize charging and sentencing without regard to familial relationship of perpetrator to child victim; (4) compile, analyze, and report relevant data; and (5) promote regulations requiring its courts and agencies to compile such data.</summary>
