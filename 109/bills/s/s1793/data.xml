  <summary date="2005-10-19T20:55:29Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends federal aviation law to extend through FY2006 the current authority of the Secretary of Transportation to apportion to the sponsor of a primary airport an amount equal to the amount apportioned to that sponsor in FY2002 or FY2003, whichever amount is greater, if the Secretary finds that: (1) the passenger boardings at the airport were below 10,000 in calendar year 2002 or 2003; (2) the airport had at least 10,000 passenger boardings and scheduled passenger aircraft service in either calendar year 2000 or 2001; and (3) the reason that passenger boardings were below 10,000 was the decrease in passengers following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</summary>
