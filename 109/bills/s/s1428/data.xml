  <summary date="2005-09-30T20:09:27Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Stop Business With Terrorists Act of 2005 - States that, in the case of a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States that is prohibited from engaging in a transaction with a foreign person, such prohibition shall also apply to: (1) each subsidiary or affiliate of the person so prohibited; and (2) any other entity that is controlled in fact by that person. Prohibits such a person from controlling in fact any foreign person who is engaged in such a transaction whether or not the foreign person is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Defines as a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States: (1) a citizen or resident of the United States; (2) a person actually within the United States; (3) a corporation, partnership, or other organization or entity organized under the laws of the United States or any state, territory, or possession thereof; (4) a corporation, partnership, or other organization owned or controlled in fact by a person or entity described in (1) or (3).

Makes the prohibition applicable in any case in which: (1) the President takes action under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or the Trading With the Enemy Act to prohibit a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from engaging in a transaction with a foreign person; or (2) the Secretary of State has determined that the government of a country that has jurisdiction over a foreign person has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. Allows a subject person 90 days to divest or terminate the prohibited business with the foreign person. Requires the President to publish a list of foreign persons under sanction.

Requires the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control to notify Congress if any sanction is imposed by such Office as a result of an investigation.

Expresses the sense of Congress that investors and the public should be informed of activities engaged in by a person that may threaten the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.</summary>
