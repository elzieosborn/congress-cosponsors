Repeals the $500 consumer liability limit for such unauthorized transfers or account errors (thus applying the regular $50 maximum limit currently specified for timely reported unauthorized transfers or account errors).\n\nApplies error resolution requirements to any charge for goods or services not accepted by the consumer (or designee), or not delivered to the consumer (or designee), in accordance with the agreement made at the time of a transaction.\n\nSets forth the rights of consumers with respect to issuers of accepted credit and debit cards."
