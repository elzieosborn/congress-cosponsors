Establishes within the Department of Agriculture the Office of Special Counsel for Competition Matters, which shall be headed by a Special Counsel for Competition Matters. States that the Office shall: (1) investigate and prosecute violations of this Act, the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, and any other Act that the Secretary of Agriculture determines appropriate; (2) serve as a liaison between the Department and the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to competition and trade practices in the food and agricultural sector; and (3) maintain a staff of attorneys and other appropriate professionals.

Requires a dealer, handler, contractor, processor, or commission merchant with annual sales in excess of $100 million to file an annual corporate structure report with the Secretary.

Prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices: (1) in agricultural commerce; (2) concerning producer associations; and (3) in agricultural contracts.

Sets forth agricultural and production contract and enforcement provisions.

Extends: (1) administrative enforcement authority to live poultry dealers; and (2) temporary injunction or restraining order authority to instances of poultry care.

States that: (1) it shall be an unlawful practice to engage in an unfair or discriminatory practice or device regardless of whether the practice or device causes a competitive injury or otherwise adversely effects competition; and (2) a person affected by specified unfair practices shall not be required to prove predatory intent, competitive injury, or likelihood of injury.</summary>
