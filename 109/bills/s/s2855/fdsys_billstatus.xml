        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Community Water Treatment Hazards Reduction Act of 2006 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) compile a list of all high-consequence facilities; and (2) notify each owner and operator of a water facility that is included on the list. Requires the Administrator, in determining whether a facility is a high-consequence water facility, to consider: (1) the number of people located in the vulnerability zone for each substance of concern that could be released at the water facility; (2) the critical infrastructure served by the facility; (3) any use by the facility of large quantities of one or more substances of concern; and (4) the quantity and volume of annual shipments of substances of concern to or from the facility. Defines &quot;vulnerability zone&quot; as a geographic area that would be affected by a worst-case release of certain hazardous substances.</p> <p>Requires the Administrator to classify high-consequence water facilities into three tiers and give priority to matters relating to the security of high-consequence water facilities based on the classification. Makes mandatory the designation as a high-consequence facility of those whose vulnerability zone contains more than 10,000 individuals. Prohibits the Administrator from reclassifying such a facility into a tier with a lower priority.</p> <p>Requires the owner or operator of a high-consequence water facility to submit to the Administrator an options feasibility assessment (including a cost estimate) concerning the use of inherently safer technologies no later than 90 days after receiving notice that such facility is listed.</p> <p>Requires the Administrator, subject to the availability of grant funds, to issue an order requiring a facility to eliminate the use of substances of concern and to adopt safer technologies. Authorizes the Administrator to seek enforcement of an order. </p> <p>Directs the Administrator to provide grants to high-consequence facilities for use in paying capital expenditures directly required to complete the transition of such facility to the use of safer technologies.</p>]]></text>
