        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p> <p>Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2005 or OPEN Government Act of 2005 - (Sec. 3) Amends the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), with respect to document duplication fees, to prohibit a federal agency from denying news media status to a news media representative solely on the absence of institutional associations of the requester and requires consideration of the requester's prior publication history. Requires an agency, if a requester has no prior publication history or current affiliation, to consider the requester's stated intent at the time the request is made to distribute information to a reasonably broad audience.</p> <p>(Sec. 4) Provides that, for purposes of recovery of attorney fees and other litigation costs, a complainant has substantially prevailed if : (1) the complainant has obtained a substantial part of its requested relief through a judicial or administrative order or an enforceable written agreement; or (2) the complainant's pursuit of a nonfrivolous claim or defense has been a catalyst for a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the opposing party that provides a substantial part of the requested relief.</p> <p>(Sec. 5) Directs the Attorney General to: (1) notify the Special Counsel of civil actions taken for arbitrary and capricious rejections of requests for agency records; and (2) annually submit reports on the number of such actions taken. Requires the Special Counsel to annually submit reports to Congress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel regarding civil actions taken for such rejections of requests for agency records.</p> <p>(Sec. 6) Provides for the commencement of the 20-day time limit within which agencies shall determine whether to comply with a request for agency records on the day in which the request is first received. Prohibits agencies from tolling a request without the consent of the party filing the request. </p> <p>Prohibits an agency, if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of the FOIA with respect to a request, from asserting any exemption to that request, unless disclosure: (1) would endanger U.S. national security; (2) would disclose personal private information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 or proprietary information; or (3) is otherwise prohibited by law. Permits a court to waive the application of such amendment if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that there was good cause for the failure to comply with the applicable time limit provisions. Makes such amendment effective one year after enactment of this Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 7) Requires agencies to establish: (1) a system to assign tracking numbers for requests for information; and (2) telephone or Internet service that provides the status of requests.
