        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p> <p>United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act - <b>Title I: Approval of, and General Provisions Relating to, the Agreement</b> - (Sec. 101) Approves the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement entered into on January 19, 2006, with the government of Oman, and the statement of administrative action proposed to implement the Agreement, both submitted to Congress on June 26, 2006.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) Authorizes the President to proclaim actions, and other appropriate officers of the U.S. government to issue regulations, necessary to ensure that any provision of this Act that takes effect on the date the Agreement enters into force is appropriately implemented.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) Authorizes related presidential proclamations only if: (1) the President has obtained advice regarding the proposed action from the appropriate advisory committees and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC); (2) the President has reported to specified congressional committees with respect to such action; (3) a period of 60 days has expired; and (4) the President has consulted with the appropriate congressional committees during such 60-day period. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Authorizes the President to establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office to provide administrative assistance to dispute settlement panels established under the Agreement. Authorizes appropriations.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) Authorizes the United States to resolve any claim against it covered by the Agreement pursuant to the Investor-State Dispute Settlement procedures set forth in the Agreement.</p> <p><b>Title II: Customs Provisions</b> - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the President to proclaim necessary or appropriate modifications or continuation of duty, continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or additional duties to carry out the Agreement.</p> <p>Requires the President to terminate the designation of Oman as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974 on the date the Agreement enters into force.</p> <p>Allows the President to substitute for the base rate an ad valorem rate deemed equivalent to the base rate with respect to any good for which such rate in the Agreement is a specific or compound rate of duty.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) Prescribes rules of origin with respect to the reduction and elimination of duties imposed by the United States and Oman on goods imported directly from Oman or the United States into the other country's territory. Specifies content requirements allowing certain textile and apparel goods to be considered originating goods.</p> <p>Authorizes the President to proclaim, as part of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, certain provisions in the Agreement (including modifications) and any additional subordinate category that is necessary to carry out this title, consistent with the Agreement.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to prohibit the charge of a fee for certain customs services with respect to goods imported from, and originating in, Oman. Prohibits any service exempted from such fees from being funded with money from the Customs User Fee Account.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) Authorizes the President to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, during the period of a verification procedure by the Oman government requested by the Secretary, to determine: (1) the compliance of an exporter or producer in Oman with applicable customs laws, regulations, procedures, requirements, or practices affecting trade in textile or apparel goods; or (2) the accuracy of a claim that a good exported or produced by the exporter or producer qualifies as an originating good, or is a good of Oman.</p> <p>Authorizes the President to require the Secretary to suspend liquidation of the entry of any textile or apparel good: (1) subject to compliance verification if the verification was based on a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity related to the good; or (2) for which an accuracy claim has been made about its origin.</p> <p>Authorizes the President to direct the Secretary, if the information obtained is insufficient for a verification determination, to: (1) publish the name and address of the person that is the subject of the verification; (2) deny preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement to any textile or apparel good exported or produced by such person or that is the subject of a claim for verification of origin; and (3) deny entry of such goods into the United States.</p> <p>(Sec. 205) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize the Customs Service to reliquidate an entry and refund any excess duties (including merchandise processing fees) paid on a good qualifying under the rules of origin for which no claim for preferential treatment was made at the time of importation if the importer takes certain actions within one year after such importation.</p> <p><b>Title III: Relief From Imports - Subtitle A: Relief From Imports Benefiting From the Agreement</b> - (Sec. 311) Authorizes an entity (including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers) to petition the ITC for an adjustment to U.S. obligations under the Agreement. Requires the ITC, upon the filing of a petition, to investigate promptly whether, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for under the Agreement, an Omani article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry producing an article like, or directly competitive with, the imported article. Exempts from such an investigation any Omani articles already subject to import relief under the Agreement.</p> <p>(Sec. 313) Requires the President, after receiving an affirmative injury determination from the ITC, to provide certain three-year import relief to remedy or prevent such injury, and to facilitate efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.
