Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to illegal aliens to: (1) establish criminal penalties and forfeiture for aliens unlawfully present in the United States; and (2) increase specified criminal penalties for illegal entry and failure to depart violations.

Provides for the listing of immigration violators in the National Crime Information Center database.

 Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) construct or acquire 20 additional detention facilities for aliens detained pending removal (or a decision on removal); and (2) request the transfer of military installations under base closure laws for such purposes.

Provides: (1) personal liability immunity to the same extent as corresponding federal immunity for state or local personnel enforcing immigration laws within the scope of their duties; and (2) civil rights money damage immunity for state or local agencies enforcing immigration laws unless their personnel violated criminal law in such enforcement.

States with respect to an alien subject to removal that the Secretary shall ensure such alien's detention in an adequate (as defined by this Act) state or local prison, detention center, or other comparable facility prior to his or her removal examination.

States that the Department shall continue to operate the institutional removal program (IRP), which shall be expanded to all states. Authorizes permanent appropriations for IRP.
