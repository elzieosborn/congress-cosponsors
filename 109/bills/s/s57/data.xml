Permits the use of Federal funds to be expended only on improvements or facilities that are owned in fee by the United States.

Directs the Secretary to cause a survey to be conducted by the Office of Cadastral Survey of the Bureau of Land Management of the boundary lines and the description to be published in the Federal Register.
