  <summary date="2006-06-29T19:49:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Community-Based Choices for Older Americans Act of 2006 - Requires the Assistant Secretary for Aging to provide allotments to enable states whose plans are approved to execute a program that pays for the federal share of costs of covered long-term care service and supplies for individuals who: (1) are 60 years or older; (2) are not eligible for Medicaid assistance; (3) meet state income eligibility and total asset criteria; (4) are unable to perform a certain number of daily living activities (such as eating, bathing, and dressing) without substantial assistance, have a certain level of disability, or require substantial supervision due to cognitive or mental impairment; and (5) satisfy other state eligibility criteria.

Bases state allotments on the number of individuals age 60 or older whose income does not exceed the poverty line residing in a state relative to the total number residing in all states. Stipulates that allotments are to supplement and not to supplant other federal or state payments for long-term care services.

Sets forth: (1) program plan requirements, including descriptions of eligibility criteria, services and supplies to be provided, and methodologies for individual cost-sharing, coordinating with other assistance programs, coordinating service, and outreach; and (2) responsibilities of state service coordinators, including assisting with the development and coordination of individual care plans.

Requires states to establish annual assistance amounts for each enrolled individual and to make payments to individuals in accordance with their care plans. Limits the annual assistance amount per individual.</summary>
