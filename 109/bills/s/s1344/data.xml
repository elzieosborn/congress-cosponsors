  <summary date="2005-08-17T19:24:11Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Community Health Center Volunteer Provider Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to deem volunteer practitioners at health centers as employees of the Public Health Service for purposes of any civil action that may arise due to providing services to patients at such health centers.

Defines "volunteer practitioner" as a licensed physician who: (1) at the request of the entity, provides services to patients of a public or nonprofit entity receiving Federal funds for serving medically underserved areas; (2) provides such service at a site at which the entity operates or at a site designated by the entity; and (3) does not receive any compensation for the provision of services.

Requires the Comptroller General to study the adequacy of funding for liability coverage for: (1) public or nonprofit private entities receiving federal funds for health centers; and (2) volunteer practitioners serving such centers.</summary>
