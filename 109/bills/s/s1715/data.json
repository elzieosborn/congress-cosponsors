Allows affected states to apply for waivers of nonfederal share requirements and use reallocated funds for apprenticeship programs for individuals with disabilities to participate in reconstruction or other major disaster assistance activities in areas where they lived on August 22, 2005. Allows affected states to apply to use certain grant funds under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 to enable HK-affected individuals with disabilities to replace damaged or lost assistive technology devices. Authorizes ED to make grants to enable affected states to carry out such replacement programs.\n\nRequires an audit of each ED program that includes HK-related response and recovery activities.\n\nChild Care Disaster Assistance Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) waive, for HK-disaster areas, specified provisions of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 in order to provide child care services to orphaned children or displaced families; and (2) provide technical assistance and guidance to providers of child care services to such children and families.\n\nDirects HHS to: (1) waive income eligibility and documentation requirements for HK-affected children in programs under the Head Start Act; and (2) provide technical assistance, guidance, and resources for Head Start agencies serving such children."
