Directs the Secretary to establish the Assistance Center for Employers and Employment Assistance Organizations to assist employers, employment assistance organizations, and associations of employers in facilitating such transition.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a 15-year study on the effects of traumatic brain injury incurred by such members; and (2) establish within the Department of Defense the Traumatic Brain Injury Family Caregiver Panel to develop curricula for training family members in the provision of care and assistance to returning members for traumatic brain injuries incurred during such service.</summary>
