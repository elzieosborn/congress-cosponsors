Requires the use of such funds: (1) to assist in purchasing or improving communication systems to allow for real-time, interoperable communication between sate and local first responders and nuclear power plant representatives; or (2) for expenditures to improve the ability of communities to facilitate evacuations and provide medical treatment in the event of an emergency at a nuclear power plant.

Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to promulgate regulations requiring all nuclear power plants to comply with a certain design basis threat level under the Code of Federal Regulations, applicable to facilities designated by the Secretary as Threat Level 1(b) facilities.</summary>
