Permits construction to be commenced only after a non-federal interest has entered into a binding agreement with the Secretary to pay: (1) the non-federal share of construction costs; and (2) 100% of any operation and maintenance costs. Limits to $5 million in federal funds the amount that may be allotted for a project at any single location."
