    "text": "Family Entertainment Protection Act - Prohibits a business from selling, renting, or permitting the sale or rental of any video game with a Mature, Adults-Only, or Ratings Pending rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board to any individual who has not attained the age of 17 years.\n\nSubjects violators of this Act to a civil penalty.\n\nRequires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to contract with an expert, independent organization to determine annually whether Board ratings remain consistent and reliable.\n\nAuthorizes the FTC to conduct: (1) and publicize the results of an annual secret audit of businesses to determine how frequently minors who attempt to purchase video games with a Mature, Adults-Only, or Rating Pending rating are able to do so successfully; and (2) an investigation into embedded content in video games that can be accessed through a keystroke combination, pass-code, or other technological means to estimate certain data about video games with embedded content.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that whenever the FTC determines that the content of a video game is inconsistent with the rating given to such game, it shall take appropriate action under its authority to regulate unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\n\nRequires the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection to ensure that consumers can file complaints alleging misleading or deceptive content-descriptions or labels on a video game using the same procedure (including an easily accessible online filing system) by which complaints are now accepted concerning other forms of unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent advertising."
