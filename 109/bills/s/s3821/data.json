(Currently such provision is limited to athletes performing at an \"internationally recognized level of performance.\")\n\nProhibits visa issuance to an alien from a country that is a state sponsor of international terrorism unless the Secretary of State determines that such alien is not a threat to U.S. security.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to permit: (1) a petition to seek P-1 classification for multiple alien athletes; and (2) athletes or their employers to seek admission for such athletes under other than P-1 provisions of INA if eligible under such other provisions."
