  <summary date="2007-01-04T16:25:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on December 6, 2006. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Creating Opportunities for Minor League Professionals, Entertainers, and Teams through Legal Entry Act of 2006 or the COMPETE Act of 2006 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to enlarge the scope of P-1 (athletes and entertainers) nonimmigrant visas to include: (1) a professional athlete; (2) a person who performs as an athlete, coach, or part of a team that is located in the United States and is a member of certain amateur foreign leagues or associations from which a significant number of individuals are drafted by major sports leagues or their minor league affiliates; and (3) a professional or amateur athlete who performs individually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production coming to the United States in a specific ice skating production or tour. (Currently such provision is limited to athletes performing at an "internationally recognized level of performance.")

Prohibits visa issuance to an alien from a country that is a state sponsor of international terrorism unless the Secretary of State determines that such alien is not a threat to U.S. security.

Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to permit: (1) a petition to seek P-1 classification for multiple alien athletes; and (2) athletes or their employers to seek admission for such athletes under other than P-1 provisions of INA if eligible under such other provisions.</summary>
