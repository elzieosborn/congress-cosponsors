Requires the institutions to report on such information annually to the campus community in a manner that will aid the prevention of similar occurrences.\n\nRequires the institutions to request their fraternities and sororities to collect and report such information for each building and property they own or control.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Education to report to Congress on fire safety systems in facilities of institutions of higher education and on fire safety standards in all such facilities."
