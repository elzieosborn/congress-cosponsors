Allows a waiver of such requirement for good cause shown. Requires such list and reports to be made available on publicly accessible websites of such stations.\n\nRequires the standards for a station's license renewal to include review of the licensee's other stations (if any).\n\nRequires the FCC, within nine months after the enactment of this Act, to complete action on two specified proceedings concerning disclosure requirements and public interest obligations of television broadcast licensees."
