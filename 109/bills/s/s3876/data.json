    "text": "National Security Surveillance Act of 2006 - Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (the Act) to establish a new title relating to electronic surveillance. Gives the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Court) (established under the Act) jurisdiction to review U.S. electronic surveillance programs (programs) that seek to obtain foreign intelligence information or to protect against international terrorism. Allows the Court to issue an order that authorizes a program for up to 90 days. Provides for congressional oversight of approved programs.\n\nProhibits any provision of the Act from being construed to limit the constitutional authority of the President to collect intelligence with respect to foreign powers and agents thereof.\n\nRevises generally provisions of the Act concerning electronic surveillance authorizations obtained without a court order, including certification by the Attorney General, reports to congressional committees, duties and compensation of common carriers required to perform, or make equipment available for, such surveillance, and application requirements."
