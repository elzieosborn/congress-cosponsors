Authorizes the FTC to disclose certain privileged or confidential information to foreign law enforcement agencies and to grant investigative assistance to them.

Authorizes the FTC to designate its attorneys to assist the Attorney General with litigation in foreign courts on particular matters in which it has an interest.

Prescribes procedural guidelines for sharing by FTC with foreign law enforcement agencies of information obtained pursuant to compulsory process or investigation.

Declares the FTC subject to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, but specifies conditions relating to procedures for delay of notification or prohibition of disclosure, and ex parte proceedings.
