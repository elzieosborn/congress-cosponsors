Numbers among such conditions the requirement that the state enact, and keep updated, laws or promulgate regulations equivalent to federal law or regulations regarding: (1) the environmental protection, safety, and operations of any operation pipeline in existence on the date of conveyance; and (2) valuation of oil, gas, or other mineral production from existing interests for royalty purposes.\n\nProvides that if any existing federal oil and gas or other mineral lease or unit would be divided by the expanded seaward boundary of a state, the federal interest in the leased minerals underlying the portion of the lease or unit that lies within the expanded submerged boundary shall not be considered to be conveyed to the state until the date on which the lease or unit expires or is relinquished by the United States."
