    "text": "Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2005 - Amends federal transportation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish an automated video image analysis pilot program in states with the highest rates of accidents at highway-rail grade crossings to record motorist violations at crossings equipped with automatic warning devices. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a plan to eliminate highway-rail grade crossings, with priority given to crossings where the number of accidents are high or there is insufficient or outdated protective equipment.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) review the safety of all public railway-highway grade crossings in the United States; and (2) compile and submit to Congress, based on such review, a list of the 5,000 railway-highway grade crossings most in need of safety improvements.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to award grants to states to make necessary improvements to crossings identified for elimination and improvement. Requires the Secretary, in awarding such grants, to: (1) give priority to projects to install automated warning systems at crossings in states with the highest number of accidents; and (2) strive to reduce the number of crossings without automated warning systems by not less than 50%.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) analyze all laws for preventing trespassing and vandalism on railroad property; and (2) develop model legislation providing for civil and criminal penalties for individuals who violate grade crossing signs, signals, or gates.\n\nRequires the Secretary to inspect annually at least 2% of all highway-rail grade crossings in the 10 states with the highest rates of collisions at such crossings.\n\nRequires the Secretary to investigate, and report to Congress, all fatal accidents in the United States (including fatal railroad accidents) that occur on or after enactment of this Act."
