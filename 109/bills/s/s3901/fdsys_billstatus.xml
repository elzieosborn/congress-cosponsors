        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p> <p>Military Commissions Act of 2006 - (Sec. 3) Authorizes the President to establish military commissions (commissions) for the trial of alien unlawful enemy combatants (combatants) engaged in hostilities against the United States for violations of the law of war and other offenses specifically made triable by commissions under this Act. Allows commissions to impose upon any person found guilty any sentence appropriate to the offense, including death or imprisonment for life. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to carry out such sentences. Requires an annual report from the Secretary to the congressional defense committees on any trials conducted.</p> <p>(Sec. 4) Amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to codify and establish procedures governing the use of commissions to try such combatants for violations of triable offenses. Prohibits the findings, holdings, and other precedents of commissions from being introduced or considered in any proceeding of a court-martial convened under the UCMJ.</p> <p>Makes eligible to serve on a commission any U.S. commissioned officer on active duty. Requires to be detailed to each commission a military judge, trial and military defense counsel, and reporters and interpreters. Requires at least five members in each commission.</p> <p>Prescribes commission pre-trial procedures, including charges and specifications. Prohibits a person from being required to testify against himself (compulsory self-incrimination) at a commission proceeding. Allows the admission of a statement obtained by alleged coercion not amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment only if the commission military judge finds that: (1) the totality of the circumstances under which the statement was made render it reliable and possessing sufficient probative value; and (2) the interests of justice would best be served by its admission.</p> <p>Prescribes commission trial procedures, including: (1) rules of evidence; (2) duties of trial and defense counsel; (3) pleas of the accused; (4) opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence; (5) the defense of lack of mental responsibility; and (6) the record of trial. Requires: (1) a two-thirds commission member vote for conviction; (2) a three-fourths member vote for a sentence of life imprisonment or confinement of more than ten years; and (3) a unanimous vote by at least 12 members in a case in which the death penalty is sought.
