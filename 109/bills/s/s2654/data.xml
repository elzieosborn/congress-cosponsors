Youth Financial Education Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a new title IV part D Promoting Youth Financial Literacy. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to state educational agencies to implement financial education programs for elementary and secondary school students.
