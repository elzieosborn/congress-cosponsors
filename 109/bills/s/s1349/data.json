Makes the CVSP be subject to the payment of fees (with limits) to a local franchising authority based on the gross revenue of the CVSP in that area.\n\nProhibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any state or political subdivision thereof from regulating the rates or any other aspect of the services provided by a CVSP.\n\nMakes current franchise agreements entered into between a franchising authority and a CVSP exempt from this Act for the term of such agreement."
