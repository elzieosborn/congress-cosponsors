  <summary date="2005-02-15T21:09:42Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Federal Aid Highways program to require a State agency with jurisdiction over the operation of a HOV facility to establish the occupancy requirements of vehicles operating on the facility.

Requires such agency to permit motorcycles and bicycles to use the HOV facility.

Permits a State agency to restrict use of the HOV facility by motorcycles or bicycles (or both) if it certifies to the Secretary of Transportation that such use would create a safety hazard.

Prescribes guidelines under which a State agency may permit use of an HOV facility by: (1) public transportation vehicles and high occupancy toll vehicles; (2) inherently low-emission vehicles and low emission and energy-efficient vehicles; and (3) advanced lean burn technology vehicles.

Permits tolls to be charged on a HOV facility on the Interstate System.

Requires a State agency that allows low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles to use a HOV facility to certify to the Secretary that it will establish: (1) a continuous monitoring, assessment, and reporting program regarding the impacts such vehicles may have on the operation of the facility and adjacent highways; and (2) an enforcement program that ensures the facility is operated in accordance with this Act.

Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection to issue a final rule establishing certification requirements for low emission and energy-efficient vehicles and for advanced lean burn technology vehicles.</summary>
