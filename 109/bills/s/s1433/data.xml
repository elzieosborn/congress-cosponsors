  <summary date="2005-08-29T21:38:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ready to Educate All Children Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to establish partnerships with high poverty local educational agencies or high poverty schools (local partners) to establish or enhance a clinically-based elementary or secondary school teacher training program. Requires grant priority to be given to an IHE, which is in partnership with a nonprofit organization that is a teacher union or group representing teachers in a school, and that proposes to establish a track for hiring teachers in urban or rural high need schools participating in the partnership prior to July 1 of an academic year. Requires an IHE receiving such a grant to: (1) establish a partnership with a local partner to establish or enhance such a program; (2) facilitate a partnership among the IHE's departments to ensure that future teachers are prepared to teach; and (3) implement a project-based assessment. Requires such IHE also to use grant funds for at least three activities listed.Makes a student who participates in a program funded under this Act eligible for student assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 during the student's fifth year of study for a teaching degree (if such clinically-based program is a teaching-degree study requirement).</summary>
