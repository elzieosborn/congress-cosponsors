  <summary date="2005-04-25T15:44:47Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Arrest Methamphetamine Act of 2005 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Attorney General, through the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), to make grants to States to address the manufacture, sale, and use of methamphetamine to enhance public safety, including for activities to: (1) arrest individuals violating methamphetamine related laws; (2) undertake methamphetamine clandestine lab seizures and environmental cleanup; (3) provide for community based education, awareness, and prevention; (4) provide child support and family services to assist methamphetamine users and their families; and (5) procure equipment, technology, or support systems, or pay for resources, where expenditures would result in reduction in methamphetamine use, sale, and manufacture. Sets forth application requirements.

Authorizes the Attorney General, through BJA, to make grants to States, Indian tribal governments, and multijurisdictional or regional consortia to develop a comprehensive, cooperative strategy to address the use, sale, and manufacture of methamphetamine. Allocates funding for enforcement.

Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) collect systematic data on the effectiveness of programs assisted under this Act; (2) establish a national clearinghouse of information on effective programs for dissemination to State and local agencies; (3) establish a program within the Department of Justice to facilitate the sharing of best practices among States; and (4) provide technical assistance to State and local agencies.

Urges the President to seek commitments from the Canadian Government to take effective measures to stem the availability of pseudoephedrine in Canada and its illegal importation into the United States.</summary>
