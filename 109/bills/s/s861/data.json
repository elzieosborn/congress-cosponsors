Prohibits plans that elect restructuring to accrue future unfunded pension plan liabilities. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to deny tax-exempt status to a successor of a plan restructured under this Act unless all benefit obligations of the restructured plan have been satisfied.\n\nAmends ERISA to exempt the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) from liability for any unfunded pension plan liabilities incurred by commercial passenger airline pension plans after an election to restructure is made."
