Authorizes such individuals, however, to communicate with and appear before any such department, agency, court, or commission on behalf of the Indian tribe on any matter (including, as currently, any matter in which the United States is a party or has direct and substantial interest).\n\nRevises requirements for notification by a former U.S. officer or employee of any personal and substantial involvement the individual may have had as a U.S. officer or employee with respect to the pending matter."
