Lists as purposes of the program: (1) to develop a global array of terrestrial and oceanographic indicators of paleoclimate in order to sufficiently identify and describe past instances of abrupt climate change; (2) to improve understanding of thresholds and nonlinearities in geophysical systems related to the mechanisms of abrupt climate change; (3) to incorporate such mechanisms into advanced geophysical models of climate change; and (4) to test the output of such models against an improved global array of records of past abrupt climate changes."
