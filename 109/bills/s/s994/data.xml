  <summary date="2006-11-24T15:37:01Z" status="Passed Senate amended">Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2006 - Directs the Attorney General to make grants to states for projects involving: (1) the extradition of individuals suspected of committing a family abduction; (2) the investigation by state and local law enforcement agencies of family abduction cases; (3) the training of such law enforcement agencies in responding to family abductions and recovering abducted children; (4) outreach and media campaigns to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions; and (5) the flagging (i.e., notifying law enforcement authorities of the name and address of any person requesting the school records of an abducted child) of school records.

Defines "family abduction" as the taking, keeping, or concealing of a child by a parent or other family member to prevent another individual from exercising lawful custody or visitation rights.

Requires that not less than 50% of the cost of a project for which a grant is made under this Act be provided by non-federal sources.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2010.</summary>
