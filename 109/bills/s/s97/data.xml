Big Horn Bentonite Act - (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (with the consent of the Secretary of the Army) to permit mining and removal of bentonite on certain land previously withdrawn for military purposes in Big Horn County, Wyoming.

Directs the Secretary to enter into a sole-source mining and removal of bentonite contract that provides for payment to the Secretary of $1.00 per ton of bentonite removed from such land.

Sets forth contract terms and conditions.

(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary, upon notification by the Secretary of the Army that closure of the land is required for purposes of either national emergency, national defense, or national security, to: (1) order the suspension of such authorized mining activity; and (2) close the land until the Secretary of the Army signals that the closure is no longer necessary.

Shields both Secretaries from liability for damages resulting from such closure.</summary>
