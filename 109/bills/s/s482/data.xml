Directs the Secretary to enter into local cooperation agreements with non-Federal interests for project design and construction. Sets the Federal share of project costs under local cooperation agreements at 75 percent.

Requires a reduction in the non-Federal share of the cost of constructing projects under this Act, using a Federal formula for water rate affordability, where the rate for affordability relating to the project area exceeds the average State-wide rate by a specified percentage.
