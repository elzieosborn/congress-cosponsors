    "text": "Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act - Amends federal transportation law to revise corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE Standards) for automobiles to exclude light trucks (currently, only passenger automobiles are excluded) from such standards. Prescribes graduated increased average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks beginning in model year 2009 in order to achieve a combined average fuel economy standard of at least 35 miles per gallon (or such other number of miles per gallon as the Secretary may prescribe) beginning in model year 2017. Prohibits such regulations from making any distinction between passenger automobiles and light trucks by not later than model year 2011 (effectively eliminating the SUV loophole). Sets forth minimum CAFE standards for domestic and foreign passenger automobiles manufactured in a model year prior to enactment of this Act.\n\nPrescribes maximum CAFE standards for: (1) work trucks manufactured beginning in model year 2011; and (2) light trucks manufactured beginning in model year 2009.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Transportation to issue a motor vehicle safety standard to reduce vehicle incompatibility and agressivity between passenger vehicles and non-passenger vehicles.\n\nRevises federal test procedures used to determine fuel economy values for labeling purposes to require such process to take into consideration certain current factors like speed limits, acceleration rates, and driving patterns for passenger automobiles by model year 2015.\n\nRequires passenger automobiles and light trucks be equipped with fuel economy indicators and devices beginning with model year 2013.\n\nEstablishes a CAFE credit trading program to allow manufacturers whose automobiles exceed CAFE standards to earn credits to be sold to manufacturers whose automobiles fail to achieve such standards.\n\nRevises fuel economy labeling requirements to require labels attached to passenger automobiles and light trucks to also include greenhouse gas and other emissions consequences information."
