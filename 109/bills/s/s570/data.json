Makes such advance directive requirements applicable under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act.\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the establishment of a national, toll-free, information clearinghouse for State-specific information regarding advance directives and end-of-life decisions.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to study and report on the feasibility of a national registry for advanced directives.\n\nRequires each State to establish a program that: (1) provides information to residents at the State's department of motor vehicles on the advance directives clearinghouse; and (2) is modeled after the State's organ donation program at the department of motor vehicles."
