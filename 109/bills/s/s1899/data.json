    "text": "Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act Amendments of 2006 - (Sec. 4) Amends the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act to require a local law enforcement or local child protective services agency's final written report on the investigation of any child abuse allegation to include any federal, state, or tribal final conviction. Requires transmission of a copy of the report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nRequires the FBI to maintain a record of each written report in a manner accessible to: (1) a local law enforcement agency that requires the information to carry out an official duty; and (2) any agency requesting the information for character investigations.\n\nRequires the FBI Director, in coordination with the Secretary and the Attorney General, to report annually to specified congressional committees on child abuse in Indian country.\n\nRequires the Secretary of the Interior to collect annually any information relating to: (1) the number of criminal and civil child abuse allegations, investigations, and prosecutions referred, declined, or deferred in Indian country; (2) the number of child abuse victims reported in Indian country; (3) sentencing patterns of individuals convicted of child abuse in Indian country; and (4) related rates of recidivism.\n\nPrescribes confidentiality guidelines for dealing with alleged child abuse victims.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to identify and report to specified congressional committees on any impediment to the reduction of child abuse in Indian country and on Indian reservations. Repeals the requirement for a study of the feasibility of establishing a Central Registry for reports on child abuse in Indian Country.\n\n(Sec. 6) Modifies confidentiality requirements to treat an Indian tribal government as an entity of the federal government for purposes of interagency sharing of child abuse incident investigation or treatment information.\n\n(Sec. 7) Allows for forensic examinations without parental consent if local child protective services or local law enforcement officials have reason to believe that the child has been subject to abuse.\n\nRequires any examination or interview of a child who may have been the subject of child sexual abuse to avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, subjecting the child to multiple interviews during the process.\n\n(Sec. 8) Requires character investigations of individuals in voluntary positions which involve regular contact with, or control over, Indian children.\n\nSpecifies child abuse and child neglect among the offenses to be included in a criminal records check portion of a character investigation.\n\nProvides that an Indian tribe that certifies that it has conducted a character investigation shall be considered to have satisfied the background investigation requirements of any federal law requiring one for the placement of an Indian child in a tribally-licensed or tribally-approved foster or adoptive home, or an institution.\n\n(Sec. 9) Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Indian child abuse treatment grant program for FY2007-FY2011.\n\n(Sec. 10) Revises requirements for Indian Child Resource and Family Services Centers. Requires establishment of such Centers in Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Regional Offices (currently, area offices). Requires the Attorney General to participate in Memoranda of Agreement providing for staffing of a Center.\n\nRequires the multidisciplinary team personnel of a Center to include individuals with backgrounds in adolescent mental and behavioral health (including suicide prevention and treatment), sexual assault, criminal prosecution, and medicine.\n\nRequires the consent form signature of an official of each Indian tribe or tribal consortium on the application to operate a Center located in any BIA Regional Center serving more than one tribe, or a Center located in the Alaska Region.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011.\n\n(Sec. 11) Extends for FY2007-FY2011 the authorization of appropriations for financial assistance to any Indian tribe, tribal organization, or intertribal consortium for development of an Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Program.\n\n(Sec. 12) Authorizes the Indian Health Service (IHS) to enter into any contract or agreement for the use of telemedicine with a medical university or facility, or any private practitioner, experienced in pediatrics to diagnose and treat child abuse. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011."
