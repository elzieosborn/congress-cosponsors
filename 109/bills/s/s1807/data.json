    "text": "Small Business Hurricane Relief and Reconstruction Act of 2005 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make loans of up to $10 million aggregate to a nonprofit organization located or operating in a disaster area (as designated by the President as a result of Hurricane Katrina or Rita) or providing services to persons who have evacuated from a disaster area. Defers disaster loan payments to the later of one year after the date of enactment of this Act or one year from the date of issuance of the loan (but allows the Administrator to extend such deferral until two years after either date). Authorizes the refinancing of any loan or business debt related to such disasters that was outstanding on August 24, 2005.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to make loans to small businesses or cooperatives that demonstrate a direct adverse economic impact caused by either Hurricane Katrina or Rita.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to make loans to small businesses that have or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury on or after August 24, 2005, as the result of a significant increase in the price of heating oil, natural gas, propane, or kerosene. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize such loans for farms that are also a small business and that suffer substantial economic injury after such date as the result of a significant increase in energy or input costs.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to: (1) make supplemental emergency loans to small businesses located anywhere in the United States that are directly adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita; and (2) guarantee timely payment on any debentures issued by small business development companies after Hurricane Katrina or Rita.\n\nIncreases authorized funding for small business loan programs. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Commerce for grants to state government agencies in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and Florida, for relief from damages caused by Hurricane Katrina or Rita.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations to the SBA for specified small business development and counseling activities.\n\nDirects or authorizes the Administrator, with respect to small businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita, to: (1) establish a contracting outreach and technical assistance program; (2) provide performance bonding; and (3) increase the goal of participation in federal prime contracts and subcontracts."
