  <summary date="2006-02-03T15:45:38Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose an excise tax on integrated oil companies for 50% of their windfall profit from the sale of all barrels of taxable crude oil for taxable years beginning in 2005; (2) allow a tax deduction for the payment of any such windfall profit tax; and (3) grant certain individual taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes not exceeding $40,000 an income tax rebate of $450. Requires payment of such rebate not later than March 1, 2006.

Defines "windfall profit" as the excess of the removal (sales) price of a barrel of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price ($40 per barrel) of such barrel.</summary>
