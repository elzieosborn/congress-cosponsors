Provides that the District shall not be required to provide additional consideration for this conveyance. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the reclamation fund in the Treasury to the Secretary specified funds, which shall be derived from amounts collected by the Western Area Power Administration for the sale of electricity from the Loveland Area Projects.

Directs the Secretary: (1) if the transferred water distribution facilities have not been conveyed to the District within one year after this Act's enactment, to submit to specified congressional committees a report that describes the reasons for the failure to convey such facilities and the schedule for completing the transfer as soon as practicable; and (2) to provide annual reports until the date on which such facilities are conveyed.</summary>
