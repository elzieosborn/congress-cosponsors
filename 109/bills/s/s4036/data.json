Prohibits funds made available for obligation under this procedure from being proposed for rescission again.\n\nSets forth requirements for: (1) the President's transmittal to Congress of a special message regarding a proposed rescission; (2) a maximum 25% ceiling on amounts subject to rescission; and (3) expedited congressional consideration of such proposal.\n\nMakes it out of order in the Senate to consider any direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget deficit for: (1) the first year or first five fiscal years covered by the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; or (2) the five fiscal years following such fiscal years.\n\nAmends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to retain (by eliminating the expiration of) pay-as-you-go requirements.\n\nExtends specified budget enforcement mechanisms through FY2011."
