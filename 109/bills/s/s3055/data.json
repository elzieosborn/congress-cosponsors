    "text": "Family-Based Meth Treatment Access Act of 2006 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to expand the grant program to provide residential substance abuse treatment to pregnant and postpartum women to include: (1) parenting women substance abuse treatment (including treatment for addiction to methamphetamine); and (2) outpatient treatment services. Requires that such treatment programs be accessible to pregnant and parenting women in health disparity populations. Gives priority in awarding grants to any entity that agrees to use the award for programs serving: (1) an area that is a rural area, an area with a shortage of mental health professionals, or an area with a shortage of family-based substance abuse treatment options; or (2) an area that has high rates of addiction to methamphetamine or other drugs.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to award grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts for the purpose of assisting local jails and detention facilities in providing comprehensive, family-based substance abuse treatment services to pregnant and parenting adults who are considered nonviolent offenders. Sets forth criteria that must be met if such a grant is used for a family drug treatment program that is an alternative to incarceration."
