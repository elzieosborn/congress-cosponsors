Directs the Secretary to award grants to eligible entities for development and evaluation of such measures.

Requires the Secretary to establish demonstration projects in each of three specified categories to advance quality and performance in the delivery of medical assistance to children under Medicaid. Makes appropriations for such projects

Directs the Secretary to implement a four-year program to develop, implement, and evaluate a pay-for-performance program for eligible children's hospitals providing critical access to children eligible for Medicaid. Makes apppropriations for such four year program.
