    "text": "Agricultural Security Assistance Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) determine the best use of epidemiologists, computer modelers, and statisticians as members of emergency response task forces that handle foreign or emerging agricultural disease emergencies, and identify necessary data for proper modeling and analysis of such emergencies; (2) provide grants to States to use a geographic information system or statistical model for an epidemiological assessment in the event of such an emergency; (3) implement an on-farm biosecurity awareness campaign, and a biosecurity grant pilot program; (4) require that Department of Agriculture-accredited veterinarians be trained to recognize foreign animal diseases; and (5) prepare studies on foreign plant disease vaccines and the establishment of a national plant disease laboratory.\n\nProvides for regional, State, local, and international agricultural preparedness and information sharing. Sets forth responsibilities of the Departments of Agriculture, State, Transportation, and Homeland Security, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nDirects the Attorney General to review State and local laws relating to agroterrorism and biosecurity to determine: (1) the extent to which the laws facilitate or impede implementation of a Federal agricultural disease response plan; (2) whether a State injunction could delay implementation of such a plan, or affect an agricultural disease's spread; and (3) the legal evidence that may be required by a State court before a response plan may be implemented."
