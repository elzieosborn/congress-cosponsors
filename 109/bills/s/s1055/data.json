    "text": "No Child Left Behind Improvement Act of 2005 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, to subject to school facility capacity requirements the obligation of a local educational agency (LEA) to provide a public school choice option for students to transfer under certain conditions.\n\nAuthorizes school construction and renovation grants to LEAs experiencing school overcrowding, with priority to LEAs having difficulty in meeting public school choice requirements.\n\nRevises requirements for: (1) supplemental educational services personnel qualifications, and nondiscrimination in such services; and (2) state qualifications for teachers and paraprofessionals.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Education to improve coordination among teacher quality programs authorized under ESEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998.\n\nDirects the Secretary to require LEAs and state educational agencies (SEAs) to give schools and LEAs, respectively, an opportunity to request a review of a determination that they did not make adequate yearly progress (AYP) for the 2002-2003 school year. Prohibits the Secretary, an SEA, or an LEA, with respect to subsequent determinations of whether a school is subject to school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring as a result of not making AYP, from taking into account a 2002-2003 non-AYP determination that was revised under this Act, if the school received a final determination of AYP for such school year.\n\nAuthorizes competitive grants to SEAs for increasing state and local data system capacity for assessment and accountability.\n\nRequires competitive grants to SEAs or SEA consortia to collaborate with institutions of higher education and research organizations in designing, improving, and ensuring accurate assessments of academic content and achievement standards for students who are limited English proficient and students with disabilities."
