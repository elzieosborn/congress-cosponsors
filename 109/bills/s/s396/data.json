    "text": "Child Custody Protection Act - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit transporting a minor across a state line to obtain an abortion (deems such transporting to be a de facto abridgment of the right of a parent under any law in the minor\u0092s state of residence that requires parental involvement in the minor\u0092s abortion decision). Makes an exception for an abortion necessary to save the life of the minor.\n\nProtects from prosecution or civil liability the minor or the minor\u0092s parents for violations of this Act.\n\nMakes it an affirmative defense to a prosecution or civil action under this Act that a defendant reasonably believed that before the minor obtained the abortion, the required parental consent or notification or judicial authorization took place.\n\nAuthorizes any parent who suffers harm from a violation of this Act to seek relief in a civil action. Defines \"parent\" to include a guardian, legal custodian, or person standing in loco parentis."
