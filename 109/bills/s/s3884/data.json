Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591 (embargo on military assistance to Sudan).\n\nStates that certain restrictions against the government of Sudan shall remain in place until the President makes specified certifications to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the government of Sudan. Amends the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act to repeal provisions authorizing the President to provide additional assistance to, and exempting prohibitions on exports from, areas outside the control of the government of Sudan.\n\nAmends the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 to repeal the provision authorizing the President to provide additional nonmilitary assistance to areas outside the control of the government of Sudan.\n\nAuthorizes the President, subject to congressional notification by the Secretary of State, to provide economic assistance for Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, and Abyei.\n\nAuthorizes the President to provide specified military assistance to the government of Sudan.\n\nWaives prohibitions concerning Sudan in Executive Order No. 13067 regarding activities with respect to Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, and Abyei."
