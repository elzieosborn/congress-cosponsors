Allows a carrier to designate one or more participating networks or one or more health care panels, or both, to provide medical services to employees.\n\nModifies the formula used to determine disability compensation, including for loss of hearing.\n\nIncreases allowed funeral expenses.\n\nRevises requirements for: (1) determination of death compensation to survivors; (2) timing and recipients of a notice of such injury or death; (3) filing of claims; (4) date of payment of compensation; (5) assignment and exemption from the claims of creditors; (6) presumptions, burdens, and rules of evidence; (7) review of compensation orders; (8) modification of compensation awards for fraud or overpayment; (9) reports of fraud; and (10) payments into the special fund in the absence of an entitled survivor of an employee."
