    "text": "Trade Adjustment Assistance Improvement Act of 2005- Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to prohibit an adversely affected worker that would otherwise be entitled to a trade readjustment allowance (TRA) from being denied such allowance because of a pending judicial or administrative appeal regarding denial by the Secretary of Labor of a trade adjustment assistance (TAA) petition.\n\nEstablishes the Office of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Advisor in the Department of Labor.\n\nRequires an employer's legal counsel or officer to certify any TAA petitions submitted to the Secretary as well as the accuracy or completeness of any requested evidence or information regarding the petition.\n\nModifies TAA certification requirements for a group of workers (including those in any agricultural firm or subdivision) where there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to a foreign country of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or subdivision. Repeals the additional requirements that: (1) such country be a party to a free trade agreement with the United States or a beneficiary country under the Andean Trade Preference Act, African Growth and Opportunity Act, or the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act; or (2) there has been or is likely to be an increase in imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or subdivision.\n\nChanges eligibility requirements for the demonstration project for alternative trade adjustment assistance for older workers.\n\n\n\nRevises TRA eligibility requirements for adversely affected workers to: (1) extend training enrollment deadlines and TRA to accommodate such training; (2) modify funding for TRA training; and (3) include integrated workforce and entrepreneurial training in TRA approved training programs.\n\nTrade Adjustment Assistance Accountability Act - Requires the Secretary to collect necessary data and establish an effective performance measuring system to evaluate: (1) TAA program performance and participation before and after the effective date of Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002; and (2) ensure state participation in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nMakes fishermen who harvest wild stock eligible for TAA.\n\nModifies TAA group eligibility requirements for agricultural commodity producers."
