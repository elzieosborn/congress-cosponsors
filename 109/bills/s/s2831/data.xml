  <summary date="2006-06-03T16:10:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Free Flow of Information Act of 2006 - Prohibits federal courts in criminal or civil proceedings from compelling journalists to disclose their confidential sources or information which they obtain in a professional newsgathering capacity. Allows exceptions if a court finds that: (1) alternative means of obtaining such confidential information have been exhausted and reasonable and timely notice of a demand for such information has been given; (2) subpoenas for such information are limited in scope; (3) such information is critical to pending criminal or civil litigation; and (4) nondisclosure of such information would be contrary to the public interest.

Denies journalists a privilege against disclosure of confidential information if such information: (1) was obtained by eyewitness observations of criminal conduct by a journalist or involvement of such journalist in criminal or tortious conduct; (2) is necessary to prevent death or substantial bodily harm; (3) is necessary to protect national security; and (4) was provided or obtained without a promise of confidentiality.</summary>
