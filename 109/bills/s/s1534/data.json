Authorizes the Secretary to withdraw certification of any food from a foreign government or foreign facility if: (1) such food is linked to an outbreak of human illness; (2) the Secretary finds that the programs and procedures are no longer equivalent to U.S. programs and procedures; or (3) there is a refusal to allow U. S. officials to conduct appropriate audits and investigations.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to assess and report on U.S. food supply security."
