Allows travel reimbursement only from charitable organizations not affiliated with any group that lobbies before Congress.\n\nAmends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit a political committee from being designated as an authorized committee if a registered lobbyist is formally affiliated with it."
