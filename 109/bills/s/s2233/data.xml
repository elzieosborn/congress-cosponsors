  <summary date="2006-03-10T21:46:21Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Lobbyist Reform Act of 2006 - Amends the federal criminal code to extend from one to two years the ban on lobbying contacts by former Members of Congress, elected officers of either chamber, or a congressional employee with a Member, officer, congressional employee, and employee of any other congressional legislative office.

Amends the Standing Rules of the Senate to: (1) exclude gifts from lobbyists from the gift ban exceptions; and (2) prohibit reimbursement from individuals for travel by a Member, officer, or employee. Allows travel reimbursement only from charitable organizations not affiliated with any group that lobbies before Congress.

Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit a political committee from being designated as an authorized committee if a registered lobbyist is formally affiliated with it.</summary>
