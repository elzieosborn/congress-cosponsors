  <summary date="2005-05-24T14:48:24Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Help Expand Access to Recovery and Treatment Act of 2005 or the HEART Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit a group health plan or group health coverage that provides both medical and surgical benefits and substance abuse benefits from imposing treatment limitations or financial requirements on the substance abuse treatment benefits unless similar limitations or requirements are imposed for medical and surgical benefits. Excludes such requirements for plans and coverage for small employers and for cases in which the application of such requirements results in an increase in the cost under the plan of at least one percent.

Applies such requirements to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market.</summary>
