  <summary date="2006-11-20T21:05:28Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act - Prohibits any federal funds from being provided to a hospital unless the hospital meets certain conditions related to a woman who is a victim of sexual assault, including that the hospital: (1) provides the woman with accurate and unbiased information about emergency contraception; (2) offers emergency contraception to the woman; (3) provides the woman such contraception at the hospital on her request; and (4) does not deny any such services because of the inability of the woman to pay.

Prohibits any federal funds from being provided to a hospital unless the hospital provides to survivors of sexual assault, regardless of ability to pay: (1) an assessment of the individual's risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections; (2) advice concerning significantly prevalent infections for which effective post-exposure prophylaxis exists and for which the deferral of treatment either would significantly reduce treatment efficacy or would pose substantial risk to the individual's health; and (3) such prophylactic treatment for infections, upon request.</summary>
