Provides that such research may include: (1) research in animals to develop and test techniques for deriving cells from embryos without doing harm to embryos; (2) research to develop and test techniques for producing human pluripotent stems cells without creating or making use of embryos; and (3) research to isolate, develop, and test pluripotent stem cells from postnatal tissues, umbilical cord blood, and placenta.\n\nProhibits research under this Act that: (1) involves the use of human embryos; (2) involves the use of stem cells not otherwise eligible for NIH funds; (3) involves the use of any stem cell to create or to attempt to create a human embryo; or (4) poses a significant risk of creating a human embryo by any means."
