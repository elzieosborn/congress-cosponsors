Makes persons who receive such military-type training subject to removal to the same degree that they would be inadmissible.\n\nStates that this Act's amendments to the INA shall apply to: (1) all aliens subject to removal, deportation, or exclusion at any time; and (2) acts and conditions constituting grounds for inadmissibility, exclusion, deportation, or removal occurring or existing before, on, or after the date of enactment.\n\nAmends the Federal criminal code to increase penalties and establish mandatory minimum sentences for providing material support to terrorists or designated foreign terrorist organizations and for receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization."
