Changes the effective date of such state law restrictions from October 9, 1969, to March 1, 1985, and requires that they be continuously in effect only through the bond issue's date of issue.\n\nExtends such rule, as an alternative, to specified securities or obligations held in a fund whose annual distributions cannot exceed 7% of the average fair market value of the assets held in the fund, except to the extent distributions are necessary to pay debt service on the bond issue."
