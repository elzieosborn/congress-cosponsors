    "text": "IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 2005 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to review requirements outlined in a specified FCC report and order and, within 120 days after enactment of this Act, establish requirements that are technologically and operationally feasible for providers of IP-enabled voice service to ensure that 911 and E (enhanced)-911 services are available to subscribers of IP-enabled voice services. Requires the FCC to issue regulations regarding access to 911 components by IP-enabled voice service providers. Defines \"IP-enabled voice service\" as certain real-time two-way voice communications offered, or effectively available, to the public, transmitted using TCP/IP or a successor protocol, for a fee and with two-way interconnection capability such that the service can originate traffic to, and terminate traffic from, the public switched telephone network.\n\nAllows a provider of IP-enabled voice service to continue to provide non-911 or E-911 service to subscribers who had subscribed as of December 31, 2005, and to whom notice has been given of the unavailability of such service. Requires such a provider, each six months, to file a report with the FCC detailing its efforts to identify and implement a 911 or E-911 solution, or both.\n\nAllows the FCC to waive its 911 or E-911 service requirements if: (1) the provider gives to subscribers separate and clear notice that it does not offer such service to its customers; (2) the subscriber separately acknowledges receipt of such notice in writing or by electronic means; and (3) the provider demonstrates that it is not technologically or operationally feasible to comply with the 911 or E-911 requirements. Limits: (1) each waiver to a 12-month period; and (2) the waiver authority period to 48 months after the enactment of this Act.\n\nProvides for parity of protection with respect to immunity and other protection from liability under federal and state law for a provider or user of IP-enabled voice services, a public safety answering point (PSAP), and the officers, employees and authorizing government entity, if any, of such provider, user, or PSAP.\n\nProvides for FCC enforcement of the requirements of this Act.\n\nAmends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to direct the E-911 Implementation Coordination Office to develop and report to Congress on a national plan for migrating to a national IP-enabled emergency network capable of receiving and responding to all citizen-activated emergency communications.\n\nRequires the FCC to: (1) compile a list of all known PSAPs; (2) organize such list by county, town, or other political subdivision of a state; and (3) make available from such list to the public, on the Internet website of the FCC, the 10-digit telephone number of each PSAP so listed. Directs the FCC to take similar action with respect to selective routers, and to make such list available to providers of telecommunications services and to providers of IP-enabled voice service who are seeking to provide E-911 service to their subscribers."
