  <summary date="2005-03-04T19:57:58Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Small Business Federal Contractor Safeguard Act of 2005 - Amends the Small Business Act to prohibit an official of a military department, Defense Agency, or the Department of Defense Field Activity, or the head of any other Federal agency from executing an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements with a total value above specified amounts unless the senior procurement executive first: (1) conducts market research; (2) identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve less consolidation; and (3) determines that the consolidation is necessary and justified. Defines "consolidation of defense requirements" as the use of a solicitation to obtain offers for a single contract to satisfy two or more requirements for goods or services that have previously been provided under separate contracts for a smaller cost or are capable of being so provided.

Requires each procurement employee to communicate to their subordinates the importance of achieving small business goals and include the success of such an employee in small business utilization as an annual performance evaluation factor.

Requires small business subcontracting plans to include a certification that the offeror or bidder will acquire articles or services from small businesses in the amount used in preparing the bid or proposal.

Requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to share subcontracting compliance review data with Federal contracting officers and to update a national centralized Government-wide database with such information.

Requires annual reports from the Associate Administrator of Business Development to the small business committees on the effectiveness of the BusinessLINC program.</summary>
