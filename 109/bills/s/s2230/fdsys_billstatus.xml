        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Servicemember Safety Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of each military department to ensure that each Armed Forces member who is ordered, assigned, or deployed to a combat zone or a combat operation (covered member) is provided with interceptor body armor and such other appropriate protective gear so as to provide such covered member with complete personal armored protection. Sets forth an exception to such requirement if a unit commander of a covered member certifies that the provision of complete personal armored protection to the covered member would impose a greater risk of injury or death than if the member were provided with less than complete personal armored protection. Requires each relevant Secretary to provide an amount to a covered member for the purchase, or for the reimbursement of purchases made by others on behalf of the covered member, of such interceptor body armor and other appropriate protective gear. Limits the total payment to a covered member to no more than the lesser of $1,100 or the amount incurred by or on behalf of the covered member to purchase the body armor and other gear.</p>]]></text>
