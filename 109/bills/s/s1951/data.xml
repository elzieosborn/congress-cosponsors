  <summary date="2005-12-20T21:23:54Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act or the CLASS Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to create a national, voluntary disability insurance program (CLASS program) under which: (1) all employees are automatically enrolled, but are allowed to waive enrollment; (2) payroll deductions pay monthly premiums; and (3) two-tiered benefits are provided, based on the level of disability, to purchase nonmedical services and supports that the beneficiary needs to maintain independence.

Establishes the Independence Fund within the Treasury.

Requires the CLASS program to be treated for tax purposes in the same manner as a qualified long-term care insurance contract.

Amends the Social Security Act to require each state to: (1) assess the extent to which personal care services providers are serving or able to serve as fiscal agents, employers, and providers of employment-related benefits for personal care attendant workers, who provide personal care services to individuals receiving benefits under this Act; (2) designate or create entities to serve such purposes; and (3) ensure that such entities will not impede the ability of individuals to retain, manage, or dismiss such workers or inhibit individuals from relying on family members for such services.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Personal Care Attendants Workforce Advisory Panel to examine and advise the Secretary and Congress on workforce issues related to personal care attendant workers.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) a deduction for premiums paid for the CLASS program; (2) a credit for low-income CLASS program enrollees; and (3) a credit for employers for the cost incurred to automatically enroll employees and withhold monthly premiums.</summary>
