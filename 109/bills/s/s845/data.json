Repeals provisions phasing in the full concurrent receipt of such pay through December 31, 2013.\n\nMakes eligible for the full concurrent receipt of both veterans' disability compensation and either military retired pay or combat-related special pay those individuals who were retired or separated from military service due to a service-connected disability."
