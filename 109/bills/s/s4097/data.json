Authorizes the Administrator to enter into agreements with private contractors to process disaster loans. Requires the Administrator to amend the 2006 hurricane season disaster response plan to apply to major disasters and catastrophic national disasters. Provides for increased congressional oversight of the SBA disaster loan program with respect to presidentially declared disasters.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to make loans to assist small businesses that have or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury as the result of significant increases in the price of heating fuel due to a disaster-related energy emergency."
