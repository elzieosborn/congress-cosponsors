    "text": "Getting Results for Advanced Degrees Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize provisions relating to graduate student assistance.\n\nExtends and increases the authorization of appropriations for: (1) Jacob K. Javits Fellowships (Javits Fellows); and (2) graduate assistance in areas of national need. Sets the amount of a stipend under both such programs at the same level as the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, without regard to financial need. Revises Board membership requirements under the Javits Fellows program.\n\nEstablishes, and authorizes appropriations for, the Patsy T. Mink Fellowship program of awards to assist highly qualified minorities and women to acquire the doctoral degree, or highest possible degree available, in academic areas in which such individuals are underrepresented, to enable them to enter the higher education professoriate.\n\nRevises cost of attendance calculations for graduate students with one or more dependents to include actual living expenses incurred for dependents, including their room, board and health insurance (as well as, currently, dependent care).\n\nIncreases unsubsidized Stafford loan limits for graduate and professional students.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to treat reasonable room, board, and special needs services allowances as part of permitted higher education expenses, in cases of qualified scholarships or of tuition reduction programs for teaching and research assistants.\n\nAmends HEA, as amended by the Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004, to provide for further reduction of certain special allowances to lenders and holders of student loans. Directs the Secretary to use any funds made available thereby to carry out programs and activities under this Act."
