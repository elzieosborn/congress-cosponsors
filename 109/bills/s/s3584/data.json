    "text": "Federal Supervisor Training Act of 2006 - Revises provisions relating to specific training programs for managers of federal agencies. Specifies that the head of each federal agency shall establish: (1) a program to provide training to supervisors on prohibited personnel practices; and (2) a program under which experienced supervisors mentor new supervisors.\n\nDirects the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue guidance to federal agencies on standards supervisors are expected to meet in order to effectively manage, and be accountable for managing, the performance of employees. Requires each agency to: (1) develop standards to assess the performance of each supervisor and, in developing such standards, to consider such guidance developed by OPM and any other qualifications or factors determined by the agency; (2) assess the overall capacity of the supervisors in the agency to meet such guidance; and (3) develop and implement a supervisor training program to strengthen issues identified during such assessment. Instructs each agency, every year, or on any basis requested by the Director of OPM, to submit a report to OPM on the progress of such agency in implementing the requirements specified above with respect to developing those standards."
