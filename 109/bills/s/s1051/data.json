    "text": "Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require that recipients of certain grants related to HIV research and services for women, infants, and children agree to provide coordinated, family-centered care. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to award grants to provide health care and other supportive services to youth with HIV designed to recruit and retain youth in care.\n\nRequires that chief elected officials in eligible areas and states prioritize certain grant funds using HIV case data rather than AIDS case data. Requires the Secretary to report on the status of using such HIV case data and the impact of this transition on the resources directed to women, infants, children, and youth.\n\nRequires the Secretary to award demonstration grants to public and nonprofit private entities to conduct assessments of the effectiveness of certain strategies in reducing the mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\nRequires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), acting through the Director of the Office of AIDS Research, to report on activities related to the testing of potential HIV vaccine candidates in relevant pediatric populations.\n\nRequires the Commission of Food and Drugs to issue guidance on the minimum requirements for obtaining Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to test an HIV vaccine in pediatric populations and for a pediatric indication of an HIV vaccine.\n\nRequires the Director of NIH to invest in domestic and international research on specified topics related to HIV and pediatric populations."
