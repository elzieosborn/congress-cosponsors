    "text": "Widows and Orphans Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to create a new special immigrant visa category N for certain alien minors and females referred by a U.S. Government agency who have a credible fear of harm due to age or sex and who lack adequate protection.\n\nStates that special immigrant status for such individuals shall be adjudicated within 45 days and that, if granted, the alien shall be paroled into the United States and allowed to apply for adjustment of status within one year of arrival.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to specified congressional committees on progress toward implementing the N visa provisions of this Act.\n\nBars an alien's admission into the United States until a search of each database maintained by a Federal agency or department has been conducted to determine whether the alien is ineligible for admission on criminal, security, or related grounds. Requires aliens to be fingerprinted and to submit such fingerprints and other required biometric data to the Secretary within 30 days of entry. Requires completion of database searches within 180 days of entry.\n\nAuthorizes administrative review of a determination that an alien is ineligible for admission on criminal, security, or related grounds based on a database search. Precludes judicial review of such determinations."
