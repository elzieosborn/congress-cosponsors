Limits federal funds available for such assistance to 75 percent of total project costs.\n\nAmends the WRDA to authorize the Secretary of the Army to provide funding for implementation of a combined sewer overflow control plan in the District of Columbia.\n\nRequires the Secretary, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to establish a program to provide environmental assistance to non-federal interests in the Anacostia River Basin.
