Provides for the continued education of students affected by Hurricane Katrina.

Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to transfer funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund for Hurricane Katrina to the Department of Education, upon the Secretary of Education's request, to assist educational agencies serving such students in paying for costs of personnel, operations, and materials and equipment.

Requires the Secretary of Education to: (1) determine an immediate need for such assistance before requesting such a funds transfer; and (2) obligate certain funds for an additional year as emergency funding to meet the students' educational needs.

Shortens the period for certain advance notifications to Congress under the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005, in particular the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2005.</summary>
