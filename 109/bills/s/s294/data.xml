  <summary date="2005-03-07T21:17:56Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Applies the Code of Federal Regulations as amended by the final rule issued by the Secretary of Agriculture on January 4, 2005 (and any successor regulations) restricting importation from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) minimal-risk regions of meat and edible products from ruminants only to meat, meat byproducts, and meat food products derived from a bovine that is slaughtered at less than 30 months of age.

Provides that if the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate officials in such a minimal risk region, determines that the region is in full compliance with a ruminant feed ban and other BSE safeguards, the Secretary: (1) shall report to specified congressional committees on the determination; and (2) may promulgate regulations to allow such rules to apply to meat, meat byproducts, and meat food products derived from a class of bovines in the region that is determined by the Secretary by the regulations.</summary>
