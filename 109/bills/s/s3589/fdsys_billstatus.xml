        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

and (2) continue to work with the insurance industry, state insurance regulators, and other interested parties to implement the minimum training and education standards for all insurance agents who sell flood insurance policies.</p> <p>(Sec. 24) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to certain congressional committees regarding: (1) &quot;Write Your Own Policies&quot; issued by entities authorized by the Director; (2) an audit of financial transactions of the National Flood Insurance Program relating to the consequences of Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes of the 2005 season; (3) specified aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program, including an evaluation and analysis of it; (4) the composition of the remaining pre-FIRM structures explicitly receiving discounted premium rates under the Act, including the historical basis for such subsidy and whether it has outlasted its purpose; and (5) the feasibility of allowing individuals who reside in communities not currently participating in the National Flood Insurance Program to purchase flood insurance from the Program.</p> <p>Instructs the Director to report annually to certain congressional committees on the operations, activities, budget, receipts, and expenditures of the National Flood Insurance Program for the preceding 12-month period.</p>]]></text>
