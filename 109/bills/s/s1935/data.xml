  <summary date="2005-11-30T20:56:46Z" status="Introduced in Senate">International Fund for Ireland Enhancement Act of 2005 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) U.S. assistance for the International Fund for Ireland has contributed greatly to the economic development of Northern Ireland and that both objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986, economic development and reconciliation, remain critical to achieving peace in the region, especially in the economically-depressed areas; and (2) the Fund is encouraged to support programs that enhance relations between communities and enhance relations between the police and the communities they serve, promote human rights training for police, and enhance peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of continued conflict.

Amends the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 to encourage the Fund to support programs that: (1) enhance relations between communities, and between the police and the communities they serve; (2) promote human rights training for police; (3) enhance peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of continued conflict; (4) promote training programs to enhance the new district partnership police boards recommended by the Patten Commission; and (5) assist in the transition of former British military installations and prisons into sites for peaceful, community-supported activities, such as housing, retail, and commercial development.

Authorizes FY2006-FY2007 appropriations for U.S. contributions to the Fund. Expresses the sense of Congress that at least 35% of such amount for each such fiscal year should be used to carry out programs to improve local community relations and relations between the police and the people they serve.</summary>
