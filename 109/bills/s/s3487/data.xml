Directs the Administrator to make supplemental emergency loans after disasters.

Amends the Robert T.

Waives: (1) certain major disaster loan limits; and (2) geographic restrictions on small business development center counseling following a major disaster.

Requires a monthly report from the Administrator to the congressional small business committees on the SBA disaster loan program.

Provides SBA grant assistance for military reservists' small businesses.

Authorizes the Administrator to make loans to small businesses that: (1) have suffered or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury on or after August 24, 2005, as the result of significant increases in the price of heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, propane, or kerosene; and (2) if engaged in the heating oil business, sell not more than 10 million gallons of heating oil per year.</summary>
