  <summary date="2006-09-02T14:24:49Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 20, 2006. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends the Public Health Service Act to change the duration of voluntary service that may be accepted from an individual provided by the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to aid or facilitate the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from a maximum of two years to until such time as the private funding for such individual ends.

Requires the Foundation to: (1) include an accounting of the use of funds transferred from the CDC to the Foundation in its annual report; and (2) submit such reports to the appropriate congressional committees.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make available not less than $500,000 and not more than $1,250,000 to the Foundation each fiscal year and increases the amount authorized to be appropriated for grants for such purpose.

Allows the Director to provide facilities, utilities, and support services to the Foundation upon a determination that such support would be advantageous to CDC programs.</summary>
