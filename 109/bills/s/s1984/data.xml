Requires the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to: (1) provide information to members and employees of the Network with appropriate security clearance; and (2) assign CIA employees to work on achieving suchpolicies, objectives, and priorities.

Requires the agencies in the Network to: (1) share the information they collect; (2) coordinate civil and criminal actions related to intellectual property rights; (3) establish formal processes for working with state and local government agencies and consulting with companies, labor unions, writers, artists, and other interested persons and groups; and (4) consult with the Register of Copyrights on law enforcement matters.

Urges the President and relevant agency officers, when meeting with certain foreign countries, to stress the importance of establishing and participating in the international task force.

Calls for other government intellectual property initiatives to be consolidated into the work of the Network to prevent duplication.
