Preserves authority of network operators to: (1) protect subscribers from adware, viruses, spam, content deemed inappropriate for minors, and other applications or service that harms the Internet experience of subscribers; and (2) support an application or service intended to prevent such adware, viruses, content, etc.\n\nAllows an aggrieved party to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with respect to alleged network operator violations of such requirements. Provides deadlines with respect to complaint consideration and rulings.\n\nProvides violator penalties."
