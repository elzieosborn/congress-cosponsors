Authorizes the Secretary to accept the services of a volunteer in hazardous duty only if the Secretary determines that the volunteer is skilled in performing hazardous activities. Directs the Secretary to ensure that an appropriate U.S. officer or employee provides adequate and appropriate supervision of each individual that volunteers under this Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to provide for services and costs incidental to the use of volunteers under this Act."
