  <summary date="2006-07-11T17:16:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act - Prohibits a person from carrying out a demonstration: (1) at a cemetery under the control of the National Cemetery Administration or at Arlington National Cemetery, unless the demonstration has been approved by the cemetery superintendent or director; or (2) within 500 feet of a cemetery at which a funeral or memorial service is to be held, for a period beginning 60 minutes before and ending 60 minutes after the funeral or service, if such demonstration includes any individual making noise or a diversion that disturbs the peace or good order of the funeral or service.

Amends the federal criminal code to provide criminal penalties for violations of such prohibitions.

Expresses the sense of Congress that each state should enact legislation to restrict demonstrations near any military funeral.</summary>
