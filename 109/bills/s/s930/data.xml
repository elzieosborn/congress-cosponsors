Requires the Drug Safety and Risk Management Drug Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the Director on postmarket studies, drugs and biological products that may present an unreasonable risk, and appropriate corrective actions.

Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to assess civil penalties for violations of this Act.
