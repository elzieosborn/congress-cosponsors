    "text": "Christen O'Donnell Equestrian Helmet Safety Act of 2006 - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to award grants to states, political subdivisions, Indian tribes and organizations, public organizations, and private nonprofit organizations for activities that encourage individuals to wear approved equestrian helmets.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the effectiveness of such grants.\n\nEstablishes an interim standard for equestrian helmets manufactured nine months after enactment of this Act pending establishment of a final standard.\n\nDirects the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to begin rulemaking proceedings for development of a final standard. Excludes such proceedings from specified laws governing the CPSC's reliance on voluntary standards, the development of consumer product safety rules, and the CPSC's regulation of consumer products in accordance with other laws. Prohibits application of judicial review provisions to any standard issued pursuant to such proceedings.\n\nRequires any failure to meet the interim standard to be treated as a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). Requires any final standard to be considered a CPSA consumer product safety standard."
