    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on December 16, 2005. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nElectronic Duck Stamp Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with state management agencies, to conduct a three-year pilot program under which up to 15 states may issue electronic migratory bird hunting and conservation stamps.\n\nProhibits a state's participation in the program unless the Secretary approves an application which includes: (1) a description of the format of the electronic stamp to be issued and any fee to be charged for it; and (2) procedures for transmitting electronic stamp customer data to the Secretary and for delivery of such stamps. Requires the Secretary to publish eligibility requirements and selection criteria.\n\nDirects the Secretary to require participating states to: (1) provide an actual (paper) stamp to each individual to whom the state sells an electronic stamp by the date on which the electronic stamp expires; and (2) collect and transmit to the Secretary electronic stamp revenue and customer information.\n\nAllows states to charge a reasonable fee to cover program costs and to issue duplicate electronic stamps for lost or damaged stamps. Prohibits states from requiring a state hunting license as a condition of issuing an electronic stamp.\n\nSets forth standards for the issuance and recognition of electronic stamps.\n\nAuthorizes termination of a state's participation in the program by the Secretary for violating the terms of its application or by a state upon providing written notice to the Secretary.\n\nDirects the Secretary, in consultation with state fish and wildlife management agencies and stakeholders with expertise in the electronic duck stamp program, to evaluate and report to Congress on the pilot program.\n\nRevises and makes technical amendments to provisions popularly known as the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act (or Duck Stamp Act of 1934), including: (1) reassigning authority for issuing stamps from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior; (2) incorporating current administrative practices for issuing stamps; and (3) establishing as the short title for such provisions the \"Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act.\""
