    "text": "Privacy Act of 2005 - Prohibits the sale and disclosure of personally identifiable information by a commercial entity to a non-affiliated third party unless prescribed procedures for notice and opportunity to restrict such disclosure have been followed. Grants the Federal Trade Commission enforcement authority.\n\nAmends Federal criminal law to prohibit the display, sale, or purchase of social security numbers (SSNs) without the affirmatively expressed consent of the individual. Exempts certain public records containing SSNs from such prohibition, but extends it to the display, sale, or purchase of SSNs within specified public records.\n\nAmends Title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to prohibit the use of SSNs on: (1) checks issued for payment by governmental agencies; and (2) driver's licenses or motor vehicle registrations. Prohibits a commercial entity from requiring disclosure of an individual's SSN in order to obtain goods or services. Establishes criminal and civil monetary penalties for misuse of an SSN.\n\nAmends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to make conforming limitations upon financial industry sale and sharing of non-public personal financial information. Sets forth prohibitions against the selling or marketing of protected health information by specified entities.\n\nAmends the Driver's Privacy Protection Act relating to proscriptions against release and use of certain personal information from State motor vehicle records to expand the definition of such personal information, and to include highly restricted personal information (such as an individual's photograph or any physical copy of a driver's license) among such proscriptions.\n\nEmpowers State Attorneys General to enforce this Act. Establishes Federal injunctive authority regarding any violation of this Act."
