(Exempts from such restriction ships or tankers involved in an internationally-recognized demobilization program or the shipment of non-lethal assistance necessary to carry the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan.)\n\nProhibits, with waiver authority, U.S. assistance to a country in violation of U.N.
