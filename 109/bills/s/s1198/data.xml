  <summary date="2005-06-24T19:05:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2005 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize states to enact laws restricting the receipt and disposal of foreign municipal solid waste within their borders until the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates regulations implementing and enforcing the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste between the United States and Canada (Agreement).

Defines the authority of the Administrator with respect to the importation and exportation of municipal solid waste under the Agreement. Requires the Administrator to give substantial weight to the views of affected states and local governments before consenting to the importation of foreign municipal solid waste into the United States under the Agreement, and to consider the impact of such importation on: (1) the continued public support for state and local recyling programs; (2) landfill capacities; (3) air emissions and road deterioration from increased vehicular traffic; and (4) homeland security, public health, and the environment.

Authorizes the Administrator to assess civil penalties for any past or current violations of this Act or to commence a civil action in the U.S. district court.</summary>
