    "text": "AGOA Extension Act of 2006 - Amends the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) to change from mandatory to discretionary the authority of the President to terminate the designation of an eligible beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for trade benefits for failure to comply with such Act's requirements. Requires the President to notify Congress of the proposed termination and allows the termination only if Congress fails to prohibit it.\n\nRevises provisions providing for preferential trade treatment of certain textiles, apparel, and agricultural products.\n\nDirects the President to develop a comprehensive plan addressing critical sub-Saharan African agricultural policy issues.\n\nAmends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to direct the Export-Import Bank of the United States to ensure that full consideration is given to the extent to which any loan or other assistance is likely to have a positive effect on industries in countries designated as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nRequires seeking negotiations for tax treaties and bilateral investment treaties benefiting sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nRequires infrastructure and industry-building assistance to sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress regarding: (1) the October 2005 election of Ms. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as President of Liberia; and (2) U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) technical assistance to sub-Saharan African countries in developing domestic tax policies, revenue administration, and anti-corruption efforts, as well as policies to replace lost trade tax revenues resulting from trade liberalization."
