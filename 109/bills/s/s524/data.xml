  <summary date="2005-03-29T16:19:35Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Federal criminal code to define "passport," for purposes of provisions concerning forgery, false use, or misuse of passports, to mean any passport issued by the United States or any foreign country.

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) add to the definition of "aggravated felony" false statements in passport applications and misuse of passports; and (2) incorporate into the definition certain existing offenses relating to passport fraud regardless of the term of imprisonment imposed.

Requires a detention hearing for such offenses upon the Government's motion.</summary>
