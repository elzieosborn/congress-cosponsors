  <summary date="2006-02-23T19:46:57Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Digital Age Communications Act of 2005 - Makes it unlawful for any provider of electronic communications service to participate in unfair methods of competition, or unfair or deceptive practices, in or affecting electronic communications networks and services.

Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from denying an application to assign or transfer control of a communications license, permit, or certificate unless it is in violation of the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) or a specific FCC rule or regulation.

Repeals the Act's application to universal service three years after the enactment of this Act.

Authorizes the Federal-State Joint Board on universal service to periodically recommend to the FCC modifications as to which basic electronic communications services are to be supported by federal universal service support mechanisms. Directs the FCC to: (1) promulgate rules to reform the universal services contribution mechanism and adopt a new mechanism; and (2) revise its current universal service fund system to establish a single universal service fund which shall be the exclusive federal universal service support mechanism.

States that it shall be U.S. policy: (1) to integrate federal, state, and local regulation of electronic communications networks; (2) that such networks and their services be governed by a single, minimally pervasive regulatory regime; (3) to eliminate rate regulation and rate-setting when feasible; and (4) to create incentives to invest in new technologies and to encourage the deployment of advanced electronic communications services.

Authorizes continued state regulation of rates for basic stand-alone local service.</summary>
