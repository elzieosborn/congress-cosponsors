  <summary date="2006-07-25T19:39:38Z" status="Introduced in Senate">National Uniformity for Food Act of 2006 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to prohibit any state or political subdivision from establishing or continuing in effect for any food in interstate commerce any requirement that is not identical to specified FFDCA provisions (that would result in materially different requirements), including those related to adulterated foods, unsafe food additives, new animal drugs, and warnings concerning food safety. Allows state enforcement of identical provisions unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services has determined that such state provisions should not be enforced.

Allows a state to petition for an exemption or to establish a national standard regarding any requirement under FFDCA or the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act relating to food regulation. Allows the Secretary to provide such an exemption if the requirement: (1) protects an important public interest that would otherwise be unprotected; (2) would not cause any food to be in violation of any federal law; and (3) would not unduly burden interstate commerce.

Allows a state to establish a requirement that would otherwise violate FFDCA provisions relating to national uniform nutrition labeling or this Act if the requirement is needed to address an imminent hazard to health that is likely to result in serious adverse health consequences and if other requirements are met. Declares that this Act does not preempt certain state and local laws relating to labeling or a consumer advisory relating to food sanitation imposed on a food establishment or recommended by the Secretary. Declares that the Act takes effect only if the Secretary certifies to Congress that implementation will pose no additional risk to the public health or safety from terrorist acts relating to the food supply.</summary>
