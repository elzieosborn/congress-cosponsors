Requires grant applicants to: (1) be either nonprofits or local governmental entities; (2) define the program's service region; (3) have the capacity to carry out administrative functions associated with managing health plans; and (4) have demonstrated community involvement. Requires programs to pay for the costs of services through monthly premiums, divided among employee, employer, and grant funds according to specified percentages. Sets forth minimal coverage requirements for three-share program eligibility.Requires the Administrator to develop a formula to determine which businesses qualify as distressed businesses for purposes of this Act."
