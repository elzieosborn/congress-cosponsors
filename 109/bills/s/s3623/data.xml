Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to support the development of coal-to-liquid manufacturing facilities and associated infrastructure on DOE and other federal lands, including military bases and military installations closed or realigned under the defense base closure and realignment.

Authorizes the Secretary to construct storage facilities: (1) in the vicinity of pipeline infrastructure and at least one military base; but (2) outside the boundaries of any state on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.

Authorizes the Secretary to acquire, place in storage, transport, or exchange coal-to-liquid products, not to exceed 20% of the total quantity of petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Authorizes appropriations for the Air Force Research Laboratory to continue support efforts to test, qualify, and procure synthetic fuels developed from coal for aviation jet use.
