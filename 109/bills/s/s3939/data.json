Requires the Secretary to establish guidelines for the review and approval of such curriculum and for such training.\n\nDirects the Secretary to require that information provided to patients in connection with the prescription of the drug include additional strongly worded warnings: (1) regarding the nature of life-threatening afebrile infections and instructions on how to recognize such infections; and (2) against all possible deviations from FDA-approved methods of administration.\n\nProhibits a physician from deviating from FDA-approved methods of administration of such a drug."
