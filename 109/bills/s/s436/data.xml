  <summary date="2005-03-24T22:01:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Directs the Secretary of Energy to assess the economic implications of the dependence of the State of Hawaii on oil as its principal source of energy, including: (1) the short- and long-term prospects for crude oil supply disruption and price volatility and potential impacts on the economy of Hawaii; (2) the economic relationship between oil-fired generation of electricity from residual fuel and refined petroleum products consumed for ground, marine, and air transportation; (3) the technical and economic feasibility of increasing the contribution of renewable energy resources for generation of electricity, on an island-by-island basis; (4) the technical and economic feasibility of using liquefied natural gas to displace residual fuel oil for electric generation; and (5) the technical and economic feasibility of using renewable energy sources (including hydrogen) for ground, marine, and air transportation energy applications to displace the use of refined petroleum products. Instructs the Secretary to report to Congress, detailing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations resulting from such assessment.</summary>
