Prescribes program parameters.

(Sec. 3) Establishes an Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping (Committee) comprising senior representatives from federal agencies with ocean and coastal mapping and surveying responsibilities, and chaired by the representative from the NOAA.

(Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator, in consultation with the Committee, to develop and submit to Congress a plan for an integrated ocean and coastal mapping initiative within NOAA that: (1) identifies all NOAA coastal and ocean mapping programs; (2) encourages the development of innovative coastal and ocean mapping technologies and applications through research and development (R&amp;D) cooperative agreements at joint institutes; and (3) documents available and developing technologies, best practices in data processing and distribution, and leveraging opportunities with other federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.

Prescribes plan requirements.

Authorizes the Administrator to operate up to three joint ocean and coastal mapping centers, including a joint hydrographic center, to serve as hydrographic centers of excellence and to conduct activities to implement this Act.

Directs the Administrator to continue developing a strategy for expanding contracting with private entities in fulfilling NOAA's mapping and charting responsibilities and to report such strategy to Congress.

(Sec. 5) Requires the Chairman of the Committee to report bi-annually to Congress on progress made in implementing the provisions of this Act.
