        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</b></p> <p>Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act or PRIDE Act - <b>Title I: TANF</b> - (Sec. 101) Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) to require State TANF plans to: (1) establish specific measurable performance objectives for pursuing TANF purposes; (2) describe any strategies and programs the State is using or plans to use to address employment retention and advancement, reduction of teen pregnancy, services for struggling and noncompliant families, and for clients with special problems, and program integration; and (3) describe any strategies and programs the State is undertaking to engage faith-based organizations in the delivery of services funded by TANF.</p> <p>(Sec. 102) Amends SSA title IV part A to reauthorize, revise, and extend State family assistance grants for FY 2006 through 2010 and make annual appropriations. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) Requires States to express in their State TANF plans how they would operate programs to encourage equitable treatment of healthy two-parent married families. Provides for healthy marriage promotion grants, replacing current bonuses to reward State decreases in illegitimacy ratio (hereby repealed). Directs the Secretary to develop and implement programs that are designed to address domestic violence. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 2005 through 2010. Requires such funds to remain available to the Secretary until expended. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) Reauthorizes and extends annual supplemental grants for population increases in certain States through FY 2009 and makes appropriations. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Replaces the high performance bonus with a bonus to reward employment achievement, and makes appropriations for FY 2006 through 2011. Requires the Secretary's formula for measuring State performance to measure absolute progress towards the goal of workplace attachment and advancement for families receiving assistance under TANF. Makes Indian tribes eligible for bonuses and directs the Secretary to consult with them in determining the criteria for awards for them and tribal organizations. </p> <p>(Sec. 106) Modifies contingency fund requirements. Eliminates a separately designated Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs. Makes appropriations for FY 2006 through 2010 for making contingency fund grants. Earmarks specified amounts for making payments to Indian tribes with approved tribal family assistance plans. Limits contingency fund grants to needy States, defined by specified criteria for economy-related increases in the number of families receiving assistance. Limits the total amount paid to a single State during a fiscal year to ten percent of the State family assistance grant. Eliminates the annual reconciliation process. Repeals the penalty for State failure to maintain 100 percent of historic effort.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) Revises requirements for the use of TANF grants. Repeals the authority of a State operating a TANF program to apply to an interstate immigrant family the rules (including benefit amounts) of the TANF program of another State if the family has moved to the State from the other State and has resided in the new State for less than 12 months.</p> <p>Restores authority of a State to transfer up to ten percent (currently 4.25 percent) of its TANF State family assistance grant for a fiscal year to carry out State programs pursuant to SSA title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services).</p> <p>Provides for an increase in social services block grant funds with respect to FY 2006 through 2010.</p> <p>Revises the current authorization for a State or tribe to reserve TANF block grant amounts for any fiscal year to provide TANF without fiscal year limitation. Permits a State or tribe to designate a portion of its TANF grant as a contingency reserve which may be used, without fiscal year limitation, to provide any benefit or service that may be provided under the State or tribal TANF program.</p> <p>Permits a State to use TANF grant funds to establish an undergraduate postsecondary or vocational education program. </p> <p>(Sec. 108) Repeals the Secretary's authority to make loans to State welfare programs.</p> <p>(Sec. 109) Revises mandatory work requirements. Eliminates the separate work participation rate for two-parent families beginning with FY 2003. Increases the all-family standard from the current 50 percent level to 55 percent for FY 2007, 60 percent for FY 2008, 65 percent for FY 2009, and 70 percent for FY 2010 and thereafter.</p> <p>Replaces the current caseload reduction credit with an employment credit, while giving States the option to phase-in the replacement. Limits the reduction of a State's required participation rate through the application of employment, caseload reduction, or other credits.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to conduct a Senator Blanche L. Lincoln Employment Study for a report to Congress on the implications of the design of the employment credit and potential improvements to it.</p> <p>Revises the State option for participation rate exemptions to give a State the option on a case-by-case basis to: (1) exclude a family from the determination of the State's monthly participation rate during their first month of TANF; or (2) not require a family with a child under age one to engage in work, and disregard such family in determining the State's minimum participation rate for not more than 12 months. </p> <p>Revises requirements for determining if a TANF recipient is engaged in work for a month. Provides for determination of countable hours engaged in work for a single parent or relative whose youngest child has attained age six, a single-parent or relative with a child under age six, two-parent families (as under current law), and two-parent families that receive federally funded child care.</p> <p>Expands the list of activities that may be counted towards meeting work participation requirements by a single parent or relative with a child over age six. Includes, subject to certain conditions, such activities as substance abuse counseling or treatment, and programs or activities designed to remove work barriers. Requires an average of 24 hours per week in participation in direct work activities.</p> <p>Modifies special rules to: (1) establish a general limitation of 30 percent for the number of individuals in all families in a State who may be treated as engaged in work by reason of participation in educational activities; and (2) give States the option of deeming a single parent caring for a child or adult dependent with a physical or mental impairment to be meeting all or part of a family's work participation requirements for a month. Provides for optional modification of work requirements for recipients residing in areas of Indian country or an Alaskan native village with high joblessness. Includes as work activities marriage education, marriage skills training, conflict resolution counseling in the context of marriage, and participation in programs that promote marriage. </p> <p> (Sec. 110) Eliminates the current State plan requirement for a parent or caretaker receiving TANF to engage in work. Replaces it with requirements for an adult or minor child head of household to engage in work or alternative self-sufficiency activities (as defined by the State), while no longer requiring that such work commence after 24 months of assistance, or once the State determines such an individual as ready to engage in work, whichever is earlier.</p> <p>Replaces individual responsibility plans with family self-sufficiency plans. </p> <p>Gives States the option to receive work participation rate credit for an individual whose plan specifies that they have a continuing need for rehabilitative services in order to engage in direct work activities. </p> <p>Requires a State receiving a TANF grant to: (1) monitor the participation of each adult recipient or minor child head of household in the activities specified in the self-sufficiency plan, and regularly review the family's progress toward self-sufficiency; and (2) revise the plan and the activities required under it, upon such a review, as the State deems appropriate in consultation with the family.</p> <p>Requires the State, before imposing a sanction against an adult recipient, minor child head of household, or a family for failure to comply with a requirement of the self-sufficiency plan or the State TANF program, to: (1) review the self-sufficiency plan; and (2) make a good faith effort to consult with the family. Applies family self-sufficiency requirements in the case of a family that includes an adult or minor child head of household recipient of assistance who is subject to a partial sanction. Bases the penalty for failure to comply with such requirements on the severity of failure.
