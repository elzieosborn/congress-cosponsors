  <summary date="2005-11-16T17:12:34Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to enlarge the scope of P-1 (athletes and entertainers) nonimmigrant visas to include: (1) a professional athlete; (2) a person who performs as an athlete, coach, or part of a team that is located in the United States and is a member of certain amateur foreign leagues or associations from which a significant number of individuals are drafted by major sports leagues or their minor league affiliates; and (2) a professional or amateur athlete who performs individually or as part of a group in a theatrical ice skating production coming to the United States in a specific ice skating production or tour. (Currently such provision is limited to athletes performing at an "internationally recognized level of performance.")

Eliminates consultation requirements applicable to the Secretary of Homeland Security's approval of such visas.

Requires the Secretary to permit a petition to seek P-1 classification for multiple alien athletes. Prohibits additional fees for such petitions.

Requires the Secretary to allow athletes or their employers to seek admission for such athletes under other than P-1 provisions of the Act.</summary>
