  <summary date="2005-03-28T19:43:24Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Equal Access Act to include coverage of public elementary schools. (The Act currently prohibits public secondary schools, if they receive Federal funds and if they offer a limited public forum, from denying equal access or a fair opportunity to, or discriminating against, any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the speech at such meetings.)</summary>
