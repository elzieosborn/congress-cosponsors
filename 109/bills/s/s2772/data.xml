  <summary date="2006-06-12T18:21:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Health Partnership Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a State Health Innovation Commission. Requires the Commission to: (1) provide states with reform options for state health care expansion and improvement programs; (2) establish minimum performance measures and goals with respect to coverage, quality, and cost of state programs; (3) review state applications and determine whether to submit a state proposal to Congress; and (4) submit to Congress a list of state applications that the Commission recommends for approval. Deems such proposals to be approved unless a joint resolution has been enacted disapproving such proposal. Sets forth rules for congressional consideration of such proposals.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide a grant to a state that has an application approved to enable such state to carry out an innovative state health program; (2) give priority to those state programs that the Commission determines have the greatest opportunity to succeed in providing expanded health insurance coverage and improving health access; and (3) link state allocations to the meeting of the goals and performance measures established under this Act.

Prohibits states from: (1) failing to maintain the same level of expenditures for health care coverage; (2) changing eligibility criteria for state medical assistance programs; or (3) permitting the imposition of any preexisting condition exclusion for covered benefits, with exceptions.</summary>
