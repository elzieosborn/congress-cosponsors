    "text": "Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Amendments of 2005 - Title I: Amendments to the Act of December 22, 1974 - (Sec. 101) Amends the Act of December 22, 1974 to repeal authority and requirements for appointment of Navajo and Hopi relocation negotiating teams, a Mediator, and related matters (because all such requirements have been fulfilled).\n\n(Sec. 106) Revises requirements for the partition of the Navajo and Hopi Joint Use Area of the 1882 Reservation established by Executive Order on December 16, 1882.\n\n(Sec. 107) Revises requirements for the exchange of land, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, between the United States (under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management in Arizona and New Mexico) and the Navajo Tribe. (Currently, the Secretary is required to make such a land exchange.)\n\nTerminates on September 30, 2008, the authority of the Commissioner of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) to select lands to be transferred to or acquired by the Navajo Tribe.\n\nAuthorizes the Commissioner, in order to facilitate relocation of a member of a Tribe, to grant a homesite lease on land acquired under such Act to a member of the extended family of a Navajo Indian eligible to receive benefits under such Act. Prohibits the Commissioner, however, from using any available funds to provide housing to such an extended family member.\n\n(Sec. 108) Terminates ONHIR on September 30, 2008, and transfers all remaining duties to the Secretary.\n\nEstablishes in the Department of the Interior an Office of Relocation to replace ONHIR.\n\n(Sec. 110) Prohibits any payment of benefits under the Act to any head of household not certified eligible to receive payments by September 30, 2005.\n\n(Sec. 111) Directs the Commissioner to notify the Secretary by September 30, 2008, of any head of household who: (1) is certified eligible to receive benefits; (2) does not reside on land partitioned to the Tribe of which the head of household is a member; and (3) has not received a replacement home. Directs the Commissioner also, by September 30, 2008, to transfer to the Secretary any funds not used to make payments to eligible heads of households. Requires the Secretary to hold such funds in trust for the benefit of each eligible head of household who has not received a replacement home until he or she (or an heir) requests the funds for the acquisition of such a home.\n\nRequires the Commissioner, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, to notify each eligible head of household who has not entered into a lease with the Hopi Tribe to reside on land partitioned to the Tribe. Authorizes the Commissioner to begin construction of a replacement home on acquired land within 90 days after receiving notice of the imminent removal of a relocatee from land provided to the Hopi Tribe.\n\n Requires the Commissioner to establish an expedited procedure for reaching a final determination on appeals of eligibility denials. Authorizes appeal of an eligibility denial to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n(Sec. 121) Authorizes appropriations to carry out the relocation program for FY2006-FY2008.\n\nTitle II: Personnel of The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation - (Sec. 201) Amends federal civil service law to provide that retention preference requirements shall not apply to an ONHIR employee.\n\n(Sec. 202) Amends federal civil service law to direct the ONHIR Commissioner to establish a program to offer separation pay to ONHIR employees in the same manner as the Secretary of Defense offers separation pay to employees of a defense agency.\n\n(Sec. 203) Modifies the retirement computation formula for ONHIR employees eligible for early or optional retirement.\n\nTitle III: Transfer of Functions And Savings Provisions - (Sec. 302) Transfers to the Secretary any ONHIR function that has not been carried out by ONHIR on the enactment of this Act.\n\n(Sec. 303) Provides for the transfer and allocations of appropriations."
