    "text": "Small Business Drought Relief Act of 2005 - Amends the Small Business Act to include within the definition of \"disaster,\" for purposes of disaster loans provided to small businesses through the Small Business Administration (SBA), droughts and below average water levels in the Great Lakes or any other U.S. body of water that supports commerce by small businesses. Authorizes such loan assistance for farm- and nonfarm-related small businesses affected by droughts. Limits the amount that may be used during each of FY2005-FY2008 to provide drought disaster loans to non-farm related concerns. Requires the SBA to respond in writing to a State Governor regarding its determination concerning the provision of disaster loan assistance within 30 days after receiving such Governor's certification that small businesses in that State have suffered economic injury as a result of a disaster."
