Provides that licenses shall be issued for: (1) supplying medical products to countries with low-income or lower-middle income economies; or (2) conducting neglected research anywhere, royalty-free. Provides that such licenses shall be part of the institution's title in a subject invention. Makes a license under this Act irrevocable and perpetual so long as the licensee submits to the licensor payment of a fair royalty on sales of any medical product within 90 days.

Deems a party as automatically receiving the license requested upon submitting the required information to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sets forth procedures for objections to the grant of a requested license.
