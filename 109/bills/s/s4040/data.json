Provides that such licenses shall be part of the institution's title in a subject invention. Makes a license under this Act irrevocable and perpetual so long as the licensee submits to the licensor payment of a fair royalty on sales of any medical product within 90 days.\n\nDeems a party as automatically receiving the license requested upon submitting the required information to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sets forth procedures for objections to the grant of a requested license.\n\nRequires the holder of title or any license in a subject invention to notify the FDA of any grant or license of rights in that invention."
