  <summary date="2006-10-16T18:54:53Z" status="Introduced in Senate">National Reportable Conditions Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the Commission on National Reportable Conditions to review state and local regulations to determine the existence of conditions that represent a serious threat to the health of individuals in the United States, compile a list of national reportable conditions to be recommended for certifications, and advise the Secretary.

 Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, based upon the Commission's recommendations, to: (1) annually certify a list of national reportable conditions (i.e., diseases, conditions, and events that when identified by health practitioners, veterinarians, animal and food production specialists, state and local health professionals, environmental and public utility workers, and laboratory workers must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)); (2) establish an electronic National Reportable Conditions System, a data repository of records processed by the System, a process to enable commercial entities to transmit reports to a single government entity, and a process for the identification of obstacles or challenges to the achievement of the purposes of this Act (including a research program to identify or create solutions); and (3) award grants to state and local entities to enable them to conduct surveillance and timely reporting activities regarding the submission of reports.

 Requires the Secretary to establish a process that permits the simultaneous submission of reports to a state or local jurisdiction to achieve compliance with a state or local law.</summary>
