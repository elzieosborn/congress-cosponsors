Security Council to: (1) address exploitation at the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC); (2) conclude a Memorandum of Understanding relating to binding codes of conduct and programs for the prevention of sexual abuse and trafficking in persons to be undertaken by the United Nations for all countries that contribute troops to MONUC; (3) strengthen MONUC; (4) ensure that the recruiting and arming of children in the DRC is halted; (5) strengthen the arms embargo; (6) allow for more effective protection of natural resources in the DRC, especially in the eastern part of the country; (7) press countries in the Congo region to help facilitate an end to the violence in the DRC; and (8) encourage the U.N. Secretary-General to become more involved in completing the policy objectives and ensure that fighting in North Kivu, Ituri, and other areas does not create widespread instability throughout the country.\n\n(Sec. 202) States that the President should use U.S. influence to support increased international humanitarian and development assistance for the DRC.\n\nStates that if the Secretary determines that the government of the DRC is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives the President shall consider withdrawing U.S. support for such international assistance when future funding decisions are considered."
