Byrd Honors Scholarship Program for higher education.\n\nAmends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to direct the Secretary of Labor to extend the hours and periods of permissible employment of employees between the ages of 14 and 16 years who are privately educated at a home school, whether the home school is treated as a home school or a private school under state law, beyond those hours and periods applicable to employees of such ages who are educated in traditional public schools. (Thus allows home-school students to be employed during the traditional school day.)\n\nAmends specified federal law with respect to policies on recruitment and enlistment of home schooled students in the Armed Forces."
