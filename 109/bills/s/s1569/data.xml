  <summary date="2006-01-18T15:43:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">State Long-Term Care Partnership Act of 2005 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide for establishment of long-term care insurance partnerships between states and insurers (Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnerships (QSLTCIPs)). Defines a QSLTCIP as a state plan amendment that provides for the disregard of any assets or resources in an amount equal to the insurance benefits payments made under a long-term care insurance policy (including a certificate issued under a group insurance contract), but only if the policy meets certain requirements, including coverage of an insured who, at the time coverage first becomes effective, is a resident of such state or of a state that maintains a QSLTCIP.

Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for educating consumers regarding QSLTCIPs and long-term care insurance policies issued in connection with them.</summary>
