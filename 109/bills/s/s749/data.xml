  <summary date="2005-04-25T18:51:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to require an executive agency, when procuring Federal Prison Industries (FPI) products or services, to: (1) use competitive procedures; or (2) make an individual purchase under a multiple award contract in accordance with applicable competition requirements. Requires an agency to: (1) timely notify FPI of procurements; (2) consider a timely offer from FPI in the same manner as other offers; and (3) consider a timely offer from FPI without limitation as to the dollar value, unless competition is limited to small business concerns. Outlines exceptions to the competitive procedures requirement. Prohibits requiring a contractor to use FPI as a subcontractor or supplier. Prohibits access to classified and sensitive information by an inmate worker. Restricts the interstate and foreign commerce of services resulting from convict labor. Subjects knowing violators of such restrictions to fine or imprisonment, or both. Requires Federal, State, and local prison work programs to meet specified requirements. Allows FPI to sell or donate a product or service to tax-exempt charitable organizations which may then donate or sell any such product or service to low-income individuals. Establishes the Enhanced In-Prison Educational and Vocational Assessment and Training Program within the FPI. Directs FPI to increase inmate employment by producing products for the public sector that would otherwise be produced outside the United States. Authorizes priority placement in the Bureau of Prisons for FPI employees displaced because FPI loses business following enactment.</summary>
