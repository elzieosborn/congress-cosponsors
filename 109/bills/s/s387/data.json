    "text": "Climate Change Technology Tax Incentives Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) a tax credit for investment in a greenhouse gas intensity reduction project; (2) a business tax credit for production from a qualifying clean coal technology unit; (3) a tax credit for investment in qualifying advanced clean coal technology; (4) a business tax credit for production from a qualifying advanced clean coal technology unit; and (5) a business tax credit for production from advanced nuclear power facilities. Permits the transfer of unused credit amounts by certain organizations, including tax-exempt organizations, public utilities, States, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Terminates all tax credits proposed by this Act after 2010.\n\nExpresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the tax credit for electricity produced from certain renewable resources should be extended through 2010; and (2) the tax credit for increasing research activities should be increased and made permanent."
