  <summary date="2006-07-05T19:21:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Website for American Taxpayers to Check and Help Deter Out-of-control Government Spending Act or WATCHDOGS Act - Defines: (1) a "contractor entity" as any entity that receives federal funds as a general contractor or subcontractor at any tier in connection with a federal contract; and (2) "covered entity" as any entity that receives federal funds through a grant or loan, with exceptions. Requires each contractor entity and covered entity to: (1) apply to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a federal funds application number; and (2) annually provide OMB with specified information.

Directs OMB to: (1) issue a federal funds application number to each covered entity or contractor entity that applies for such number; (2) develop and establish a publicly accessible searchable database website of information on each covered entity and contractor entity; (3) promulgate regulations to designate, as specified, loan programs not covered by this Act; and (4) provide for information disclosure exemptions in the interest of national defense or national security.

Requires each federal agency to: (1) use the federal funds application number with respect to any document relating to a covered entity or contractor entity receiving federal funds; and (2) make such information relating to covered entities or contractor entities available to OMB as OMB may require.</summary>
