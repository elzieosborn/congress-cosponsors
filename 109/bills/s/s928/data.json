Defines \"carryover business interests\" and revises ownership requirements and material participation rules applicable to such interests.\n\nProvides that carryover business interests acquired from a decedent shall be treated as transferred by gift and that the basis of such property shall be the lesser of the adjusted basis of the decedent, or the fair market value of such property at the date of the decedent's death (thus eliminating the estate tax on such property)."
