Provides that, upon the approval by a constitutional convention in the Commonwealth of a self-determination option, the convention shall submit a self-determination proposal to Congress for approval.

Requires submission of the proposal, upon approval by Congress with or without modifications, to the people of the Commonwealth for approval or rejection in a referendum.

Requires enactment of a joint resolution of Congress approving the terms of the proposal, including implementing provisions, if the people of Puerto Rico approve the proposal in the referendum.

Provides that, if a self-determination proposal is not approved by Congress or by the people of Puerto Rico in a referendum, the Government of the Commonwealth should call for a new constitutional convention, including an election by the people of Puerto Rico of new delegates to the convention, for the purpose of formulating and submitting to Congress a new self-determination proposal.</summary>
