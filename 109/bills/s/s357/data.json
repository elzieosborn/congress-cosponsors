Limits a part B grant award's duration to not more than five years. Prohibits the Secretary of Education from awarding more than one part B grant to an HSI in any one fiscal year.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for: (1) the current part A program of grants to HSIs that offer baccalaureate degrees or are junior or community colleges; and (2) the new part B program of grants to HSIs that offer postbaccalaureate certifications or degrees.\n\nEliminates the requirement that an eligible HSI provide assurances that at least 50 percent of its Hispanic students are low-income students.\n\nIncludes, among authorized activities under part A grants, articulation agreements and student support programs to help transfers from two-year to four-year institutions.\n\nEliminates the two-year wait-out period between any two five-year part A grants to an HSI."
