Lists terms and conditions for such a lease (master lease), including that it: (1) have as its primary purpose enhancing the value of the Center; (2) be negotiated pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator considers necessary to ensure the integrity of the selection process and to protect U.S. interests; (3) be for a term not to exceed 50 years; and (4) provide that all development risk remain with the nonfederal entity. Directs that a master lease be for fair consideration.

Authorizes the Administrator to retain from the proceeds of a master lease amounts necessary to recover the expenses incurred by the Administrator with respect to such lease.</summary>
