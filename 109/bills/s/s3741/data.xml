  <summary date="2006-11-29T18:48:18Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Authorizes the Secretary of State, upon a determination that additional funding for the Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service account (Account) is necessary as a result of the extraordinary costs of facilitating the evacuation of persons from Lebanon on or after July 16, 2006, to transfer to the Account from unobligated amounts in any Administration of Foreign Affairs account necessary sums to: (1) cover the costs of such evacuations; and (2) replenish the Account to the July 15, 2006, funding level.

States that transferred amounts shall be merged with Account amounts, and shall be available for the same purposes and subject to the same conditions as Account amounts.

Directs the Secretary to notify the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives at least five days prior to any proposed transfer. Authorizes the Secretary to waive such requirement if exigent circumstances exist, but requires the Secretary to notify the Committees no later than three days after such transfer.

Authorizes specified funds to be made available for such evacuation costs.</summary>
