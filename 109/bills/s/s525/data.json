(Sec. 102) Authorizes appropriations to carry out CCDBGA for FY2006-FY2010. (Sec. 103) Revises CCDBGA requirements for: (1) state plans, with respect to lead agencies, consumer and child care provider education information, use of block grant funds for child care resource and referral systems, direct services, and payment rates; (2) activities to improve the quality of child care, to include early learning and school preparedness standards; (3) optional priority use of additional funds; (4) reports and audits; (5) national activities; and (6) a child's eligibility based on a state-determined income level, with priority based on state-defined need. (Sec. 109) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reserve specified amounts for: (1) annual grants to improve child care quality and access; and (2) a toll-free hotline.(Sec. 111) Declares that nothing in CCDBGA shall be construed to require a state to impose state child care licensing requirements on any type of early child care provider. Title II: Enhancing Security at Child Care Centers in Federal Facilities - (Sec. 202) Directs the following federal officials to issue regulations concerning matters relating to occupant emergency plans, evacuations, and relocation sites for their respective child care facilities: (1) the Administrator of General Services, for executive facilities; (2) specified officers of the House and Senate, and the Librarian of Congress, for legislative facilities; and (3) the Director of the Office of the U.S. Courts, for judicial facilities. Title III: Removal of Barriers to Increasing the Supply of Quality Child Care - (Sec. 301) Directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a demonstration program of competitive three-year grants to states, and to Indian tribes and tribal organizations, to help them provide funds to encourage the establishment and operation of small business employer-operated child care programs. Requires a state to give priority for such assistance to applicants that desire to form a consortium to provide child care in a geographic area within the state where such care is not generally available or accessible. Requires such a consortium to include at least one small business, and allows it to include other small businesses, nonprofit agencies or organizations, local governments, or other appropriate entities. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY2006-FY2010. Terminates the program at the end of FY2010."
