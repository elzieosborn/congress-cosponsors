Establishes the National Invasive Species Council (NISC) as an independent entity in the executive branch to lead and coordinate efforts to minimize the negative effects caused by invasive species and to reduce the threat of further invasions of such species. Requires NISC to develop a National Invasive Species Management Plan and to establish an Invasive Species Advisory Committee.
