Deems such petition to be denied if no determination has been made on the petition within 30 days of filing. Establishes the fee for filing such a petition.\n\nApplies this section to any application for patent term extension which: (1) is pending on the date of enactment; (2) is the subject of a request for reconsideration of a denial of a patent term extension; or (3) has been denied a patent term extension in a case in which the period for seeking reconsideration of such denial has not yet expired."
