        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Veterans' Choice of Representation and Benefits Enhancement Act of 2006 - <b>Title I: Veterans' Representation </b>- (Sec. 101) Amends federal veterans' benefits provisions to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to prescribe: (1) qualifications and standards of conduct for agents and attorneys acting on behalf of veterans in claim proceedings before the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), including good moral character and appropriate experience and training; and (2) restrictions on fees collected for such services. Authorizes the Secretary to collect a registration fee from recognized agents and attorneys. Directs the Secretary to prescribe the amount and frequency of collection of such fees. </p> <p>Provides as an additional basis for the suspension of agents and attorneys the presentation of frivolous claims, issues, or arguments to the VA.</p> <p>Repeals a provision prohibiting a veteran claimant from hiring an attorney during the VA administrative process. Revises the time period during which attorney fee agreements may be filed with the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Allows the Secretary to review such an agreement, and order a fee reduction if the Secretary finds the fee excessive or unreasonable.</p> <p><b>Title II: Memorial Affairs </b>- (Sec. 201) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to tribal organizations for establishing, expanding, or improving veterans' cemeteries on trust lands owned by, or held in trust for, such organization.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary of the Army to remove the remains of Russell Wayne Wagner from Arlington National Cemetery, and to notify next-of-kin.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) Amends the Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 to provide the VA grave marker benefit to veterans dying on or after November 1, 1990 (currently September 11, 2001). Makes permanent (currently terminates December 31, 2006) the authority to provide such markers. Authorizes the provision of headstones (currently, only markers). Allows for the placing of a headstone or marker as close as possible to the grave when its placing on the grave itself is impossible or impracticable.</p> <p><b>Title III: Education Matters </b>- (Sec. 301) Expands the programs of education eligible for the accelerated payment of educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill for veterans with at least three years of active-duty service to include an approved program of education lasting less than two years that leads to employment in the transportation, construction, hospitality, or energy sectors.
