Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) adopt minimal technical and device rules to develop the use of such spectrum by such unlicensed devices; and (2) establish specified rules and procedures, including to protect incumbent licensed services from harmful interference from such unlicensed devices, and to address complaints from licensed broadcast stations that an unlicensed device using such spectrum causes harmful interference.</summary>
