Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005 - (Sec. 3) Directs the Federal Transit Administration of the Department of Transportation to submit all public transportation security assessments and all other relevant information to the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary).

Directs the Secretary to review, augment, and use them as the basis for allocating funds under security assistance grants, unless the Secretary notifies the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate that the Secretary has determined that an adjustment is necessary to respond to an urgent threat or significant factors.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) update such security assessments; (2) conduct them for all public transportation agencies considered to be at greatest risk of a terrorist attack; (3) use them and other relevant information to establish the process for developing public transportation security guidelines and designing a security improvement strategy; and (4) conduct assessments to determine the specific needs of local bus-only public transportation systems and selected public transportation systems that receive formula grants for non-urbanized areas.

(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to award grants directly to public transportation agencies for allowable capital and operational security improvements based on establlished priorities.

Requires each public transportation agency that receives a grant to: (1) identify a security improvements coordinator; and (2) develop a comprehensive plan for the agency's capacity for operating and maintaining the equipment purchased under this Act.

(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to: (1) ensure that the Department of Transportation receives appropriate and timely notification of all credible terrorist threats against public transportation assets in the United States; and (2) provide sufficient financial assistance for the reasonable costs of the Information Sharing and Analysis Center for Public Transportation (ISAC) established to protect critical infrastructure.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) require public transportation agencies at significant risk of terrorist attack to participate in ISAC; and (2) encourage all other public transportation agencies to participate in ISAC. Prohibits the Secretary from charging a fee to any public transportation agency for such participation.

(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to award grants to public or private entities to conduct research into, and demonstrate, technologies and methods to reduce and deter terrorist threats or mitigate damages resulting from terrorist attacks against public transportation systems.

Requires the return of misspent grant funds to the Treasury.

(Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations for: (1) the capital security assistance program and for research for FY2007; (2) the operational security assistance program for FY2007-FY2009; and (3) intelligence sharing, including ISAC (without fiscal year limit).</summary>
