    "text": "National Mathematics and Science Consistency Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to convene a panel to produce, for kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12), voluntary national expectations for science and mathematics education, sample assessment questions based on them, and a model mathematics and science curriculum. Requires such expectations to be based on core ideas in mathematics and science common to all states, and the model curriculum to be taken or adapted from effective state mathematics and science teaching materials. Requires the panel also to develop and coordinate professional development criteria that would prepare teachers to incorporate such expectations.\n\nRequires the Secretary to award competitive grants to states to: (1) develop instructional materials based on the voluntary national mathematics and science curriculum; (2) ensure that the infrastructure and technical assistance to provide such instructional materials online and free of charge to school personnel is available; and (3) train K-12 mathematics and science teachers to use the instructional materials and assessment questions in teaching."
