Authorizes appropriations to the: (1) Department of Commerce to provide, in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and Florida, bridge grants and loans to small businesses in areas which the President has designated as a disaster area as a result of Hurricane Katrina; and (2) SBA for entrepreneurial development for small businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina.

Directs the Administrator to: (1) provide an outreach and technical assistance program for affected small businesses; and (2) make supplemental emergency loans to affected small businesses.

Authorizes the making of loans to small businesses and farming operations that have or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury on or after January 1, 2005, as the result of a significant increase in energy costs.</summary>
