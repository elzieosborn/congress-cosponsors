Requires the permitted contributions to be used solely for responding to such advertisements, and funds remaining at the conclusion of such response to be returned to the individual contributors (based on the percentage of the total amount contributed).\n\nRequires the Senator to submit for review to the Select Committee on Ethics the amount raised, copies of the advertisements in question, and the dates and outlets on which the advertisements were run.\n\nExempts any authorized committee of a Senator who is a candidate for an office other than Senator, but only if such committee is established for running for such other office, and no contribution accepted by the committee is used for running for the office of Senator."
