    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nLong Island Sound Stewardship Act of 2005 - States as the purpose of this Act the establishment of the Long Island Sound Stewardship Initiative to identify, protect, and enhance sites within the Long Island Sound ecosystem with significant ecological, educational, open space, public access, or recreational value through a bi-state network of sites.\n\nEstablishes in the states of Connecticut and New York the Long Island Sound Stewardship Initiative Region. .\n\nEstablishes the Long Island Sound Stewardship Advisory Committee to evaluate applications for conservation easements, management plans, and grant funds relating to the Region.\n\nRequires the Committee to: (1) identify 20 initial Long Island Sound stewardship sites that are natural resource-based recreation areas or exemplary natural areas with ecological value and that best promote the purposes of this Act; and (2) use due diligence to recommend an equal distribution of funds between the states for the initial sites. Authorizes owners of sites to submit applications to the Committee to have sites identified as stewardship sites.\n\nDirects the Committee to: (1) use a specified process for identifying additional recreation and natural areas with potential as stewardship sites; and (2) publish in the Federal Register a list of sites that further the purposes of this Act after giving site owners prior notice of publication. Authorizes the Committee to deviate from its site identification process under certain circumstances.\n\nRequires the Committee to: (1) use an adaptive management framework to identify policy initiatives and actions; (2) submit annual reports to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for FY2006-FY2013; and (3) make recommendations to the Administrator on grants for stewardship sites. Requires the Administrator to review the Committee's recommendations and issue a report on the Initiative.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this Act requires private property owners to allow public access to their property, creates any liability of private property owners for individuals injured on their property, or requires owners of private property with the Region to participate in the Intuitive.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2013. Limits the federal share of the costs of certain activities under this Act to 75% of the total cost of the activity.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to reauthorize appropriations through FY2009 for: (1) the Office of Management Conference of the Long Island Sound Study; and (2) grants to implement the Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan.\n\nTerminates the Committee on December 31, 2013."
