(Thus makes LSTA grant-eligible tribal libraries also eligible for E-rate assistance to the same extent as other libraries receiving such assistance.)\n\nDirects the Secretary of Commerce to expand the American Community Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census to elicit information for residential households, including those located on native lands, as to what technology such households use to access the Internet from home."
