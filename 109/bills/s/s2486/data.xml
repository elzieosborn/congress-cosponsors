 Requires each such owner or operator to: (1) report to the Secretary with a vulnerability assessment and a prevention, preparedness, and response plan; (2) establish a safety and security committee for that source if it has 15 or more full-time equivalent employees; and (3) annually provide each employee with four hours of training regarding requirements of this Act.

Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a program to conduct regular inspections of stationary sources. Authorizes the Secretary to issue orders directing compliance with this Act and sets penalties for noncompliance.

Requires the Secretary and the Administrator to promulgate regulations requiring high priority stationary sources to participate in emergency preparedness exercises.
