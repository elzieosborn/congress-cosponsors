Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Improvement Act of 2005 - Amends the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act to apply to migratory bird species from Canada.

Increases (from 25 to 50 percent) the federal share of costs for funded projects. Prescribes forms of payment for projects undertaken in the United States and Canada and for projects undertaken in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Revises the reporting requirements under this Act to require the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) report to Congress not later than two years after the enactment of this Act; and (2) include a description of the activities of the advisory group convened by the Secretary.

Replaces provisions establishing the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund with provisions establishing the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer Account amounts to such Fund. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund through FY2010. Requires not less than 75 percent of such appropriations to be used for projects outside the United States.

Increases the amount of funds that the Secretary may expend to administer the Act.</summary>
