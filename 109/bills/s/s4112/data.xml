  <summary date="2006-12-29T19:58:30Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fallen Firefighters Assistance Tax Clarification Act of 2006 - Treats payments made before June 1, 2007, by a charitable organization by reason of the death, injury, wounding, or illness of any firefighter in the October 2006 Esperanza Incident in southern California as related to such organization&#146;s exempt function (and thus tax-exempt) if such payments are made in good faith using a reasonable and objective formula which is consistently applied. Protects private foundation making such payments from the penalty tax on self-dealing.

Excludes payments for firefighters made by charities or foundations under this Act (or by federal, state, or local governments) from the gross income of the recipient.</summary>
