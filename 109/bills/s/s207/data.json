Permits the acquisition of any private land in those Additions only with the owner's consent.\n\nSubjects any federal land in the CIT Tract Addition to any easements that have been agreed to by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Army.\n\nModifies and/or eliminates certain provisions related to the acquisition of property within the Unit.\n\nPermits hunting, fishing, and trapping within the Unit. (Current law excludes such activities within the core area of the Unit and on certain lands acquired by the Secretary within the Unit.) Continues to provide for the designation of zones where, and established periods when, no hunting, fishing, or trapping shall be permitted except for public safety reasons."
