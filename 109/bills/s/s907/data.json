Continues the cooperative research grant program.\n\n(Sec. 16) Eliminates the Industry Technical Panel.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to award: (1) demonstration grants to certain charitable or educational organizations or State or local government agency to provide transportation services to individuals to access dialysis treatments and other medical treatments for renal disease; and (2) grants to a national not-for-profit organization for the establishment of a national technical assistance center for senior transportation programs.\n\nDirects the Secretary to study and report to Congress on actions necessary to facilitate the purchase of increased volumes of alternative fuels for use in public transit vehicles.\n\n(Sec. 20) Repeals authority for the suspended light rail technology pilot project.\n\n(Sec. 22) Allows grants for new technology, including innovative or improved products, techniques, or methods, subject to certain requirements.\n\nMakes U.S. lands closed as a result of a military base closure available for transit purposes (including corridor preservation).\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to terminate capital investment assistance, and seek reimbursement, if the Secretary determines that an assistance recipient (State or local government or nonprofit organization) has made a false or fraudulent statement in connection with a federal transit program.\n\n(Sec. 23) Allows advance acquisition of real property for public transportation capital projects.\n\n(Sec. 24) Requires recipients of capital investment assistance to conduct all procurement transactions on a competitive basis.

Denies application to vehicles purchased with federal assistance of any state law requiring buses to be purchased through in-state dealers.\n\n(Sec. 25) Requires the project management plan of a recipient of capital investment assistance for a major capital project to provide, among other things, for safety and security management.\n\nIncreases from .5 % to 1% the amount of funds for certain capital projects (takedown) that the Secretary may use to make a contract to oversee the construction of such projects.\n\n(Sec. 26) Revises requirements for project review. Repeals the Program of Interrelated Projects (PIP).\n\n(Sec. 27) Authorizes the Secretary to investigate security risks, as well as safety hazards (as under current law), and require a local government to submit a plan for eliminating, mitigating, or correcting any security risks (as well as safety hazards) established by investigation. Permits the Secretary to determine any amount of assistance to be withheld until such a plan is approved and carried out.\n\nRequires the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Secretary of Homeland Security to define the respective roles of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Homeland Security with respect to public transportation security.\n\n(Sec. 28) Extends to states that are designing rail fixed guideway public transportation systems that will not be Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)-regulated (as well as, currently, those states already having such systems not subject to FRA regulation) certain requirements for the withholding of urbanized area formula grant amounts from states not in compliance with safety requirements.\n\nRequires several states subject to a single mass transportation authority to ensure uniform safety standards and enforcement. (Currently they merely have authority to designate an entity to ensure standards and enforcement.)\n\n(Sec. 29) Makes interference with a rail system controller a federal crime.\n\n(Sec. 30) Authorizes the Secretary to decide that a form of public transportation is covered adequately, for employee alcohol and controlled substances testing purposes, under pertinent law or regulations of an agency within DOT or other federal agency.

Requires the calculation of small transit intensive city factors in such apportionments. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of developing and implementing an incentive funding system for operators of public transportation.\n\n(Sec. 36) Authorizes FY2005 appropriations for formula grants for certain capital projects, job access and reverse commute grants for low income individuals, capital investment program grants, public transportation planning programs, public transportation research, university transportation research, and to carry out certain administrative provisions with respect to public transportation projects.
