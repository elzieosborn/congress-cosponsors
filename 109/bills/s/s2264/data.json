Authorizes a person whose CPNI has been obtained, used, or sold in violation of the requirements of this Act to file an action for civil relief against the violator in the appropriate court.\n\nAmends the Communications Act of 1934 to require telecommunications carriers to implement certain measures to protect a person's CPNI."
