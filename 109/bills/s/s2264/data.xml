Requires enforcement of the requirements of this Act by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the states. Authorizes a person whose CPNI has been obtained, used, or sold in violation of the requirements of this Act to file an action for civil relief against the violator in the appropriate court.

Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require telecommunications carriers to implement certain measures to protect a person's CPNI.</summary>
