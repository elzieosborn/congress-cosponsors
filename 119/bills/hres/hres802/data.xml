Under the resolution, a government shutdown occurs when there is a lapse in appropriations for any federal agency or department as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or a continuing resolution.

The resolution requires the House to convene on each day on which a government shutdown is in effect unless a recess or adjournment is permitted. Under the resolution, such a recess or adjournment is only permitted if&#160;

the House has met for each of the first five consecutive calendar days on which the government shutdown is in effect,the proposed period of adjournment or recess does not last for more than two consecutive calendar days, andthe House has met for at least five consecutive calendar days since the expiration of the most recent period of adjournment or recess.The resolution also requires the House to hold at least one recorded quorum call on each day that the House is in session during a government shutdown.&#160;

Members of the House who fail to record their presence during a quorum call on two or more consecutive days must be fined $500 for a first offense and $2,500 for any subsequent offense unless the failure is due to an illness. A Member may not use official or campaign funds to pay the fine.&#160;&#160;</summary>
