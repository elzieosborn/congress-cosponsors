  <summary date="2025-08-12T21:18:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution recognizes the goal of education in U.S. schools as that of ensuring that&#160;virtually every student achieves grade-level reading proficiency. It also encourages state and local governments, including educational agencies, to collaborate with private organizations that offer proven literacy programs to (1) identify and implement effective solutions to address illiteracy, and (2) create adult literacy initiatives for adults with reading skills below an 8th grade level.</summary>
