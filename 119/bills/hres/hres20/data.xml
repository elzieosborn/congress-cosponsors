  <summary date="2025-04-22T13:36:44Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution establishes&#160;the House Select Committee on Electoral Reform to examine current methods of electing Members of Congress, consider alternative&#160;methods of election, and report appropriate recommendations to Congress and the President.

Specifically, the committee must (1) determine how alternative methods of election would affect the responsiveness, accountability, and functionality of Congress; (2) conduct hearings to take testimony and receive evidence from appropriate expert witnesses; and (3) examine federal barriers to state experimentation with alternative electoral systems.&#160;The committee must consider alternatives to current methods that include&#160;adopting multi-member congressional districts with proportional representation;&#160;adjusting the total number of Members of the House of Representatives; adopting alternative methods of voting (e.g., ranked-choice voting); and holding open and nonpartisan primaries.

The committee shall be made up of 14 Members of Congress appointed by the Speaker of the House, 7 of whom shall be appointed in consultation with the minority leader. The committee's co-chairs shall be designated by the Speaker and minority leader, respectively.&#160;The resolution provides that the committee must hold its first meeting within 30 days after all of its members have been appointed.

The committee shall issue its final report to Congress and the President within one year after the committee's first meeting.</summary>
