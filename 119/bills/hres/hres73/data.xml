The resolution also condemns the Lukashenka regime's (1) repression of the Belarusian democratic opposition, (2) support for Russia's war against Ukraine, and (3) complicity in the forcible transfer of Ukrainian children from Ukraine.

The resolution supports additional sanctions against the regime and calls for continued support to the Belarusian democratic opposition. &#160;</summary>
