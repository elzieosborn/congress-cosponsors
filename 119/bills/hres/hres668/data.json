The committee may not withhold or redact\u00a0records on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\n\nThe resolution states support for the committee's subpoenas and investigatory actions and encourages timely compliance with them. Additionally, the committee shall issue investigative reports as it deems\u00a0necessary."
