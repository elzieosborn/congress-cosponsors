  <summary date="2025-05-13T14:16:42Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution provides for House consideration and amendment of H.R. 185.

The resolution provides for the adoption of a substitute amendment that establishes a budget point of order against considering budget reconciliation legislation in the House or the Senate that (1) reduces enrollment or benefits for individuals enrolled in the Medicaid program, or (2) reduces eligibility or benefits for households that participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

(Under current law, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)

The point of order expires on January 20, 2029.&#160;</summary>
