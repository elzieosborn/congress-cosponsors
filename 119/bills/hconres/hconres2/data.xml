  <summary date="2025-02-07T22:02:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Reclaiming Congress&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Constitutional Mandate in Trade Resolution

This concurrent resolution establishes a process for transferring the functions and responsibilities of the Office of the Trade Representative (USTR) from the executive branch to the legislative branch. The concurrent resolution establishes the Joint Ad Hoc Committee on Trade Responsibilities and the Congressional Advisory Board on Trade Responsibilities to plan for and implement the transfer.

The Joint Ad Hoc Committee on Trade Responsibilities shall consist of 14 members of Congress appointed by majority and minority party leaders of the two chambers of Congress&#160;and meeting qualifications specified in the bill. The committee shall develop a plan under which the functions and responsibilities of the USTR shall be moved and provide its plan in a report to Congress within 16 months after the committee is appointed.&#160;

The bill also establishes a 21-member Congressional Advisory Board on Trade Responsibilities responsible for advising the committee in its development of the plan. Individuals meeting qualifications specified in the bill shall be appointed by the Trade Representative and majority and minority party leaders.

The concurrent resolution also provides that the USTR shall provide such information and assistance the committee and the advisory board may reasonably require to carry out their activities.

The transition of the USTR to the legislative branch occurs four years after the committee submits its report.</summary>
