This bill expands Medicare coverage of diabetes outpatient self-management training.

Specifically, the bill specifies that in addition to physicians, other health care practitioners may also provide such services. It also specifies that coverage includes an initial 10 hours of training until used, as well as an additional 2 hours of training per year. The bill also prohibits the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services from limiting training that is deemed medically necessary.&#160;

Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must test a model in which such training is provided virtually and evaluate any effects on costs, services, and health outcomes.</summary>
