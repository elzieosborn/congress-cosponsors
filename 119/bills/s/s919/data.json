    "text": "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025 or the GENIUS Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes a regulatory framework for payment\u00a0stablecoins (digital assets which an issuer must redeem for a fixed value).\n\nUnder the bill, only permitted issuers may issue a payment stablecoin for use by U.S. persons, subject to certain exceptions. Permitted issuers must be a subsidiary of an insured depository institution, a federal-qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuer, or a state-qualified payment stablecoin issuer. Permitted issuers must be regulated by the appropriate federal or state\u00a0regulator. Permitted issuers may choose federal or state regulation; however, state regulation is\u00a0limited to those with\u00a0a\u00a0stablecoin issuance of $10 billion or less.\n\nPermitted issuers must maintain reserves backing the\u00a0stablecoin on a one-to-one basis using U.S. currency or other similarly liquid assets, as specified. Permitted issuers must also publicly disclose their redemption policy and publish monthly\u00a0the details of their reserves.\n\nThe bill specifies requirements for (1) reusing reserves; (2) providing safekeeping services for\u00a0stablecoins; and (3) supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority over federal-qualified issuers.\n\nThe bill allows foreign issuers to offer stablecoins in the United States if the issuer has the capability to comply with lawful orders. The Department of the Treasury must establish reciprocal agreements between the United States and similarly regulated jurisdictions.\n\nUnder the bill, permitted payment stablecoins are not considered securities under securities law. However, permitted issuers\u00a0are\u00a0subject to the Bank Secrecy Act for anti-money laundering and related purposes."
