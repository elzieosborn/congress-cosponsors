    "text": "Expanded Coverage for Former Foster Youth Act\n\nThis bill modifies provisions relating to the coverage of former foster youths under Medicaid.\n\nUnder current law, a state Medicaid program must cover former foster youths until the age of 26 if the youths were in a state's foster care system at the age of 18 and were enrolled in a state's Medicaid program while in foster care. The bill requires state Medicaid programs to also cover former foster youths who were placed in a legal guardianship with a kinship caregiver or were emancipated from foster care before the age of 18. The bill repeals the provision that requires former foster youths to have been enrolled in a state Medicaid program while in foster care in order to qualify for Medicaid coverage until the age of 26.\n\nThe bill also requires states to establish Medicaid outreach and enrollment programs for former foster youths."
