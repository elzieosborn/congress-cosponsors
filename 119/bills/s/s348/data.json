Under the bill, a covered country is (1) a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), (2) a country that has been designated as a major non-NATO ally under the Foreign Assistance Act of\u00a01961 (e.g., Australia, Israel, and Japan), or (3) a country that has in effect a free trade agreement with the United States.\n\nSpecifically, the President may proclaim a new or additional covered duty (e.g., a duty proclaimed pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962) on an article imported into the United States from a covered country only if (1) the President submits to Congress a request for authorization to proclaim or increase the duty and the request contains specified information, such as a description of the objective the President seeks to achieve with the\u00a0action and an assessment of the likely impact on the U.S. economy; and (2) a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law."
