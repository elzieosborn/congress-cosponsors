This authority does not apply to certain appointees or individuals in their probationary or trial period.\n\nSupervisors or managers who are subject to a removal, demotion, or suspension under this bill are entitled to (1) advance notice of the action and supporting evidence, (2) representation by an attorney or representative, and (3) grieve the action in accordance with an internal grievance process.\n\nThe bill also provides protections from removal, demotion, or suspension for supervisor or managers who are\u00a0whistleblowers or are seeking corrective action for an alleged prohibited personnel practice such as discrimination.\n\nThe bill also modifies the procedures to remove, demote, or suspend VA employees or senior executives based on performance or misconduct, specifically by requiring the VA to determine by substantial evidence that the performance or misconduct of the individual warrants such removal, demotion, or suspension. Such procedures must apply retroactively, beginning on the date of enactment of the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and\u00a0Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (June 23, 2017)."
