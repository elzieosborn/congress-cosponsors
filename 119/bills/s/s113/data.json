During this period, a financial institution may request to deviate from an approved business plan and the appropriate agency has 30 days to approve or deny the request.\n\nIn addition, the community bank leverage ratio\u00e2\u20ac\u201da way of evaluating debt levels\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis reduced for new rural community banks. Specifically, new rural community banks must have a ratio of 8%, with a three-year phase-in of the rate. After this period, the ratio rises to its current level of 9%.\u00a0\n\nFinally, the bill removes certain restrictions to allow federal savings associations to invest in, sell, or otherwise deal in agricultural loans."
