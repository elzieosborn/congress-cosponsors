Among other provisions, this settlement act authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to plan, design and construct the following two major projects on the Crow Reservation: (1) the rehabilitation and improvement of the Crow Irrigation Project (CIP); and (2) the planning, design, and construction of the MR&I System (the municipal, rural, and industrial water system of the Crow Reservation).\n\nAmong other provisions, the bill revises the settlement act to\n\nreplace references to the MR&I System with MR&I Projects;\u00a0establish a nontrust, interest-bearing account\u00a0(to be known as the Crow\u00a0CIP Implementation Account) to allow Reclamation to continue to work on the rehabilitation of the CIP;\u00a0create a new MR&I Projects Account, through which the tribe must use funds for activities related to water production, treatment, or delivery infrastructure; andextend by five years (to 2030) the period during which the tribe has the exclusive right to construct hydropower facilities on the Yellowtail\u00a0Afterbay Dam in Montana."
