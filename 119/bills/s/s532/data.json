    "text": "OPTN Fee Collection Authority Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), for three years, to collect registration fees directly from a member of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) (e.g., organ procurement organizations and\u00a0transplant hospitals) for each transplant candidate the member places on the waiting list.\n\n Registration fees for the OPTN were historically collected through a contractor. The bill authorizes\u00a0HRSA, for three years following the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enactment, to collect registration fees directly from OPTN members for each candidate they place on the list and distribute the fees to support the operation of the OPTN. HRSA must publish on the OPTN website the amount of fees collected from each member and their use.\n\nThe bill requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a review relating to the registration fees and report to Congress within two years after the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enactment.\n\nAdditionally, the bill supports (1) the integration of electronic health records systems into the OPTN, such as automated referrals and granting procurement organizations access to records of potential donors; and (2) the establishment of a dashboard to display statistics relating to the OPTN."
