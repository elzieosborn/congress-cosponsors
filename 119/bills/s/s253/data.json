Further, under current law, the calculation of the itemized tax deduction for medical and dental expenses may include amounts paid for a legal abortion.\n\nUnder the bill, amounts paid for an abortion may not be claimed as part of the itemized deduction for medical and dental expenses. However, under the bill, amounts paid for an abortion may be included in the itemized deduction for medical and dental expenses if (1) the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest; or (2) a woman is suffering from a physical disorder, injury, or illness (including a life-endangering\u00a0physical condition caused by or arising from\u00a0the pregnancy itself) that\u00a0would, as certified by a physician,\u00a0place the woman in danger of death if an abortion were not performed."
