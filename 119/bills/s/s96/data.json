    "text": "Fostering Autonomy in Independent Returns by Prohibiting Redundant and Extralegal Programs Act of 2025 or the FAIR PREP Act of 2025\n\nThis bill prohibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from preparing federal tax returns or refund claims, with some exceptions. The bill specifically prohibits the preparation of federal income tax returns or refund claims through the IRS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Direct File program. (The Direct File program currently allows qualified taxpayers in 25 participating states to prepare and electronically file free federal tax returns through a portal on the IRS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website.)\n\nThe bill defines prepare with respect to federal tax returns and refund claims as (1) the completion (in whole or in part) of any form or schedule for the purpose of calculating federal taxes or refunds, and (2) the filing (either electronically or on paper) of such federal tax returns or refund claims.\n\nHowever, under the bill, federal and state tax returns and refund claims may be prepared through the IRS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Free File program (a program that allows certain taxpayers to prepare and file free federal and state income tax returns\u00a0using third-party tax-preparation software) or the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance grant program (through which the IRS partners with local community organizations to help low-income and disabled individuals and persons with limited English proficiency prepare and file free federal and state\u00a0income tax returns).\n\n Further, the Department of the Treasury may not award grants or enter into contracts\u00a0or other transactions for the development or operation of an electronic tax preparation service.\u00a0\u00a0"
