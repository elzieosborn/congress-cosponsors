It also specifically covers services that are provided by respiratory therapists under Medicare and provides for an additional payment adjustment for these services.\n\nAdditionally, the bill (1) requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to develop an electronic template for providers to use when prescribing oxygen and related equipment, supplies, and services; and (2) establishes certain rights for beneficiaries receiving these items and services, such as the right to choose their suppliers and to receive clear communications and be informed about the services provided."
