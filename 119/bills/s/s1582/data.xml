  <summary date="2025-05-20T19:38:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act or the GENIUS Act

This bill establishes a regulatory framework for payment&#160;stablecoins (digital assets which an issuer must redeem for a fixed value).

Under the bill, only permitted issuers may issue a payment stablecoin for use by U.S. persons, subject to certain exceptions and safe harbors. Permitted issuers must be a subsidiary of an insured depository institution, a federal-qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuer, or a state-qualified payment stablecoin issuer. Permitted issuers must be regulated by the appropriate federal or state&#160;regulator. Permitted issuers may choose federal or state regulation; however, state regulation is&#160;limited to those with&#160;a&#160;stablecoin issuance of $10 billion or less.

Permitted issuers must maintain reserves backing the&#160;stablecoin on a one-to-one basis using U.S. currency or other similarly liquid assets, as specified. Permitted issuers must also publicly disclose their redemption policy and publish monthly&#160;the details of their reserves.

The bill specifies requirements for (1) reusing reserves; (2) providing safekeeping services for&#160;stablecoins; and (3) supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority over federal-qualified issuers.

The bill allows foreign issuers of stablecoins to offer, sell, or make available in the United States stablecoins using digital asset service providers, subject to requirements, including a determination by the&#160;Department of Treasury that they are subject to comparable foreign regulations.

Under the bill, permitted payment stablecoins are not considered securities under securities law. However, permitted issuers&#160;are&#160;subject to the Bank Secrecy Act for anti-money laundering and related purposes.</summary>
