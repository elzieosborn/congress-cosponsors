    "text": "Early Participation in Regulations Act of 2025\n\nThis bill directs agencies to publish an advance notice of a proposed rulemaking at least 90 days before publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking for a major rule. A major rule is a rule\u00a0that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) determines is likely to impose (1) an annual economic\u00a0effect of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, health, safety, the environment, or the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.\n\nThe advance notice must\n\ninclude a description of the problem the rule may\u00a0address, alternatives under consideration, and the legal authority for proposing the rule; andsolicit and provide at least 30 days for submission of written data, views, and argument from interested persons.Any difference between such advance notice and the notice of proposed rulemaking may not be considered arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u00a0for the purposes of review under\u00a0the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nAdvance notice is not required if the proposing agency is not required to publish notice of proposed rulemaking or OIRA finds that advance notice is (1) not in the public interest, (2) duplicative of a similar process, (3) not practicable due to a required deadline, or (4) for a rule that is routine or periodic in nature."
