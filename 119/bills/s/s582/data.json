(After returning to earth, astronauts generally undergo a post-mission medical recovery program and may be prohibited from driving motor vehicles for varying periods of time.)\u00a0\n\nUnder the bill, transportation may be provided to necessary post-mission activities including medical research and the monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of an astronaut or space flight participant before they receive post-mission clearance to operate a motor vehicle. Only astronauts employed by the U.S. government, certain international partner astronauts, and other individuals carried in launch or reentry vehicles are eligible for transportation.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also permits NASA to maintain, operate, and repair one or more passenger vehicles, including motor vehicles, aircraft, and other means of transportation, for the purpose of providing such post-mission transportation.\u00a0\n\nThe cost of transporting international partner astronauts and space flight participants not employed by the U.S. government must be reimbursed to the Department of the Treasury.\u00a0"
