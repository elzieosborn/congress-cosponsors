This bill increases Amtrak's open meeting and public disclosure requirements.

Specifically, the Amtrak Board of Directors must comply with federal open meeting requirements under the Government in the Sunshine Act.

In addition, at least 30 days prior to the board convening, the board must publicly post an announcement of the meeting and the anticipated meeting agenda.

The board must also annually convene a meeting to which state departments of transportation&#160;with long-distance routes or state-supported routes are&#160;invited to participate.

Further, Amtrak must publicly disclose the discretionary bonus compensation paid to an Amtrak officer or non-bargaining unit employee.

Upon request,&#160;Amtrak must also disclose to a state or the State-Amtrak Intercity Passenger Rail Committee vendor agreements of $250,000 or more for certain services on state-supported routes.</summary>
