    "text": "Western Wildfire Support Act of 2025\u00a0\n\nThis bill addresses wildfires by authorizing post-fire recovery activities, supporting adoption of technology, and requiring additional federal coordination.\n\nThe bill authorizes federal wildfire response and recovery activities by\n\nproviding statutory authority for Burned Area Emergency Response Teams to coordinate emergency stabilization and erosion planning, andestablishing an account to fund federal rehabilitation projects in areas impacted by a wildfire (e.g., ecosystem restoration, replacing infrastructure critical for land management).Additionally, for all hazard types, the bill includes post-disaster assistance in the federal disaster preparedness program and authorizes assistance to states for operating websites to provide information on post-disaster recovery resources.\n\nThe bill requires federal agencies to develop and utilize technologies for managing wildfires by\n\nexpediting the permitting and use of wildfire detection equipment (e.g., sensors, cameras);providing funding to Indian tribes for slip-on tanker units that convert vehicles into fire engines;performing research and development on wildfire response applications of unmanned aircraft systems (e.g., drones);studying radio communications systems, situational awareness tools, and\u00a0wildland fire predictive modeling; andadministering a prize competition for technological innovation for managing wildfire-related invasive species.The bill directs federal agencies to plan and coordinate on wildfire management by\n\nincorporating the best available science and planning tools into spatial fire management policies for federal lands, \u00a0collaborating with state agencies for mutual aid in fire suppression (including reimbursing states for suppressing fires caused by military operations), and\u00a0studying training gaps for integrating structural (e.g., local) firefighters into wildfire response."
