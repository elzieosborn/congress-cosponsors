This bill allows for the use of a pulsating light system for vehicle braking.

Specifically, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number&#160;108 (Standard 108)&#160;must be deemed to allow for the use of a pulsating light system on&#160;covered vehicles (i.e., passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, trailers, and motorcycles). The Department of Transportation must issue regulations to update Standard 108 to (1) include performance-based standards for pulsating light systems, and (2)&#160;allow for the use of the systems on motor vehicles.

As background, Standard 108 regulates all automotive lighting, signaling, and reflective devices. Under the bill, a pulsating light system includes a system for a high-mounted stop lamp in which the lamp pulses rapidly no more than four times and for no more than 1.2 seconds when the brake of the vehicle is applied and then converts to a continuous light (as a normal stop lamp) until the brake is released.</summary>
