This bill authorizes the Department of Transportation (DOT) to provide grants under the State of Good Repair Grants Program&#160;to assist states and local governments in financing public transportation resilience improvement projects that increase the resilience of public transportation systems from the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, flooding, wildfires, extreme weather events, and other natural disasters. Under the program, grants may be used for (1) standalone projects, and (2) components of capital projects.

DOT must submit an annual report to Congress on the grants provided under this bill and publish the report on DOT's website.&#160;</summary>
