The prohibition shall also apply to a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandchild, niece, or nephew of such an individual.\n\nThese prohibitions do not apply if an individual must be admitted for compliance with the United Nations headquarters agreement or other international obligations.\u00a0\n\nThe President may waive these prohibitions by certifying to Congress that the waiver is in the U.S. national interest."
