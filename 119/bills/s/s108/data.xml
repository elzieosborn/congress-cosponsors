This bill prohibits certain members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their families from receiving an F (academic student) or J (exchange visitor) visa.

Specifically, this prohibition shall apply to any CCP member who has served in any position in the CCP since this bill's enactment. The prohibition shall also apply to a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandchild, niece, or nephew of such an individual.

These prohibitions do not apply if an individual must be admitted for compliance with the United Nations headquarters agreement or other international obligations.&#160;

The President may waive these prohibitions by certifying to Congress that the waiver is in the U.S. national interest.</summary>
