    "text": "Investing in Community Resilience Act of 2025\n\nThis bill expands the activities eligible to increase the federal cost share under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA) program.\n\nUnder current law,\u00a0FEMA provides PA applicants (i.e., government entities and certain nonprofits) a minimum federal cost share of 75% of the costs of repairing or replacing eligible disaster-damaged facilities, but FEMA may increase this to up to 85% if the applicant invests in certain incentive measures that increase disaster readiness and resilience. The bill expands the measures eligible to cause this increase to include (1) investments in preparedness programs, (2) programs designated by\u00a0FEMA that increase disaster resilience through building standards or land use practices, and (3) support for community emergency response teams or similar non-governmental organizations that provide disaster assistance and advance preparedness.\n\nThe bill takes effect one year after enactment."
