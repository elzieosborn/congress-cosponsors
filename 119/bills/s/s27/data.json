    "text": "Federal Employee Return to Work Act\n\nThis bill prohibits providing certain annual or locality-based\u00a0pay increases to teleworking federal employees.\n\nCurrently, federal law mandates annual adjustments to General Schedule (GS) pay rates according to (1) a formula based on the annual percentage change in the Employment Cost Index (a measure of labor costs in the private sector); and (2) the difference between public and private sector pay rates in an employee's locality, if that difference exceeds 5%. For example, in 2025, the default annual rate of pay for a GS-7 (step 1) employee is $49,960; the adjusted annual rate of pay for a GS-7 (step 1) employee in the locality pay area that includes Washington, DC, is $57,164.\u00a0\n\nThe bill makes executive agency employees who telework at least one\u00a0day each week (or, in the case of an alternative work schedule, 20% or more each week) ineligible for these\u00a0payments.\n\nThe bill is effective on the first day of the fiscal year beginning after the bill's enactment.\u00a0"
