This bill requires cable and satellite broadcast providers to issue rebates to customers who are denied access to video programming included in their subscription because of programming negotiations.&#160;

Specifically, where a provider&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s negotiations related to the retransmission or carriage of video programming result in the provider failing to offer access to programming included in a customer&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s subscription, the customer must be issued a rebate for the affected period. The Federal Communications Commission is directed to issue rules to this effect, including to establish the appropriate amount for such a rebate. &#160;</summary>
