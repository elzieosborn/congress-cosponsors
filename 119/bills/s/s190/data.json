    "text": "North Pacific Research Board Enhancement Act\n\nThis bill makes certain changes to the North Pacific Research Board, including changes to the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s composition and allocations for funding for administrative expenses. The board sets research priorities and administers grants to support research on fisheries and marine ecosystems in the waters surrounding Alaska.\n\nSpecifically, this bill adds to the board one additional member to represent Alaska Natives. This board member must have personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses of resources (the practice of relying on the surrounding environment as a source of food and material). The bill also imposes a three-year term limit on those board members representing fishing interests and Alaska Natives, and permits such members to serve one additional term upon reappointment.\n\nWith respect to funding, under current law the board may use up to 15% of grant\u00a0program\u00a0funding for administrative expenses (e.g., support for the board and grant administration). Under the bill, if the program's total funding in a given fiscal year is less than its total funding in the prior fiscal year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may increase the 15% cap on administrative expenses for that fiscal year. Any such increase must prioritize supporting the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued operation, maximizing funds directed to research, and maintaining high-quality grant administration. Further, the bill waives the 15% cap altogether for five years following the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enactment.\u00a0"
