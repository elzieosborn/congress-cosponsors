    "text": "Veterinary Services to Improve Public Health in Rural Communities Act\n\nThis bill expands support for public health veterinary services (e.g., disease surveillance or vaccination) in tribal communities to address zoonotic infectious diseases (i.e., diseases that spread between humans and animals).\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Indian Health Service (IHS), to expend funds for public health veterinary services to prevent and control zoonotic disease infection and transmission in IHS areas where the risk for disease occurrence in humans and wildlife is endemic.\n\nHHS may assign or deploy veterinary public health officers from the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps to IHS areas.\n\nAdditionally, HHS must submit a biennial report to Congress on the use of funds, the assignment and deployment of veterinary public health officers from the\u00a0USPHS Commissioned Corps, data related to the monitoring and disease surveillance of\u00a0zoonotic diseases, and related services.\n\nThe bill also includes the IHS as a coordinating agency in the National One Health Framework. (This framework addresses\u00a0zoonotic diseases and advances public health preparedness in the United States.)\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Agriculture to conduct a feasibility study on the delivery of oral rabies vaccines to wildlife reservoir species that are connected to the transmission of rabies to tribal members living in Arctic regions of the United States. The study must (1) evaluate the efficacy of the oral rabies vaccines, and (2) make recommendations to improve the delivery of these vaccines."
