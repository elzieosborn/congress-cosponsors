    "text": "Promoting Resilient Buildings Act\n\nThis bill increases flexibility for predisaster mitigation assistance for building code activities, prohibits using certain\u00a0loan funds for building code activities, and establishes a pilot program to fund residential resilience retrofits.\n\nUnder current law,\u00a0the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may provide predisaster hazard mitigation assistance to government entities for implementing the latest published editions of relevant building codes and standards. Also,\u00a0FEMA must consider a government entity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adoption of such building codes when determining whether to award it predisaster hazard mitigation assistance. The bill specifies that the building codes applicable in such instances are the two most recently published editions (i.e., either the current edition or the previous one).\n\nAlso, currently, under FEMA's Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund (STRLF) program, states and Indian tribal governments may provide loans to local governments for establishing and carrying out building codes and standards. The bill removes this authority, so\u00a0STRLF loans may not be used for such building code-related activities.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes a pilot program for FEMA to provide grants to government entities that then provide the funding to individuals for residential resilience retrofits. The retrofit projects must reduce risk to homes from local natural hazards and individuals must demonstrate financial need. To implement the pilot program,\u00a0FEMA may use up to 10% of the funds FEMA provides annually for\u00a0predisaster hazard mitigation assistance. The pilot program terminates at the end of FY2030.\u00a0"
