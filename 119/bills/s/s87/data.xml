This bill modifies and expands work requirements under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and certain housing programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Specifically, the bill expands the applicability of the work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). As background, SNAP recipients who are ABAWDs have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.

The bill applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 60 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.

Further, the&#160;ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted under the bill to a dependent child under the age of&#160;six. Currently, the child must be under the age of 18.&#160;

The bill allows a member of a household with responsibility for a dependent child to participate in SNAP&#160;for up to 6 months (currently 3 months) over a 36-month period without meeting the ABAWD work requirements.

The bill also includes an exception for an individual who (1) is responsible for a dependent individual, and (2) is married to and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP work requirements.

Additionally, the bill establishes work requirements for families residing in public housing by applying the SNAP work requirements for ABAWDs to the HUD public housing and tenant-based rental assistance (voucher) programs.</summary>
