This bill increases the monthly amount of the basic housing allowance for members of the uniformed services inside the United States.

Specifically, the monthly amount of allowance for a member must be the amount of the monthly cost of adequate housing in the area, as determined by the Department of Defense, for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and same dependency status as the member. (Currently, the allowance is based on the difference between this amount and a percentage of the national average monthly cost of housing for members with the same pay grade and dependency status.)</summary>
