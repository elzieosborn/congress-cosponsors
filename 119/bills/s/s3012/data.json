An excepted employee is an employee who is required to work during a government shutdown.\n\nUnder current law, excepted employees are not paid until the government shutdown is over. This bill provides appropriations to pay excepted employees during a government shutdown. The bill also specifies that the term\u00a0excepted employee includes certain contractors who support federal employees during a government shutdown and members of the Armed Forces who are on active duty.\u00a0\n\nA federal agency may not use the funds provided by this bill during any period in which continuing appropriations are in effect for the purpose of paying\u00a0excepted employees of the agency.\n\nThe bill must take effect as if it had been enacted on September 30, 2025.\u00a0"
