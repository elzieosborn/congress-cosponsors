    "text": "Flood Insurance Affordability Tax Credit Act\n\nThis bill establishes a new refundable tax credit for up to 33% of the flood insurance premiums paid (or incurred) under the National Flood Insurance Program to insure a principal residence. The bill also requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to establish a program for paying the tax credit in advance.\n\nUnder the bill, the tax credit for flood insurance premiums may be reduced depending on the taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household income in relation to the federal poverty line (FPL). The tax credit begins to phase out once a taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household income is 350% of the FPL and is completely phased out once a taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household income reaches 435% of the FPL. (Other limitations may apply.)\n\nFurther, the tax credit for flood premiums may not be claimed by a married taxpayer who files a separate federal income tax return or a taxpayer who may be claimed as a dependent.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the IRS to establish a program that allows a taxpayer to receive the allowable tax credit amount for flood insurance premiums (based on tax return information for the most recent tax year available) in advance."
