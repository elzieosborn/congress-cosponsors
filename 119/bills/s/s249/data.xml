This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish, upon request, specific payment methodologies for qualifying pediatric technologies under the Medicare physician fee schedule.&#160;Qualifying pediatric technologies are medical devices that are (1) covered under Medicare, (2) approved by the Food and Drug Administration, (3) currently billed using a specified temporary billing code for emerging technologies, and (4) predominantly used or specifically designated for pediatric patients.

The CMS must develop a payment methodology for a qualifying pediatric technology upon request from the manufacturer and based on available data, including pricing information and claims data. Manufacturers must include relevant information in their requests to enable the CMS to develop the corresponding methodologies.</summary>
