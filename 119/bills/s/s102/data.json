The policies must also ensure that at least\u00a060% of the usable square feet of the agency's office space is occupied by agency employees.\u00a0\n\nAgencies that do not employ enough individuals to occupy 60%\u00a0of the agency's office space must provide an occupancy plan to the General Services Administration and Congress detailing how it will meet that goal, particularly by working with other federal agencies. The plan must be submitted within one year of the bill's enactment.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report to Congress regarding agencies' compliance with these requirements.\n\nAgencies that do not comply with these requirements must sell their properties, terminate leases, or not renew leases, as applicable."
