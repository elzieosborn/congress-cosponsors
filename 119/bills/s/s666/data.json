SAMHSA must raise awareness about the hotline and develop guidance regarding first responders for personnel operating the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. SAMHSA must report to Congress annually on the hotline.\n\nAlso, the bill expands the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program, which provides mental health services to victims of major disasters, so that emergency response providers responding to major disasters may also receive these services.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires\u00a0SAMHSA to publish a report with recommendations for establishing a mobile health care delivery site to provide crisis services to emergency response providers responding to a major disaster."
