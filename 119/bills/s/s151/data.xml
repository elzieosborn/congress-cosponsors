This bill prohibits the President from exercising authorities under the&#160;International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose or increase duties or impose tariff-rate quotas on imports entering the United States. However, this limitation does not prohibit the President from excluding all articles, or all of a certain type of article, imported from a country from entering the United States. (IEEPA provides the President with broad authority to regulate various economic transactions following a declaration of a national emergency.)</summary>
