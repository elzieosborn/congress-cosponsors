Currently, a person or entity is not eligible to receive certain benefits during a crop, fiscal, or program year if their average gross income exceeds $900,000.\n\nSpecifically, in the case of an excepted payment or benefit, the adjusted gross income limitation is waived if 75% or more of the average adjusted gross income for the person or entity is derived from farming, ranching, or silviculture activities. These activities include agritourism, direct-to-consumer marketing of agricultural products, and the sale of agricultural equipment owned by such person or entity.\n\nThe bill applies to the USDA\n\nLivestock Indemnity Program;Livestock Forage Disaster Program;Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program;Tree Assistance Program; andNoninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program."
