This bill addresses migrant minor children entering the United States. Specifically, the bill makes it a crime for a person to knowingly use a minor to gain entry to the United States if the minor is not a close relative or if the person is not the minor&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s guardian. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must fingerprint all non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) entering the United States who are younger than 14 years of age if a CBP officer suspects that the child is victim of human trafficking.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must share with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) any fingerprints collected under this bill from an unaccompanied child if that child is transferred to HHS custody.

DHS must report to Congress on the number of children fingerprinted annually under this bill. DHS must also publish on a monthly basis the number of individuals apprehended for falsely claiming a child accompanying them into the United States was a close relative. &#160;</summary>
