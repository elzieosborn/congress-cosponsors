    "text": "Travel Trailer and Camper Tax Parity Act\n\nThis bill expands the exclusion of interest on floor plan financing from the limit on the tax deduction for\u00a0business interest expenses to include interest on floor plan financing of certain non-motorized, towable campers and trailers.\u00a0\n\nUnder current law, the tax deduction for business interest expenses is generally limited to 30% of adjusted taxable income. (Some exceptions apply.) However, under current law, interest on floor plan financing (financing used to acquire inventory for sale or lease) of motorized vehicles (e.g., self-propelled vehicles designed to transport people) is excluded from the limit on the tax deduction for business interest expenses.\n\nUnder the bill, the exclusion of interest on floor plan financing from the limit on the tax deduction for business interest expenses is expanded to include interest on floor plan financing of any camper or trailer designed to (1) provide temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, or seasonal use; and (2) be towed by, or affixed to, a motor vehicle.\u00a0"
