(STEM refers to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.)\n\nDuring this established week, the committee must encourage educational institutions (i.e., elementary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education) to participate in the week and also encourage families of students\u00a0attending these educational institutions to participate in STEM activities. Additionally, the committee must encourage STEM industries to (1) engage with students enrolled in educational institutions by providing mentorship programs, site visits, and guest lectures; and (2) support STEM education initiatives at these educational institutions through funding, resources, and expertise.\n\nThe committee must annually report to Congress on the activities conducted during the established week."
