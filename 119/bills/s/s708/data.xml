This bill establishes a rebuttable presumption for injunctive relief in patent infringement cases. Specifically, if a court enters a final judgment finding infringement of a right secured by patent, the patent owner shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that the court should grant a permanent injunction with respect to that infringing conduct.

(In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court held in&#160;eBay&#160;v. MercExchange that patent holders do not have an automatic right to a permanent injunction in a patent infringement case.)</summary>
