Specifically, if a court enters a final judgment finding infringement of a right secured by patent, the patent owner shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that the court should grant a permanent injunction with respect to that infringing conduct.\n\n(In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court held in\u00a0eBay\u00a0v. MercExchange that patent holders do not have an automatic right to a permanent injunction in a patent infringement case.)"
