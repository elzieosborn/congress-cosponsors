  <summary date="2025-02-28T17:06:35Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025

This bill revises requirements for milk provided by the National School Lunch Program of the Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Currently, schools participating in the program must provide milk that is consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans; USDA regulations require milk to be fat-free or low-fat and allow milk to be flavored or unflavored. The bill modifies these restrictions and instead permits schools to offer students whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free flavored and unflavored milk. The milk that is offered may be organic or nonorganic.

Further, schools&#160;currently must provide a substitute for fluid milk, on receipt of a written statement from a licensed physician,&#160;for students whose disability restricts their diet. Under the bill, a parent or legal guardian may also provide the written statement.

In addition, schools currently participating in the program must provide meals that meet certain nutrition requirements;&#160;USDA regulations require that the average saturated fat content of the meals offered must be less than 10% of the total calories. Under the bill, fluid milk is excluded from the saturated fat content calculation; milk fat included in any fluid milk provided by the program must not be considered saturated fat for the purposes of measuring compliance with USDA regulations.</summary>
