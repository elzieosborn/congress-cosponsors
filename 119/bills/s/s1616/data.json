    "text": "Producing Responsible Energy and Conservation Incentives and Solutions for the Environment Act of 2025 or the PRECISE Act of 2025\n\nThis bill incorporates support for precision agriculture into various programs of the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Precision agriculture refers to managing, tracking, or reducing crop or livestock production inputs, including seed, feed, fertilizer, chemicals, water, and time, at a heightened level of spatial and temporal granularity to improve efficiencies, reduce waste, and maintain environmental quality. Precision agriculture technology includes any technology and equipment that directly contributes to a reduction in, or improved efficiency of, inputs used in crop or livestock production.\n\nSpecifically, the bill makes changes to eligibility criteria, payments, and other aspects of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program. These changes include allowing the programs to support the adoption of precision agriculture practices and acquisition of precision agriculture technologies.\n\nIn addition, the bill expands a program through which USDA makes and insures loans to for-profit and nonprofit organizations that invest in rural areas by allowing the loans to be used for precision agriculture practices.\n\nAlso, USDA must emphasize the use of third-party providers when providing technical assistance on matters related to soil health for participants in certain USDA conservation programs. This includes planning related to the use of cover crops, precision agriculture practices, and comprehensive nutrient management."
