Jurisdictions that prohibit such cooperation are barred from receiving certain federal funding.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must within 48 hours of a request by a state or local authority take custody of an individual unlawfully present in the United States. The bill also establishes requirements for state or local detention and provides for reimbursement for reasonable expenses. The Government Accountability Office must also audit such reimbursements.\n\nDHS must also construct 20 additional detention facilities in the United States for individuals facing removal.\n\nThe bill also (1) extends certain federal immunity from liability to state and local law enforcement officers, (2) provides immunity to state or local law enforcement agencies from certain money damages, and (3) requires states to participate in programs to expedite the removal of individuals subject to removal who are serving criminal sentences.\n\nThe bill also establishes a grant program, provides for the development of state and local law enforcement training materials, and requires state and local governments to\u00a0provide information about certain detained individuals."
