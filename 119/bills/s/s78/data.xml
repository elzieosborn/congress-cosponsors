This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to certain executive branch agencies for the development of internal control plans that are available for immediate use in future emergencies or crises. (Internal control refers to a process that provides reasonable assurance of achieving effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting, and legal compliance.)

This guidance must be in alignment with the Government Accountability Office reports entitled A Framework for Managing Improper Payments in Emergency Assistance Programs and A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs.&#160;

Periodically, the agencies subject to this guidance must submit their internal control plan to&#160;OMB and OMB must submit such agency plans to Congress.</summary>
