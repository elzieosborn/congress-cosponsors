    "text": "Maintaining American Superiority by Improving Export Control Transparency Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to annually report to Congress on export control licensing.\n\nUnder current law, BIS administers and enforces controls on the export of dual-use goods (e.g., items with both civilian and military uses) and certain military parts and components. These export controls are implemented primarily under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).\n\nUnder this bill, BIS must annually report to Congress on license applications, enforcement actions, and other requests for authorization for the export, reexport, release, and in-country transfer of items subject to the\u00a0EAR to covered entities. A covered entity is any entity that (1) is located or operating in a country listed in Country Group D:5 (countries that are identified by the Department of State as subject to U.S. arms embargoes), and (2) is included on the Entity List or the Military End-User List (two of the lists published by BIS containing information on the individuals, organizations, and addresses subject to restrictions involving items subject to the EAR).\n\nThe bill requires this report to include specified information, such as the name of the entity submitting the application, where the item is being exported, the decision with respect to the license application or authorization, and information on related enforcement activities to ensure\u00a0compliance with U.S. export controls. The information shall be exempt from public disclosure (except for aggregate statistics)."
