This bill prohibits federal contract bid solicitations for contractor personnel from including minimum educational requirements unless the contracting officer justifies the requirements.&#160;The prohibition applies to educational requirements that may be met through education alone, education or experience, or a combination of education and experience.

The bill also requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue implementing guidance to federal agencies, including instructions for contracting officers that encourage using alternatives to education requirements.</summary>
