    "text": "Medicaid VBPs for Patients Act or the MVP Act\n\nThis bill provides statutory authority for regulations that allow for the use of varying best price points under value-based purchasing arrangements for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. (Value-based purchasing arrangements refer to arrangements in which the price of a drug is linked to clinical outcomes; such arrangements are particularly used for new high-cost treatments, such as gene therapies.)\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must study the impact of value-based purchasing arrangements on federal health care programs, including with respect to the bill's changes.\n\nAdditionally, the bill (1) exempts sales of drugs that are made under value-based purchasing arrangements from calculations of the manufacturer average sales price for purposes of payments under Medicare medical services, if the manufacturer reports multiple best prices under Medicaid in accordance with the bill's changes; and (2) requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to issue guidance on how\u00a0state Medicaid programs may cover drugs in inpatient settings via value-based purchasing arrangements."
