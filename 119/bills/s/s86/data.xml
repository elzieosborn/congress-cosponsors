  <summary date="2025-04-21T14:07:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill eliminates automatic increases to pay&#160;for Members of Congress, beginning with the 120th Congress.

Current law automatically increases Member&#160;pay according to a formula. The annual increase is (1) based on the percentage change in private sector wages as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI); and (2) capped at the percentage increase to General Schedule (GS) employees' base pay.&#160;The annual adjustment automatically goes into effect unless Congress modifies the increase in legislation.</summary>
