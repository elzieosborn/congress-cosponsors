The annual increase is (1) based on the percentage change in private sector wages as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI); and (2) capped at the percentage increase to General Schedule (GS) employees' base pay.\u00a0The annual adjustment automatically goes into effect unless Congress modifies the increase in legislation."
