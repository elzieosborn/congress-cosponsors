The bill also provides appropriations for the costs of\u00a0FSA services that were not provided to farmers on or after September 30, 2025, and before this bill is enacted due to a lapse in appropriations.\u00a0\n\nThe appropriations provided by this bill are available until legislation is enacted to provide FY2026 appropriations for USDA (including continuing appropriations).\u00a0"
