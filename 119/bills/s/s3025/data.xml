  <summary date="2025-10-29T14:29:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Fund Farm Programs Act of 2025

This bill provides appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to continue providing services for farmers&#160;through the Farm Service Agency (FSA)&#160;during any period in which legislation has not been enacted to provide continuing or full-year FY2026 appropriations to USDA.&#160;

Specifically, the bill provides appropriations to continue (1) uninterrupted services for farmers through the FSA; and (2) operations of&#160;FSA programs and offices, including with respect to farm loans. The bill also provides appropriations for the costs of&#160;FSA services that were not provided to farmers on or after September 30, 2025, and before this bill is enacted due to a lapse in appropriations.&#160;

The appropriations provided by this bill are available until legislation is enacted to provide FY2026 appropriations for USDA (including continuing appropriations).&#160;</summary>
