(An\u00a0ungulate is a hooved grazing mammal.)\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill allows USDA to provide grants to land-grant institutions for supporting the\u00a0research and development of wildfire-related ungulate grazing land management techniques that improve soil health and are compatible with activities that protect against adverse environmental effects. This includes compatibility with activities that\u00a0protect against the spread of invasive plant species and disease, soil erosion, water quality degradation, and watershed degradation.\n\nThe grants to land-grant universities may also be used to disseminate information to public and private landowners, land managers, and livestock owners regarding these wildfire-related\u00a0grazing land management techniques and compatible activities.\u00a0"
