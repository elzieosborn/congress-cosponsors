    "text": "Critical Minerals Security Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes requirements for the Department of the Interior related to securing U.S. access to critical minerals and rare earth element (REE) resources.\u00a0Critical minerals mean any mineral, element, substance, or material designated as critical by the U.S. Geological Survey.\u00a0REEs mean cerium, dysprosium, erbium, europium, gadolinium, holmium, lanthanum, lutetium, neodymium, praseodymium, promethium, samarium, scandium, terbium, thulium, ytterbium, and yttrium.\u00a0\n\nFirst, Interior must report on the critical mineral and\u00a0REE resources, including recyclable or recycled materials containing those resources, around the world. Among other information, the\u00a0report must include an assessment of the\u00a0global ownership and supply of critical mineral and\u00a0REE resources. Interior must submit the report within a year and every two years thereafter.\n\nNext, Interior must establish a process to assist a U.S. person\u00e2\u20ac\u201da U.S. citizen, a non-U.S. National (alien under federal law) lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an entity organized under U.S. laws\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseeking to divest stock in mining, processing, or recycling operations for critical minerals and\u00a0REEs in a foreign country with finding a purchaser that is not under the control of North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran.\n\nFinally, Interior must develop (1) a strategy to collaborate with U.S. allies and partners to develop advanced mining, refining, separation, processing, and recycling technologies; and (2) a method for sharing related\u00a0intellectual property with U.S. allies and partners to enable those countries to license those technologies and develop their resources."
