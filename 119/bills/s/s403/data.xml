This bill provides statutory authority for the Office of Rural Health (ORH) within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The&#160;CDC established the ORH in 2023 in response to a congressional directive, and it currently leads the CDC&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s rural public health strategy.

Specifically, the bill requires the CDC to establish the ORH and select a director to head the ORH. The bill specifies the duties and authorities of the&#160;ORH director, including improving understanding of particular challenges and implementing programs to improve health care for rural populations.&#160;</summary>
