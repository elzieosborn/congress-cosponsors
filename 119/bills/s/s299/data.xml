This bill establishes grants to support mentoring programs for eligible youth (e.g., in-school youth, out-of-school youth, or youth who are failing academically or who meet specified criteria).&#160;

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Labor to award competitive grants for certain community-based organizations or partnerships involving community-based organizations to (1) establish, expand, or support mentoring programs; (2) assist eligible youth enrolled in secondary schools in developing cognitive and social-emotional skills; and (3) prepare eligible youth for success in high school, postsecondary education, and the workforce.

Additionally, Labor must work with the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the Department of Education to (1) refer grant recipients to the National Mentoring Resource Center to obtain mentoring resources, and (2) provide grant recipients with information regarding transitional services for eligible youth returning from correctional facilities and transition services for students with disabilities.

The bill also requires Labor's Chief Evaluation Office to study and report on mentoring programs.</summary>
