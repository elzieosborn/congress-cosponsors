This bill prohibits institutions of higher education or other research institutes that are conducting gain-of-function research from receiving federal research grants. Gain-of-function research means research that (1) involves the genetic alteration of specified viruses, agents, and toxins (e.g., coronavirus) to change or enhance their functions, such as their ability to cause or spread disease; or (2) may reasonably be anticipated to give new traits to such organisms that enhance such functions or otherwise threaten public health or national security.</summary>
