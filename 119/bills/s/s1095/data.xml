This bill makes it an unfair method of competition to submit an objectively baseless petition to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an attempt to interfere with a competitor's application for market approval of a drug.

The bill authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to sue an individual or entity that submits such a petition to the FDA. A party found liable in such a lawsuit is subject to civil penalties, such as a fine of up to $50,000 for each day that the FDA spent reviewing the baseless petition.</summary>
