    "text": "Increased TSP Access Act of 2025\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to modify the\u00a0certification process for Technical Service Providers (TSPs) at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) by establishing an approval process for nonfederal certifying entities and a streamlined certification process for TSPs that hold certain specialty certifications.\n\nAs background, TSPs are third-party service providers, such as private businesses, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations, that work on behalf of customers to offer planning, design, and implementation services that meet NRCS criteria.\n\nThe bill specifies that USDA must ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, third-party providers with expertise in the technical aspects of conservation practice design, implementation, and evaluation are eligible to become approved TSPs.\n\nUSDA must provide a streamlined certification process for TSPs who hold appropriate specialty certifications (e.g., certified crop advisors).\n\nIn determining the eligibility of a nonfederal certifying entity, USDA must consider the ability, experience, expertise, and history of the entity. USDA must decide whether to approve an application submitted by a nonfederal certifying entity to certify\u00a0TSPs\u00a0within a specified time period. \u00a0\n\nUSDA must also review a TSP's certification by a nonfederal certifying entity within a specified time period. If the certification is satisfactory, USDA must include the\u00a0TSP on a USDA-maintained registry of certified TSPs.\n\nThe bill also specifies that TSPs must be paid at rates equivalent to technical assistance provided by USDA.\n\nFurther, USDA must provide accessible public information on TSPs, including information on funding, certification results, and utilization rates."
