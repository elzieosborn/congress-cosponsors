This bill provides continuing appropriations for military pay for any period during which continuing or full-year appropriations for FY2026 are not in effect (i.e., a government shutdown).

The benefits funded by the bill include individual clothing, subsistence, interest on deposits, gratuities, permanent change of station travel, and monthly payments to surviving spouses who care for a child of a member or former member of the Armed Forces.

The bill also provides FY2026 continuing appropriations for

pay and allowances for Department of Defense (DOD) civilian personnel (and Department of Homeland Security [DHS] personnel in the case of the Coast Guard) who are providing support to such members of the Armed Forces, andpayments for DOD contractors (and&#160;DHS contractors in the case of the Coast Guard) who are providing support to the members of the Armed Forces.A federal agency may not use funds provided by this bill during any period in which continuing appropriations are available&#160;for the same payments, allowances, and benefits that are funded by this bill. &#160;

If a government shutdown occurs, the bill provides the continuing appropriations until the earlier of (1) the enactment into law of specified appropriations legislation, or (2) September 30, 2026.&#160;</summary>
