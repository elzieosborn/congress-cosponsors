  <summary date="2025-06-09T20:54:28Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Responsibility in Drug Advertising Act of 2025

This bill prohibits direct-to-consumer advertising of new drugs during the first three years following their approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Direct-to-consumer advertising includes advertising via social media.&#160;

Upon request from a drug&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s sponsor, the FDA may waive the prohibition during the third year following a drug&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s approval if it determines that the direct-to-consumer advertising of the drug would have an affirmative value to public health. Conversely, the FDA may prohibit such advertising beyond the three-year period following approval if it determines that the drug has significant adverse health effects based on post-approval studies, adverse event reports, and other appropriate resources.&#160;

The prohibition applies to new drugs approved beginning one year before the bill&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s enactment.</summary>
