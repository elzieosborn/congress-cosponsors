This bill requires the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to provide grants to states to address gambling addiction, and authorizes the National Institute on Drug Abuse to provide grants for research on gambling addiction.

The&#160;bill authorizes appropriations for&#160;the grant programs through FY2034 from a portion&#160;of the revenue from the federal excise tax on state-authorized wagers (e.g., state-authorized sports betting).

Additionally,&#160;SAMHSA must allocate its grants for addressing gambling addiction among the states in the same ratios as grants under the&#160;Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant program. The bill also requires a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the programs established by the bill.&#160;</summary>
