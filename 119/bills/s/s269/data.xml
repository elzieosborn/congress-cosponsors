This bill permanently allows the Department of the Treasury to access certain death records maintained by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in order to facilitate the identification&#160;and prevention of improper payments (e.g., payments&#160;to deceased individuals).&#160;

Current law requires the SSA to share its Death Master File with the Do Not Pay system maintained by Treasury for three years.&#160;The bill makes this requirement permanent.</summary>
