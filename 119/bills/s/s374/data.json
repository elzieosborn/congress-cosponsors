    "text": "Direct Property Acquisitions Act\n\nThis bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a pilot program for local governments selected by FEMA to apply directly to FEMA for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) assistance for property acquisition and structure demolition or relocation projects. FEMA must also submit annual reports.\n\nUnder current\u00a0FEMA regulations, local governments are ineligible to apply directly to FEMA for HMGP assistance and must apply indirectly through a state or Indian tribal government. The bill authorizes local governments, if determined eligible and selected by\u00a0FEMA, to apply directly to FEMA for HMGP assistance for property acquisition. The pilot program must terminate within eight years after\u00a0FEMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial selection. Local governments may participate for up to 48 months.\u00a0\n\nThe bill requires\u00a0FEMA to select up to two local governments from each of FEMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 regions (only one per state) to participate. For a local government to be eligible,\u00a0FEMA must determine it is capable of meeting all applicable federal and state requirements for administering hazard mitigation assistance with limited assistance from the state, and FEMA must receive positive feedback from the state regarding its eligibility. In making this determination,\u00a0FEMA must consult with the state and provide written justification for its decision based on factors including the local government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history of implementing hazard mitigation projects and level of risk from severe weather.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires\u00a0FEMA to submit to specified congressional committees an annual report evaluating the pilot program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness and future.\u00a0"
