This information must be collected from employees working primarily on-site within 180 days after the bill's enactment and from teleworking employees within one year after the bill's enactment.\u00a0The bill also directs each agency to publish this data in the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal year budget justification materials, including a comparison of the average login rates of\u00a0on-site and teleworking employees.\n\nNext, the bill directs any manager who revokes\u00a0a teleworking employee's authorization to telework\u00a0(due to a reason specific to that employee)\u00a0to\u00a0document for the employee and the agency's Human Capital Office\u00a0(1) the total number of days that the employee teleworked in the six work periods immediately preceding the revocation, (2) a narrative summary of the circumstances giving rise to the revocation, and (3) any steps the manager took to discipline the employee before revoking the employee's telework authorization.\u00a0\n\nFinally, agencies must report to the Chief Human Capital Officers Council\u00a0about any\u00a0adverse effects of telework\u00a0policies\u00a0on the performance of the executive agency."
