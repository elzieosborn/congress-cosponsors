This bill directs executive agencies to track employees' computer network activity, compare the activity of teleworking and on-site employees,&#160;and report on any&#160;deficiencies in the performance of teleworking employees.

First, the bill requires each agency to establish policies to track for every employee (1) the average number of daily logins,&#160;(2) the average daily duration of the network connection, and (3) the network traffic generated while the employee works. This information must be collected from employees working primarily on-site within 180 days after the bill's enactment and from teleworking employees within one year after the bill's enactment.&#160;The bill also directs each agency to publish this data in the agency&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s fiscal year budget justification materials, including a comparison of the average login rates of&#160;on-site and teleworking employees.

Next, the bill directs any manager who revokes&#160;a teleworking employee's authorization to telework&#160;(due to a reason specific to that employee)&#160;to&#160;document for the employee and the agency's Human Capital Office&#160;(1) the total number of days that the employee teleworked in the six work periods immediately preceding the revocation, (2) a narrative summary of the circumstances giving rise to the revocation, and (3) any steps the manager took to discipline the employee before revoking the employee's telework authorization.&#160;

Finally, agencies must report to the Chief Human Capital Officers Council&#160;about any&#160;adverse effects of telework&#160;policies&#160;on the performance of the executive agency.</summary>
