This bill provides continuing appropriations for military pay during any period in&#160;which interim or full-year appropriations for FY2026 are not in effect (i.e., a government shutdown).

Specifically, the bill provides FY2026 continuing appropriations for the pay and allowances of members of the Armed Forces, including reserve components, who perform active service or inactive duty training during the period.&#160;

The appropriations provided by this bill are available until legislation is enacted that provides FY2026 appropriations for military pay (including continuing appropriations for this purpose).&#160;</summary>
