The bill's\u00a0tailoring requirement applies to future regulatory actions and to regulations adopted within the last seven years.\n\nThe bill also reduces certain reporting requirements for community banks eligible for a simplified capital leverage ratio.\n\nFinally, federal banking agencies must report on the modernization of bank supervision, including examiner workforce and training and statutory changes necessary to achieve more effective supervision."
