This bill addresses the supervision of financial institutions.

Federal financial regulatory agencies must (1) tailor any regulatory actions so as to limit burdens on the institutions involved,&#160;with consideration of the risk profiles and business models of those institutions; and (2) report to Congress on specific actions taken to do so, as well as on other related issues. The bill's&#160;tailoring requirement applies to future regulatory actions and to regulations adopted within the last seven years.

The bill also reduces certain reporting requirements for community banks eligible for a simplified capital leverage ratio.

Finally, federal banking agencies must report on the modernization of bank supervision, including examiner workforce and training and statutory changes necessary to achieve more effective supervision.</summary>
