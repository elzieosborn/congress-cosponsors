    "text": "Overturn\u00a0Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Offshore Energy Ban Act\n\nThis bill nullifies two presidential memoranda that were published on January 6, 2025, including (1) the Memorandum on the Withdrawal of Certain Areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from Oil or Natural Gas Leasing, relating to the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and Pacific areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS); and (2) the Memorandum on the Withdrawal of Certain Areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from Oil or Natural Gas Leasing, relating to\u00a0the Bering Sea areas of the OCS. The memoranda\u00a0prohibited the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) from issuing offshore leases for the exploration, development, or production (i.e., offshore drilling) of oil or natural gas in those areas.\n\nThis bill reverses the withdrawal to allow\u00a0BOEM to issue leases in\u00a0those areas."
