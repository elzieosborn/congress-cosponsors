    "text": "Stop Human Trafficking of Unaccompanied Migrant Children Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes requirements relating to placing unaccompanied alien children with sponsors. (Under federal law, an unaccompanied alien child is a minor with no lawful immigration status and no parent or legal guardian in the United States to provide care and physical custody.)\n\nBefore the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may release such a child to a sponsor, the sponsor must complete a fingerprint background check and vetting that includes (1) a public records check, (2) a National Sex Offender Registry check, (3) a Federal Bureau of Investigation National Criminal History Check, (4) a child abuse and neglect check, and (5) state and local criminal history checks. Each adult in the sponsor's household must also undergo such vetting before the placement.\n\nThe bill also requires HHS to visit the home of a proposed sponsor before the placement and to conduct periodic home visits after.\n\nA child may not be placed with a sponsor who is unlawfully present in the United States unless the sponsor is the child's parent, relative, or legal guardian.\n\nHHS must retroactively apply these vetting standards to all sponsors for placements made since January 20, 2021."
