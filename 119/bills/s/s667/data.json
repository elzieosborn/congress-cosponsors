    "text": "Safer Shrimp Imports Act\n\nThis bill prohibits the importation of shrimp from countries that do not have food inspection systems equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection system for shrimp, or that have not entered into an agreement with the FDA facilitating U.S. inspection of their food facilities. \u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the FDA must seek to enter into arrangements and agreements with the government of each country with at least one facility that manufactures, processes, packs, or holds shrimp for consumption in the United States to facilitate FDA inspection of such facilities.\u00a0\n\nThe bill prohibits the importation of shrimp that is manufactured, processed, packed, or held in a country (1) that has not entered into an inspection arrangement or agreement with the FDA, or (2) the food inspection system of which is not equivalent to the FDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food inspection system with respect to shrimp. To be considered equivalent, a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food inspection system must include staffing that ensures uniform enforcement of applicable laws and regulations, and must provide for the enforcement of laws and regulations that address conditions under which shrimp are raised and transported to processing facilities. \u00a0\n\nFurther, shrimp imported or offered for import into the United States that have been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in a country that is not compliant with these requirements are deemed adulterated, and thus may not be introduced into interstate commerce.\u00a0"
