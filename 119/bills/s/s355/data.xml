The rule must replace references to animal tests, data, studies, models, and research with references to nonclinical tests, data, studies, models, and research throughout the FDA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s regulations governing investigational new drug applications, and may make other changes to the regulations as appropriate.&#160;

The rule must be published within one year of the bill&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s enactment, and must take immediate effect as an interim final rule.&#160;</summary>
