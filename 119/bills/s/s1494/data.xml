This bill allows the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) of the Farm Service Agency to provide additional coverage for crops and grasses used for grazing. Specifically, the bill removes an exception that prohibits certain additional coverage&#160;for&#160;crops and grasses used for grazing. (NAP provides financial assistance to producers of non-insurable crops when&#160;natural disasters result&#160;in lower yields,&#160;crop losses, or prevented crop planting.)</summary>
