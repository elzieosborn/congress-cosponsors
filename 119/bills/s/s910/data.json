As background, the Farm Service Agency Direct Loan Program provides Farm Ownership Loans to farmers and ranchers for the purchase and development of farm property.\n\nUnder the five-year pilot program, USDA must prioritize outreach to organizations that have demonstrated engagement with beginning farmers or ranchers.\n\nIn addition, USDA may make use of alternative methods, including financial benchmarking, to reliably evaluate the financial viability of a participant in the pilot program and the likelihood of repayment of the applicable loan.\n\nUSDA must submit an annual report to Congress on the pilot program, which must include a description of the program's performance outcomes and a recommendation as to the pilot program's value."
