This bill limits birthright citizenship by redefining what it means to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

Currently, a person born in the United States and subject to U.S. jurisdiction is entitled to citizenship. Under the bill, a person is subject to U.S. jurisdiction if he or she is born to a parent who is (1) a U.S. citizen or national, (2) a lawful permanent resident residing in the United States, or (3) a non-U.S. national (alien under federal law)&#160;in lawful status who is performing active service in the Armed Forces.

The bill does not affect the citizenship or nationality status of any person born before the bill's enactment date.</summary>
