This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that any call made to a veteran by a VA employee or contractor regarding VA services or benefits is made from a single, well-known telephone number and uses caller identification that indicates the call is from or on behalf of the VA.

The VA must also ensure the Veterans Health Administration has at least one call center in each time zone in the United States to address concerns regarding appointments and referrals for health care.</summary>
