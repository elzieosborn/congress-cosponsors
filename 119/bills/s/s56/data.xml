This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to solicit input from maple industry stakeholders with respect to the research and education priorities of the maple industry for the Acer Access and Development Program (Acer). Specifically, the bill amends Acer to require USDA to consider the information provided through consultation with the maple industry when making program grants.

The bill also extends the program's authorization through FY2030.

As background, Acer provides competitive grants to states, tribal governments, and research institutions to support their efforts to promote the domestic maple syrup industry through activities&#160;associated with, among other things,&#160;the promotion of (1) research and education related to maple syrup production, and (2) natural resource sustainability in the maple syrup industry.</summary>
