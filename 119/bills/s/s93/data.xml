  <summary date="2025-04-28T17:04:17Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2025

This bill extends through FY2030 and modifies the Harmful Algal Bloom and&#160;Hypoxia Research and Control Act to address algal blooms and hypoxia (deficiency of oxygen) in U.S. marine, estuarine, and freshwater systems. Harmful algal blooms are high concentrations of algae that may create nuisance or toxic conditions that are harmful to humans, animals, aquatic ecosystems, and the economy.

The bill directs the Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia to submit to Congress an action strategy for harmful algal blooms at least once every five years. The bill also expands the task force's membership&#160;to include the Department of Energy.

The bill also expands the duties of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the National Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia program. NOAA must also carry out a variety of activities related to monitoring, predicting, preventing, mitigating, and responding to marine, coastal, and Great Lakes harmful algal bloom and hypoxia events. For example, NOAA must establish&#160;(1) a national network of observing systems for monitoring, detecting, and forecasting harmful algal blooms; and (2) a national-level incubator program to increase the number of strategies, technologies, and measures available to prevent, mitigate, and control harmful algal blooms.

Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency must develop and enhance operational freshwater harmful algal bloom monitoring, observing, and forecasting programs in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs and carry out other activities related to researching freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events.</summary>
