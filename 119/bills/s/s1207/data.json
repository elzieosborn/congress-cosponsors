    "text": "Feral Swine Eradication Act\n\nThis bill reauthorizes\u00a0the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program through FY2030\u00a0and removes the pilot program designation. This Department of Agriculture (USDA) program responds to the threat feral swine pose to agriculture, native ecosystems, and human and animal health.\n\nIn addition, USDA must require\u00a0the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)\u00a0to\u00a0continue monitoring an\u00a0area for reoccurrence of feral swine for one year after USDA determines that feral swine has been eradicated from\u00a0an eligible\u00a0area.\n\nThe bill requires 60% of the funds provided for the program to be allocated to APHIS and 40% of the funds to be allocated to the NRCS. (Under current law, the funds are divided evenly between APHIS and\u00a0the NRCS).\u00a0\n\nFurther, the bill includes new reporting requirements, which direct APHIS and the NRCS to submit a joint report to Congress on the program. This report must be publicly available on USDA's website."
