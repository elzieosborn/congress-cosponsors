This bill specifies that funds provided under the Farm Storage Facility Loan Program may be used to construct or upgrade storage facilities for propane that is primarily used for agricultural production.

This Department of Agriculture loan program provides low-interest financing for agricultural producers to build or upgrade commodity storage facilities. Some agricultural producers use propane to power agricultural operations (e.g., grain dryers, irrigation engines, and barn heating).</summary>
