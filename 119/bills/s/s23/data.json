    "text": "Decentralizing and Reorganizing Agency Infrastructure Nation-wide To Harness Efficient Services, Workforce Administration, and Management Practices Act or the DRAIN THE SWAMP Act\n\nThis bill relocates 30% of\u00a0employees of executive agencies who are based in the Washington, DC area\u00a0and reduces the office headquarters of agencies by 30%. It also ends full-time telework for relocated\u00a0employees and for those who remain based\u00a0in the DC area.\n\nUnder the bill, each agency must relocate at\u00a0least 30% of full-time employees based at the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters, including full-time\u00a0telework employees who receive DC-area locality pay (unless telework is an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act). The bill does not apply to certain essential employees in the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Defense,\u00a0the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Energy, and the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn determining the new duty stations, each agency must promote geographic diversity and ensure adequate staffing throughout the regions of the agency. Compensation for relocated\u00a0employees must be according to the locality pay scale for their new duty station. Agencies must provide their reduction plans to Congress within 180 days and complete the relocations within one year after the bill's enactment.\n\nFurther, the Office of Management and Budget must\u00a0identify at least 30% of agency headquarters' office space (i.e., real property) to sell or to cease leasing. Agency heads must complete the space reduction within two years after the bill's enactment.\u00a0"
