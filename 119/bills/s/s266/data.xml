This bill&#160;reauthorizes through FY2029 and revises Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) grants for programs and training to improve mental health among health care professionals and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiative to educate health care professionals about their mental health and related services.

Specifically, the bill reauthorizes HRSA grants to health care service providers and medical professional associations to implement programs supporting these professionals&#226;&#8364;&#8482; mental health, such as through peer-support programs or providing mental health care. It also authorizes&#160;HRSA to prioritize applicants that focus on reducing administrative burden on health care workers.

Also, the bill reauthorizes HRSA grants to government and certain educational entities for training health care students and professionals on how to address mental health and related issues. It also specifies that grants or contracts awarded under the program must be for not less than three years.

Additionally, the bill&#160;reauthorizes a CDC education and awareness initiative to help health care professionals understand and seek support for their mental health. It also requires the&#160;CDC to submit annual reports to specified congressional committees on the initiative&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s activities and outcomes.</summary>
