This prohibition begins on October 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill allows DHS to waive the prohibition if DHS assesses in the affirmative that (1)\u00a0the batteries to be procured do not pose a risk to U.S. national security, data, or infrastructure; and (2)\u00a0there is no available alternative to procure batteries that are of similar or better cost and quality and that are produced by an entity not specified in this bill.\n\nDHS may also waive the prohibition upon a determination that the batteries to be procured are for the sole purpose of research, evaluation, training, testing, or analysis.\n\nThe bill requires DHS to notify Congress within 15 days after granting a waiver under this bill.\n\nThe bill also requires DHS to report to Congress on the anticipated impacts associated with carrying out this bill, including with respect to specified agencies of DHS."
