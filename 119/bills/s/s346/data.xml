  <summary date="2025-05-01T16:21:53Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Knife Owners&#226;&#8364;&#8482; Protection Act of 2025

This bill permits an individual to transport a knife between two places (e.g., states) where knife possession, carry, or transport is legal. The knife must be transported in&#160;compliance with the bill's&#160;accessibility and secure storage requirements, unless it is an emergency knife or tool designed to cut seat belts.

An individual who is transporting a knife in compliance with this bill may not be arrested or detained for a knife violation unless there is probable cause to believe the individual failed to comply with the accessibility or&#160;secure storage requirements. An individual may assert compliance with this bill as a claim or defense in any civil or criminal proceeding.</summary>
