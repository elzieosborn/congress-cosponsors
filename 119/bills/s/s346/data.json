The knife must be transported in\u00a0compliance with the bill's\u00a0accessibility and secure storage requirements, unless it is an emergency knife or tool designed to cut seat belts.\n\nAn individual who is transporting a knife in compliance with this bill may not be arrested or detained for a knife violation unless there is probable cause to believe the individual failed to comply with the accessibility or\u00a0secure storage requirements. An individual may assert compliance with this bill as a claim or defense in any civil or criminal proceeding."
