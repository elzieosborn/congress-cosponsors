    "text": "Defense of Conscience in Health Care Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue a final rule on protecting statutory conscience rights in health care that is identical or equivalent to the rule titled\u00a0Protecting Statutory Conscience\u00a0Rights in Health Care; Delegations of\u00a0Authority, which was scheduled to take effect on July 22, 2019, but was vacated by courts.\n\nFederal law\u00a0generally prohibits discrimination based on conscience or religious beliefs with respect to federally funded health care programs, including prohibiting recipients of certain federal funding from requiring health care providers\u00a0to take\u00a0actions that they find religiously or morally objectionable (e.g., providing\u00a0referrals for abortions).\u00a0\n\nIn 2019,\u00a0HHS issued a final rule revising the\u00a0applicable\u00a0regulations, including imposing certification and cooperation requirements, as well as establishing additional enforcement provisions and penalties. However, this rule was later\u00a0vacated by federal courts and never took effect. In 2024,\u00a0HHS issued another final rule that generally applied\u00a0a pre-2019 enforcement framework while also maintaining certain aspects of the 2019 rule (e.g., specifically designating HHS' Office for Civil Rights as the entity with the authority to handle relevant complaints).\n\nThe bill requires HHS to reinstate\u00a0the 2019 rule in its entirety."
