This bill&#160;abolishes the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in three years and directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to&#160;develop a reorganization plan for the TSA, which is subject to congressional approval.

DHS must submit a reorganization plan for the TSA to Congress within 90 days of the bill's enactment.

The reorganization plan must include

the establishment of the Office of Aviation Security Oversight within the Federal Aviation Administration;the rapid transfer of all aviation security activities and equipment to qualified private screening companies;any necessary changes to TSA's Screening Partnership Program, which currently allows commercial airports to use private screening companies for airport screening services;proportional reductions of operations and personnel until the transfer is complete; andthe transfer to the Department of Transportation of TSA&#160;functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities&#160;related to surface transportation&#160;(e.g., activities relating to mass transit and freight rail).The bill specifies that no employee of the new office shall conduct airport screening services.

Further, the plan may not include any agency requirement or regulation compelling private contractors conducting airport security screening services to conduct warrantless searches and seizures.

DHS must submit a progress report to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Congress within 60 days of the bill's enactment and every 30 days thereafter. The GAO must submit a report to Congress every 180 days detailing DHS's compliance with this bill.

In addition, the bill establishes a congressional review and approval process for the reorganization plan.</summary>
