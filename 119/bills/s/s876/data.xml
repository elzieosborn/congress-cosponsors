This bill provides continuing appropriations for military pay for any period during which interim or full-year appropriations for FY2025 are not in effect (i.e., a government shutdown).

Specifically, the bill provides FY2025 continuing appropriations for the pay and allowances of (1) members of the Armed Forces, including reserve components, who perform active service during the period; and (2) civilian personnel and contractors of the Department of Defense (and the Department of Homeland Security in the case of the Coast Guard) who are providing support to such members of the Armed Forces.

If a government shutdown occurs, the bill provides the continuing appropriations until the earlier of (1) the enactment into law of specified appropriations legislation, or (2) January 1, 2026.&#160;</summary>
