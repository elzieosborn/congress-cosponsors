    "text": "Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2025\n\nThis bill recognizes and settles certain water rights claims in New Mexico of the pueblo of Zuni and establishes and provides funding for a related settlement trust fund. It also requires federal actions related to the Zuni Salt Lake in New Mexico.\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes, ratifies, and confirms a specified water rights settlement agreement entered into by Zuni, New Mexico, and others, thus satisfying claims to water rights in the Zuni River Stream System in New Mexico.\n\nThe bill establishes and provides funding for the Zuni Tribe Settlement Trust Fund (and specified accounts) for purposes of carrying out this bill.\n\nAdditionally, the bill (1) specifies the water rights of the pueblo; and (2) outlines waivers, releases, and retentions of claims by the pueblo and the United States.\n\nThe bill also withdraws certain federal land in New Mexico from mineral development. The bill reserves this federal land for the following three purposes: (1)\u00a0the protection of the Zuni Salt\u00a0Lake and Sanctuary, (2) the protection of the quality and quantity of the Zuni Salt Lake's water supply, and (3) the protection of any cultural resources associated with the Zuni Salt Lake and Sanctuary. The Bureau of Land Management must manage this land.\n\nThe Department of the Interior must take certain land surrounding the Zuni Salt Lake into trust for the benefit of Zuni."
