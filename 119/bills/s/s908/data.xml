This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop and finalize a poultry vaccination strategy&#160;to address highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Specifically, USDA, in consultation with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, must develop an HPAI vaccination strategy that complies with World Trade Organization rules.

Avian influenza (i.e., bird flu) is a contagious viral disease of domesticated and wild birds. Depending on the viral strain, the disease can cause little to no signs of illness&#160;(referred to as low pathogenic avian influenza)&#160;or it can cause a range of symptoms from serious illness to death (referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI).&#160;</summary>
