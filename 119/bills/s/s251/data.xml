This bill excludes expenses paid for an abortion from qualified medical expenses eligible for reimbursement from certain tax-exempt savings accounts. (Some exceptions apply.)

Under the bill, amounts paid for an abortion, other than an excluded abortion, are not qualified medical expenses eligible for reimbursement from a health savings account, Archer medical savings account, health flexible spending arrangement, health reimbursement arrangement, or retiree health account.

The bill defines excluded abortion as any abortion (1) related to a pregnancy that is the result of rape or incest; or (2)&#160;performed because a woman is suffering from a physical disorder, injury, or illness (including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself) that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death if an abortion were not performed.</summary>
