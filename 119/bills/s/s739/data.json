    "text": "9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act of 2025\n\nThis bill modifies the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP), including by\u00a0updating the formula for determining the program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual funding amounts and authorizing mental health providers to provide certain evaluations under the program.\n\nThe\u00a0WTCHP is a federal health care program (terminating in FY2090) providing responders and survivors with monitoring and treatment of certified medical conditions related to the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. Under current law, the program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual federal funding is determined based on the amount specifically appropriated in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe bill establishes a new federal\u00a0funding\u00a0formula for\u00a0FY2026-FY2090 that is generally based on annual changes in the number of enrollees. The bill also increases the amounts the program may spend annually on medical research and activities relating to data collection. The bill requires the\u00a0National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which administers the program,\u00a0to submit a report to Congress on the program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projected budgetary needs and expenditures.\n\nIn addition, the bill authorizes licensed mental health providers to perform initial health evaluations with respect to\u00a0mental health conditions for purposes of determining eligibility under the WTCHP. NIOSH must issue regulations specifying the categories of mental health providers that may perform these activities."
