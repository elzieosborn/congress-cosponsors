  <summary date="2025-04-04T19:52:59Z" status="Introduced in Senate">9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act of 2025

This bill modifies the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP), including by&#160;updating the formula for determining the program&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s annual funding amounts and authorizing mental health providers to provide certain evaluations under the program.

The&#160;WTCHP is a federal health care program (terminating in FY2090) providing responders and survivors with monitoring and treatment of certified medical conditions related to the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. Under current law, the program&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s annual federal funding is determined based on the amount specifically appropriated in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for inflation.

The bill establishes a new federal&#160;funding&#160;formula for&#160;FY2026-FY2090 that is generally based on annual changes in the number of enrollees. The bill also increases the amounts the program may spend annually on medical research and activities relating to data collection. The bill requires the&#160;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which administers the program,&#160;to submit a report to Congress on the program&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s projected budgetary needs and expenditures.

In addition, the bill authorizes licensed mental health providers to perform initial health evaluations with respect to&#160;mental health conditions for purposes of determining eligibility under the WTCHP. NIOSH must issue regulations specifying the categories of mental health providers that may perform these activities.</summary>
