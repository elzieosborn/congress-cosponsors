  <summary date="2025-06-27T19:22:33Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Telework Reform Act of 2025

This bill establishes additional terms and conditions for executive agency telework&#160;policies. It also&#160;authorizes agencies to noncompetitively hire qualified covered veterans, military spouses, and spouses of law enforcement officers for remote telework (i.e.,&#160;full-time telework from an approved alternative worksite).

The bill&#160;provides, among other requirements, that agencies

limit telework agreements to a period of one year,review telework agreements at least annually,ensure that telework policies address the extent to which telework may be restricted based on performance or&#160;disciplinary action, and&#160;establish systems to confirm that employees are working&#160;solely at approved worksites.The bill also authorizes agencies to noncompetitively&#160;appoint veterans, military spouses, and spouses of law enforcement officers with appropriate qualifications to remote telework positions.&#160;The authority for hiring spouses of law enforcement officers is a seven-year pilot program.

Further, the bill requires the (1) Office of Management and Budget to issue guidelines to protect the security of information and systems used while teleworking, and (2) the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study comparing the processing time for constituent services provided by agencies as of the study's date with the average processing times in 2019.</summary>
