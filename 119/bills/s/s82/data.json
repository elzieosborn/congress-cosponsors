    "text": "Telework Reform Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes additional terms and conditions for executive agency telework\u00a0policies. It also\u00a0authorizes agencies to noncompetitively hire qualified covered veterans, military spouses, and spouses of law enforcement officers for remote telework (i.e.,\u00a0full-time telework from an approved alternative worksite).\n\nThe bill\u00a0provides, among other requirements, that agencies\n\nlimit telework agreements to a period of one year,review telework agreements at least annually,ensure that telework policies address the extent to which telework may be restricted based on performance or\u00a0disciplinary action, and\u00a0establish systems to confirm that employees are working\u00a0solely at approved worksites.The bill also authorizes agencies to noncompetitively\u00a0appoint veterans, military spouses, and spouses of law enforcement officers with appropriate qualifications to remote telework positions.\u00a0The authority for hiring spouses of law enforcement officers is a seven-year pilot program.\n\nFurther, the bill requires the (1) Office of Management and Budget to issue guidelines to protect the security of information and systems used while teleworking, and (2) the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study comparing the processing time for constituent services provided by agencies as of the study's date with the average processing times in 2019."
