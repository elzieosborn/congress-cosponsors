    "text": "Setting Manageable Analysis Requirements in Text Act of 2025 or the SMART Act of 2025\n\nThis bill requires agencies, when publishing a proposed or final major rule, to include a framework for assessing whether the rule achieves its regulatory objective. An agency must assess a rule in the time frame included in the framework. The assessment must compare the rule's anticipated and actual benefits and costs.\n\nAdditionally, the assessment must determine whether\u00a0(1) the rule has been rendered unnecessary because of changes to the subject area affected by the rule or it overlaps with, duplicates, or conflicts with other rules, or\u00a0state and local government regulations; (2)\u00a0the rule should be expanded, streamlined, or otherwise modified to accomplish the rule's objective; and (3) other alternatives or modifications to the rule could better achieve the rule's\u00a0objective.\u00a0\n\nThe bill defines a\u00a0major rule\u00a0as a rule likely to cause (1)\u00a0an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, health, safety, the environment, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.\u00a0"
