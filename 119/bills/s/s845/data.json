    "text": "Farmland Security Act of 2025\n\nThis bill\u00a0authorizes increased civil penalties for violations of the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 (AFIDA)\u00a0and increases Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversight of and research into foreign investment in agricultural land.\u00a0As background, AFIDA and the regulations that implemented the act require foreign investors who acquire, transfer, or hold an interest in U.S. agricultural land to report such holdings and transactions to USDA.\n\nIn general, the bill allows USDA to determine an appropriate civil penalty amount for an\u00a0AFIDA violation by removing the cap that currently\u00a0prohibits the civil penalty from exceeding 25% of the fair market value of the interest in the agricultural land\u00a0associated with the violation.\n\nUnder an exception in the bill, the civil penalty for a foreign-owned shell corporation is 100% of the fair market value of the interest in the agricultural land. The bill defines\u00a0a shell corporation to include a company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, trust, or estate that has no or nominal operations. The penalty does not apply if the shell corporation remedies a defective filing or failure to file within 60 days of USDA providing notice.\n\nUSDA must conduct annual compliance audits of at least 10% of the reports. Further, USDA must provide\u00a0state and county-level personnel certain annual training.\n\nUSDA must also annually conduct research and submit a report to Congress on foreign investment in agricultural land, including trends in the purchase of U.S. agricultural land by foreign-owned shell corporations."
