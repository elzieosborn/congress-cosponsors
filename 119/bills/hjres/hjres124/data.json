    "text": "This joint resolution nullifies the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) titled National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision\u00a0and issued on April 25, 2022. BLM's plan provides for the management of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, which is an approximately 23-million-acre area on Alaska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North Slope. The\u00a02022 plan replaced the 2020 plan and closed approximately 48% of the reserve to oil and gas leasing\u00a0in order to protect certain surface resources and uses, such as protecting wildlife and providing subsistence\u00a0for communities. Thus, the joint resolution removes the protections provided under the 2022 plan and reverts to the 2020 plan."
