  <summary date="2025-11-18T11:42:15Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution nullifies the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) titled National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision&#160;and issued on April 25, 2022. BLM's plan provides for the management of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, which is an approximately 23-million-acre area on Alaska&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s North Slope. The&#160;2022 plan replaced the 2020 plan and closed approximately 48% of the reserve to oil and gas leasing&#160;in order to protect certain surface resources and uses, such as protecting wildlife and providing subsistence&#160;for communities. Thus, the joint resolution removes the protections provided under the 2022 plan and reverts to the 2020 plan.</summary>
