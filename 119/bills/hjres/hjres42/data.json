Specifically, it modified certification requirements, labeling requirements, and enforcement provisions for these products and equipment to (1) align reporting requirements with currently applicable energy conservation standards and test procedures, and (2) provide DOE with the information necessary to determine the appropriate classification of products for the application of standards.\u00a0"
