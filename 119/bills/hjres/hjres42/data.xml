  <summary date="2025-03-04T20:18:04Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution nullifies the&#160;Energy Conservation Program for Appliance Standards: Certification Requirements, Labeling Requirements, and Enforcement Provisions for Certain Consumer Products and Commercial Equipment&#160;rule published by the Department of Energy (DOE) on October 9, 2024. Under the rule, DOE modified its regulations on the energy efficiency of certain types of&#160;consumer products (e.g., washing machines and dishwashers) and&#160;industrial equipment (e.g., computer room air conditioners). Specifically, it modified certification requirements, labeling requirements, and enforcement provisions for these products and equipment to (1) align reporting requirements with currently applicable energy conservation standards and test procedures, and (2) provide DOE with the information necessary to determine the appropriate classification of products for the application of standards.&#160;</summary>
