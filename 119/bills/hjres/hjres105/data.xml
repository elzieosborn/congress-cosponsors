  <summary date="2025-07-18T21:25:55Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution nullifies the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) relating to the Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan (RMP) for the North Dakota Field Office and issued on January 8, 2025.&#160;

By way of background, an RMP guides the management of lands administered by BLM. The 2025 North Dakota&#160;RMP modified the 1988&#160;RMP, including by limiting development of oil and gas in low-potential areas and new coal leasing to areas within four miles of existing mines.</summary>
