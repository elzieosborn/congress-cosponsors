The amendment specifies that the term limits do not apply to an individual who served in either chamber of Congress before the 118th Congress.\u00a0\n\nThe joint resolution provides that the amendment shall be valid when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states within seven years after the date of its submission for ratification.\u00a0\n\nUnder Article V of the Constitution, both chambers of Congress may propose an amendment by a vote of two-thirds of all Members present for such vote. A proposed amendment must be ratified by the states as prescribed in Article V and as specified by Congress."
