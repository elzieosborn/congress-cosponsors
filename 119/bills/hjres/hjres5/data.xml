  <summary date="2025-01-16T14:38:56Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the&#160;Constitution to limit terms in the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Specifically, the amendment limits an individual serving as a Member of the House of Representatives to six two-year terms and an individual serving as a Senator to two six-year terms. The amendment specifies that the term limits do not apply to an individual who served in either chamber of Congress before the 118th Congress.&#160;

The joint resolution provides that the amendment shall be valid when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states within seven years after the date of its submission for ratification.&#160;

Under Article V of the Constitution, both chambers of Congress may propose an amendment by a vote of two-thirds of all Members present for such vote. A proposed amendment must be ratified by the states as prescribed in Article V and as specified by Congress.</summary>
