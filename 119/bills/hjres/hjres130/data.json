Thus, the joint resolution requires the\u00a0BLM to follow the 2015 RMP as it was before it was amended in 2024 and make coal available for leasing.\n\nBy way of background, the BLM developed the amendment to the\u00a0plan in response to\u00a0Western Organization of Resource Councils v. Bureau of Land Management.\u00a0In that case, the court held that the BLM must evaluate the climate impacts of federal coal leasing in the Buffalo Field Office and include alternatives to limit or stop coal leasing in the evaluation in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act. After conducting the evaluation, the\u00a0BLM amended the RMP and made\u00a0BLM-managed coal resources in the Buffalo Field Office planning area unavailable for future leasing."
