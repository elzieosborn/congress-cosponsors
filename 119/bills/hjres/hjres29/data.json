    "text": "This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment to increase the number of times a person may be elected President.\n\nThe proposed amendment specifies that no person shall be elected to the office of the President (1) more than three times, (2) for any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms, or (3) more than twice after having served as President for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President (for example, if a President died after serving for one year and the Vice\u00a0President became President for the remaining three years of the term, that person may subsequently be elected President no more than two times).\n\nCurrently, under the Twenty-Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a person may not be elected President more than twice. Additionally, no person who has been President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President may be elected President more than once."
