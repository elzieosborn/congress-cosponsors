    <title type="official" as="introduced">A resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the 93rd anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-1933, known as the "Holodomor", should serve as a reminder of repressive Soviet policies against the people of Ukraine, and that Vladimir Putin's brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine once again threatens the existence of the Ukrainian people, while exacerbating the problems of global hunger.</title>
