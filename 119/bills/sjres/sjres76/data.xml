  <summary date="2025-11-19T15:24:07Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This joint resolution nullifies the rule issued by Environmental Protection Agency titled&#160;Extension of Deadlines in Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review Final Rule&#160;and published on July 31, 2025. The rule extended (1) certain deadlines for performance standards concerning control devices, equipment leaks, storage vessels, process controllers, and vent systems at crude oil and natural gas facilities; (2) the date for future implementation of the&#160;Methane Super&#160;Emitter Program; and (3) a state plan submittal deadline. Thus, the joint resolution restores the original deadlines that were applicable before the extensions made by the rule.</summary>
