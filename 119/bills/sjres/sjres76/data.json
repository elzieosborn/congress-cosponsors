The rule extended (1) certain deadlines for performance standards concerning control devices, equipment leaks, storage vessels, process controllers, and vent systems at crude oil and natural gas facilities; (2) the date for future implementation of the\u00a0Methane Super\u00a0Emitter Program; and (3) a state plan submittal deadline. Thus, the joint resolution restores the original deadlines that were applicable before the extensions made by the rule."
