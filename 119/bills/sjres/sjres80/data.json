The\u00a02022 plan replaced the 2020 plan and closed approximately 48% of the reserve to oil and gas leasing\u00a0in order to protect certain surface resources and uses, such as protecting wildlife and providing subsistence\u00a0for communities. Thus, the joint resolution removes the protections provided under the 2022 plan and reverts to the 2020 plan."
