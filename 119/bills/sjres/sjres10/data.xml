  <summary date="2025-02-20T19:52:04Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This joint resolution terminates the national emergency relating to energy declared by the President on January 20, 2025, in Executive Order 14156.

The executive order states that the supply of&#160;and infrastructure&#160;for energy in the United States is insufficient to meet the country's needs. It defines&#160;energy as&#160;crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates,&#160;natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the&#160;kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals.&#160;

The executive&#160;order directs the heads of executive departments and agencies to use available emergency and other authorities to take certain actions to address this topic, including approving development of domestic energy resources, expediting the completion of authorized energy infrastructure (particularly in the Northeast, West Coast, and Alaska), and pursuing the use of emergency permitting provisions under&#160;certain environmental regulations.

The executive order also directs the Department of Defense to conduct an assessment of its ability to acquire and transport energy resources (particularly in the Northeast and West Coast), and invokes emergency military construction authority to address any vulnerabilities identified in the assessment.</summary>
