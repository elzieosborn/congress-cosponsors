  <summary date="2025-11-03T15:09:44Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment that requires Members of Congress to forfeit their compensation during a government shutdown.&#160;

Specifically, the amendment provides that Members of Congress must forfeit (and may not receive) any compensation for their services during any period in which there is a lapse in appropriations as a result of a failure to enact regular or continuing appropriations for one or more federal agencies or departments (i.e., government shutdown).

Any funds that are forfeited under the amendment must be transferred to the Treasury and used to reduce the federal debt.&#160;</summary>
