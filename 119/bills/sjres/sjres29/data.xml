  <summary date="2025-05-13T16:49:55Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This joint resolution nullifies the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule titled Air Plan Approval; Ohio; Withdrawal of Technical Amendment (90 Fed. Reg. 6811) and published on January 21, 2025. Among other elements, the rule reversed a final rule from November 2020 that removed the Air Nuisance Rule (ANR) from the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP). The EPA determined its original action to remove the ANR was in error, and this rule reinstates the ANR. (Under the Clean Air Act, states must submit SIPs to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This ANR was included in Ohio&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s SIP.)</summary>
