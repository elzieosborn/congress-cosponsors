(Crowdfunding is used to raise capital through a large number of individuals investing potentially small amounts of money.) Under current law, crowdfunding issuers that have target offering amounts of $100,000 or less are not required to make available financial statements reviewed by an independent public accountant. The bill increases that amount to $250,000 and allows the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase this amount to no more than $400,000 upon recommendation of the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation and the Office of the Investor Advocate."
