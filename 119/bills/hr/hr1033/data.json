Specifically, ED must establish this program to appoint a monitor at an IHE that (1) has a high incidence of anti-Semitic activity (based on data received from ED's Office for Civil Rights), and (2) receives federal funds for higher education.\u00a0\n\nED must develop an anti-Semitism monitorship agreement that (1) designates the terms and conditions of the monitorship, and (2) requires the\u00a0IHE to provide for the monitor's reasonable expenses.\u00a0\n\nThe bill requires the monitor to\n\noperate under the monitorship agreement developed by ED and entered into with the IHE;\u00a0provide publicly available quarterly reports that evaluate the IHE's progress in combating\u00a0anti-Semitism on campus; andprovide annual reports to Congress, ED, state and local governments (as needed), and the IHE that include recommendations for actions, policies, and sanctions to prevent and reduce anti-Semitism at the IHE."
