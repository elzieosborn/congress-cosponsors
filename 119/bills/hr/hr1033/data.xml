This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to establish a program to appoint third-party anti-Semitism monitors at certain institutions of higher education (IHEs). Specifically, ED must establish this program to appoint a monitor at an IHE that (1) has a high incidence of anti-Semitic activity (based on data received from ED's Office for Civil Rights), and (2) receives federal funds for higher education.&#160;

ED must develop an anti-Semitism monitorship agreement that (1) designates the terms and conditions of the monitorship, and (2) requires the&#160;IHE to provide for the monitor's reasonable expenses.&#160;

The bill requires the monitor to

operate under the monitorship agreement developed by ED and entered into with the IHE;&#160;provide publicly available quarterly reports that evaluate the IHE's progress in combating&#160;anti-Semitism on campus; andprovide annual reports to Congress, ED, state and local governments (as needed), and the IHE that include recommendations for actions, policies, and sanctions to prevent and reduce anti-Semitism at the IHE.</summary>
