  <summary date="2025-07-23T18:29:23Z" status="Introduced in House">Hire Veterans Act

This bill requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a five-year pilot program&#160;to recruit veterans with relevant strengths and abilities and refer them to positions in federal land management agencies (e.g., the National Park Service).

OPM shall conduct tests of certain strengths and abilities for veterans participating in the program. After testing, federal land management agencies may offer non-competitive career-conditional appointments to such veterans demonstrating necessary strengths and abilities. Such agencies may also refer veterans not demonstrating sufficient strengths and abilities in the tests to training programs, and then re-administer such tests until the veteran qualifies for a non-competitive career-conditional appointment.</summary>
