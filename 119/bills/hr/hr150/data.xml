  <summary date="2025-02-27T22:03:49Z" status="Introduced in House">People-Centered Assistance Reform Effort Act or the People CARE Act

This bill establishes the People-Centered Assistance Reform Effort Commission within the legislative branch to review federal means-tested programs for potential reform.

Under the bill,&#160;means-tested programs are those designed to provide assistance to low-income individuals, including, for example, Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.&#160;The commission is generally directed to review all federal means-tested programs with the exception of certain specified programs, including Social Security, Medicare, and certain veterans&#226;&#8364;&#8482; benefits programs.

The commission is directed to identify and evaluate potential changes to federal means-tested programs, such as consolidation with other programs, delegation of certain functions to states, and the establishment of gradual benefit reductions tied to increases in beneficiaries&#226;&#8364;&#8482; income. The commission is also directed to consider changes that would allow&#160;caseworkers to identify all of the appropriate programs for individuals and families. The commission must establish a website through which members of the public may submit suggested reforms for consideration.&#160;

The commission is to be comprised of eight members, with an equal number of members&#160;appointed by the majority and minority parties. &#160;

At the conclusion of its term, the commission must report to Congress with its findings and proposed legislation implementing any recommended changes. Congress must consider the legislation under expedited procedures.</summary>
