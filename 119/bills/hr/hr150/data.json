The commission is also directed to consider changes that would allow\u00a0caseworkers to identify all of the appropriate programs for individuals and families. The commission must establish a website through which members of the public may submit suggested reforms for consideration.\u00a0\n\nThe commission is to be comprised of eight members, with an equal number of members\u00a0appointed by the majority and minority parties. \u00a0\n\nAt the conclusion of its term, the commission must report to Congress with its findings and proposed legislation implementing any recommended changes. Congress must consider the legislation under expedited procedures."
