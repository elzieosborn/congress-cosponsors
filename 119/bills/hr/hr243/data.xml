This&#160;bill prohibits federal officials and employees from taking any action, or expending any federal funds, to recognize or imply U.S. recognition of (1) Bidzina Ivanishvili, or (2) any government of the nation of Georgia that is led by Bidzina Ivanishvili or any proxies.

The bill also specifies that the United States must recognize the incumbent president of Georgia prior to the October 26, 2024, elections as the only legitimate leader of Georgia.

The President may declare this policy void if the chairman and co-chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission certify that Georgia has held free and fair elections.</summary>
