It requires the CDC to expand and intensify the activities of the NWSS, including with respect to SARS-CoV-2\u00a0(the virus that causes\u00a0COVID-19), influenza, mpox, dengue, West Nile virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0NWSS\u00a0provides funding and guidance to public health departments for wastewater surveillance activities.\u00a0Under the NWSS, health departments and other partners coordinate on wastewater\u00a0surveillance at sampling sites and share data with the CDC. The NWSS was initially\u00a0implemented\u00a0to monitor\u00a0SARS-CoV-2\u00a0and has since expanded to include influenza A, avian influenza A,\u00a0mpox, and RSV. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"
