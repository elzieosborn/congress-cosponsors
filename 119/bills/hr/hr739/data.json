    "text": "Salad Bars in Schools Expansion Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish and implement a plan, including through a five-year program of competitive grants, to promote the use of salad bars in schools participating in the school lunch program.\n\nPriority in the award of grants may be given to entities\u00a0(i.e., a school or a school food authority)\u00a0that (1) serve schools in which at least 50% of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, (2)\u00a0serve schools in food deserts, or (3) provide nutrition education to students. Under the bill, food desert is defined as a census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or a healthy, affordable food retail outlet.\n\nEligible entities must use the\u00a0grant funds to award schools a one-time payment for the anticipated cost of installing a salad bar, including the purchase of any required durable equipment.\n\nUSDA must also submit a report to Congress that includes recommendations\u00a0for promoting and establishing more salad bars in schools."
