    "text": "Pet Food Uniform Regulatory Reform Act of 2025 or the PURR Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) as the sole regulatory authority over pet food for dogs and cats. It also provides certain flexibilities for pet food manufacturers with respect to the types of ingredients they may use and the associated labeling and marketing\u00a0requirements.\n\nThe bill specifies that, with exceptions for certain existing oversight activities,\u00a0no state or local government may establish, implement, or enforce any authority or requirement relating to pet food marketing or labeling and instead provides for oversight by the CVM.\n\nThe bill requires the CVM to review and act on pet food ingredient submissions within 90 days.\u00a0Additionally, the bill provides a presumption that pet food ingredients are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) if they are recognized as acceptable per the Association of American Feed Control Officials and the\u00a0CVM does not find otherwise. Manufacturers may voluntarily notify the CVM of ingredients that are considered GRAS but that have not yet been specifically recognized as such.\n\nThe bill also allows manufacturers to state, without prior approval, that their products (1) sometimes, but not always, have certain ingredients (e.g., flavors); (2) have certain health benefits (e.g., tartar control); or (3) are human grade or natural, if certain conditions are met.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0"
