Specifically\n\nin courthouses with 10 or more active district judges, GSA must provide two courtrooms per 3 active district judges (except such courthouses may contain not less than 9 courtrooms for active district judges);in courthouses with 3 or more bankruptcy judges, GSA must provide one courtroom per 2 bankruptcy judges;in courthouses with 3 or more senior district judges, GSA must provide one courtroom per 2 senior district judges; andin courthouses with 3 or more magistrate judges, GSA must provide one courtroom per 2 magistrate judges.GSA is prohibited from constructing a new courthouse that does not comply with the courtroom sharing requirements. Additionally, if a new courthouse will add capacity in the GSA inventory, existing space in the same courthouse complex must be fully utilized or relinquished from such inventory.\n\nGSA must update the U.S. Courts Design Guide to reflect these requirements within 180 days after the bill's enactment.\u00a0(The Design Guide\u00a0sets forth the federal judiciary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirements for the design, construction, and renovation of court facilities and is intended for use by individuals involved in federal court construction projects.)"
