This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish the position of Women Farmers and Ranchers Liaison within USDA.

Among other things, the liaison must advocate on behalf of women who are farmers and ranchers in interactions with USDA employees and promote the advancement of women in USDA leadership roles. The liaison may also enter into a contract or cooperative agreement to conduct various research, training, and other activities with respect to women who are farmers and ranchers.

The liaison must submit an annual report to Congress on USDA grants, loans, loan guarantees, and cost-share programs for woman-owned agriculture operations.

In addition, the bill expands the USDA high-priority research and extension areas to authorize grants&#160;for developing and making widely available agriculture equipment and machinery that is ergonomically designed for use by women.

Further,&#160;USDA must give priority to certain loans or grants to address the availability, quality, or cost of childcare in an agricultural or rural community.</summary>
