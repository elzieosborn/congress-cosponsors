This bill&#160;adds classes of individuals protected&#160;under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

With respect to credit transactions, the bill adds sexual orientation, gender identity, and an applicant's location based on zip code or census tract as classes protected against discrimination. (Currently, discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because an applicant receives public assistance.)

The bill establishes criminal penalties for violations of prohibited credit discrimination.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is required to review loan applications for compliance with specified consumer laws and to establish an Office of Fair Lending Testing.</summary>
