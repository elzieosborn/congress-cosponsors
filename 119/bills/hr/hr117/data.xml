This bill repeals the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (which&#160;authorizes various types of searches and surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes) and limits surveillance of U.S. citizens.

The bill requires that an officer of the U.S. government obtain a warrant for certain search and surveillance activities against a U.S. citizen, including (1) conducting electronic surveillance, (2) conducting physical searches of property under a U.S. citizen's exclusive control, or (3) targeting a U.S. citizen to acquire foreign intelligence information.

The bill provides for criminal penalties for a person who intentionally (1) violates these requirements without statutory authorization, or (2) discloses or uses information that the person&#160;knows (or has a reason to know)&#160;was obtained under color of law by methods that violate these requirements.&#160;

Information about a U.S. citizen acquired under Executive Order 12333 (relating to intelligence gathering) or during surveillance of a non-U.S. citizen shall not be used against the U.S. citizen in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding or investigation.&#160;&#160;</summary>
