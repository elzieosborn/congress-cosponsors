This bill directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to collaborate with federal agencies&#160;regarding the use of shared-space arrangements in federally&#160;leased buildings.

The GSA must (1) collaborate with tenants of federally&#160;leased space to better identify concerns around shared-space arrangements; (2) develop criteria that would facilitate the expanded use of space sharing; (3) identify how special-use space can be used to improve space sharing; and (4) establish measurable objectives, in consultation with tenants, to quantify the success of shared-space arrangements among federal agencies.

GSA must brief Congress on implementation of the bill within six months after the bill's enactment.</summary>
