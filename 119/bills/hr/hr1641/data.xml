This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to disclose certain information related to career and technical education.

Specifically, the bill requires the Office of Federal Student Aid within ED to publish on its public website information on (1) career and technical education programs, including average completion time, program cost, and postgraduation employment rate; and (2) opportunities in each state to pursue these programs and obtain Perkins funding.

In addition, ED must include this information and a related acknowledgment signature box on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).</summary>
