This bill requires private institutions of higher education (IHEs) with specified assets or investments involving foreign countries or entities of concern&#160;to file annual investment disclosure reports. The bill applies to a private IHE with (1) assets in excess of $6 billion, or (2) investments of concern in excess of $250 million.&#160;

Specifically, the bill requires such a private&#160;IHE to file a disclosure report with the Department of Education (ED) for a year in which the IHE purchases, sells, or holds one or more investments of concern. Investment of concern means any specified interest (e.g., stock or debt) with respect to a foreign country of concern (e.g., North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran) or a foreign entity of concern (e.g., a foreign entity that is designated as a foreign terrorist organization).&#160;

Additionally, the bill requires ED to establish and maintain a publicly available and searchable database with these disclosure reports.

The bill requires&#160;ED to investigate possible violations of this bill and outlines the various penalties for each violation.&#160;Penalties may include losing eligibility for federal student financial aid.</summary>
