This bill provides for Medicare coverage of in-home administration of intravenous immune globulin to treat chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or multifocal motor neuropathy. (CIDP is an autoimmune condition that causes symptoms such as muscle weakness and numbness; multifocal motor neuropathy is a variant of CIDP that only causes asymmetric muscle weakness.)</summary>
