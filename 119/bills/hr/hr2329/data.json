    "text": "Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act\n\nThis bill addresses trade between the United States and\u00a0Uzbekistan.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes the President to determine that\u00a0Section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974 (commonly known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment) does not apply to Uzbekistan. The Jackson-Vanik amendment\u00a0denies normal trade relations (NTR) status to some current and former\u00a0nonmarket economy countries unless they comply with certain freedom-of-emigration requirements. Under a provision of this amendment, the President may\u00a0extend NTR status to a country affected by the amendment by waiving the freedom-of-emigration requirements or determining that the country is not in violation of those requirements, subject to an annual review.\u00a0Uzbekistan has received temporary NTR status since 1992.\n\nAdditionally, the bill authorizes the President to extend\u00a0permanent NTR status to Uzbekistan.\n\nThe bill shall take effect on the date on which the President certifies to Congress that Uzbekistan has acceded to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) and is a WTO member."
