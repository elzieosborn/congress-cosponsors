This bill provides for the awarding of the Purple Heart to veterans who experienced a traumatic brain injury on or after December 7, 1941, that is attributable to an act of an enemy of the United States. To be eligible, such veterans must have a service-connected disability attributable to the brain injury or have a military record demonstrating the occurrence of the brain injury.

The bill requires the military departments to (1) establish a process for persons to submit applications for the awarding of the Purple Heart to such veterans, and (2) award the Purple Heart to qualifying applicants regardless of the date of the brain injury.</summary>
