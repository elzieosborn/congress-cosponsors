Among other elements, this study must include the impact of mobile device use on student learning and academic achievement, student educational outcomes, and student mental health.\n\nSecond, the Department of Education, in consultation with HHS, must establish a pilot program to award grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to enable participating schools served by such LEAs to purchase secure containers and install lockers in order to create a school environment free of mobile devices."
