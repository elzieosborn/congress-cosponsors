This bill provides statutory authority for a research and development partnership between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Specifically, the bill requires DOE and NSF to enter into a memorandum of understanding to support cross-cutting and collaborative research and development that furthers the missions of both agencies. Through the partnership, DOE and NSF may conduct research in a variety of focus areas (e.g., artificial intelligence), promote multi-agency and cross-sector data sharing, support research infrastructure, and organize education and training initiatives.

DOE and NSF must jointly report on their collaboration.</summary>
