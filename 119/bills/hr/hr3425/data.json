Specifically, FPS shall (1) establish standards for the collection, maintenance, and analysis of covert testing data; (2) conduct quarterly analytical reviews of covert testing data to identify trends and opportunities for operational improvement; (3) establish a mandatory, cause-specific corrective training and performance improvement plan for any individual who fails a covert test; and (4) update security training guidance to address failed covert tests, emerging threats, and best practices. FPS must\u00a0report to Congress about implementation upon\u00a0completion and annually thereafter.\u00a0\n\nWithin\u00a0180 days after the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enactment, FPS must assess whether to replace or upgrade its tracking system for managing and monitoring the deployment availability of contract security personnel. FPS must\u00a0develop (1) an implementation plan that includes a timeline for the replacement or update;\u00a0and (2) procedures to ensure timely and accurate communication to building tenants regarding contract security personnel absences or other gaps in coverage.\u00a0FPS must report to Congress on the assessment within one year after the bill's enactment\u00a0and annually for the next three years."
