The GSA may establish exceptions to the fee schedule to be granted by agencies on a case-by-case basis,\u00a0provided the exceptions are competitively neutral with respect to the categories of individuals or entities granted exceptions and meet certain other requirements.\u00a0\n\nAgencies may only use fees collected to cover the costs of processing applications, and only\u00a0to the extent that\u00a0the funds are provided in advance in appropriations acts. \u00a0"
