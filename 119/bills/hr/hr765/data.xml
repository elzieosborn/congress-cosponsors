This bill requires the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to&#160;(1) establish a formal process for a local government official to request a new post office, and (2) modify how it communicates with local officials and the public about certain topics.

Specifically, USPS must modify existing regulations with respect to temporary relocations of postal retail services for holidays, special events, overflow business, and commemorative events. USPS may not implement any such temporary relocation for more than two days unless it first collects and considers community input. USPS must also provide specified notifications to local officials and the public, periodic updates to local officials, and a public presentation about such a relocation.</summary>
