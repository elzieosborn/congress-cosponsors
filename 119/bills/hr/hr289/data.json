Specifically, the bill amends Acer to require USDA to consider the information provided through consultation with the maple industry when making program grants.\n\nThe bill also extends the program's authorization through FY2030.\n\nAs background, Acer provides competitive grants to states, tribal governments, and research institutions to support their efforts to promote the domestic maple syrup industry through activities\u00a0associated with, among other things,\u00a0the promotion of (1) research and education related to maple syrup production, and (2) natural resource sustainability in the maple syrup industry."
