It also specifies that coverage includes an initial 10 hours of training until used, as well as an additional 2 hours of training per year. The bill also prohibits the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from limiting training that is deemed medically necessary.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must test a model in which such training is provided virtually and evaluate any effects on costs, services, and health outcomes."
