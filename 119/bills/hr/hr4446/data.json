The\u00a0program provides job training and employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities.\n\nCurrently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must formulate and annually review an individualized vocational rehabilitation plan for veterans who have a serious employment handicap and have a reasonably feasible vocational goal.\n\nThe bill provides that such plan must be redeveloped with the veteran if the VA determines the achievement of the long-range rehabilitation goals for the veteran are no longer feasible due to changes in the employment handicap of the veteran and are more likely under a different plan."
