  <summary date="2025-09-10T17:47:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Focused Assistance and Skills Training for Veterans' Employment and Transition Success Act or the FAST VETS Act

This bill establishes conditions under which a veteran's individualized vocational rehabilitation plan (under the Veteran Readiness and Employment program) must be redeveloped. The&#160;program provides job training and employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities.

Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must formulate and annually review an individualized vocational rehabilitation plan for veterans who have a serious employment handicap and have a reasonably feasible vocational goal.

The bill provides that such plan must be redeveloped with the veteran if the VA determines the achievement of the long-range rehabilitation goals for the veteran are no longer feasible due to changes in the employment handicap of the veteran and are more likely under a different plan.</summary>
