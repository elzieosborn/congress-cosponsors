    "text": "Continuing Appropriations and Extensions and Other Matters Act, 2026\n\nThis bill provides continuing FY2026 appropriations for federal agencies, permanently extends the expanded premium tax credit for purchasing health insurance, provides additional funding for Medicaid and security for federal officials, and extends various expiring programs.\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides continuing FY2026 appropriations to federal agencies through the earlier of October 31, 2025, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2026 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2026 begins on October 1, 2025.\n\nThe\u00a0CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2025 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs. For example, the CR provides additional funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and security for federal officials.\n\nIn addition, the CR\n\npermanently extends provisions that expanded the premium tax credit, which generally reduces premiums for health insurance purchased through a health insurance exchange;repeals health care provisions that were included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including\u00a0provisions that reduced Medicaid funding;\u00a0authorizes the District of Columbia to spend local funds at the rates included in its FY2026 local budget;extends the availability of certain funds that are being withheld by the Office of Management and\u00a0Budget (OMB); andlimits the authority of\u00a0OMB to withhold appropriations.Finally, the bill extends several expiring programs and authorities, including programs related to health care, veterans, homeland security, and agriculture. \u00a0"
