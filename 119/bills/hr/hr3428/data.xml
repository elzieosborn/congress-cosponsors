  <summary date="2025-09-08T15:48:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Mid-Atlantic River Basin Commissions Review Act

This bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review and report on the ethics policies, practices used to communicate with the public, and funding of the Mid-Atlantic River Basin Commissions. These commissions are the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Delaware River Basin Commission, and the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin.

The GAO must submit a report to Congress on (1) the findings of the review, and (2) any recommendations to increase the transparency or congressional oversight of the commissions.

Within 90 days of the GAO submitting its report,&#160;and annually thereafter for five years, each commission must submit to Congress a plan detailing actions the commission has taken to comply with the recommendations contained in the GAO's report.</summary>
