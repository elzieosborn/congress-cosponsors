    "text": "This bill modifies the Aquifer Recharge Flexibility Act to expand provisions concerning authorizations (e.g., rights-of-way) to transport water across public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for aquifer recharge purposes.\n\nUnder the Aquifer Recharge Flexibility Act, the holder of existing rights-of-way, easements, permits, or other authorizations to transport water across BLM land may transport the water for aquifer recharge purposes without additional authorization from the Department of the Interior so long as the use does not expand or modify the operation of such authorizations across public land.\n\nThe bill allows the holders of such authorizations to act not only on behalf of themselves, but also on behalf of states, Indian Tribes, or public entities, to use the existing authorizations for aquifer recharge without additional authorization from the Department of the Interior. Further, the bill states that this use may not be considered an expansion, modification, major federal action, or substantial deviation.\n\nAdditionally, the bill exempts holders from paying additional rents to the BLM for any use of such authorizations; however, the exemption does not apply to for-profit uses of aquifer recharge or for-profit entities.\u00a0\n\nFinally, holders of rights-of-way or other authorizations must provide notice to the\u00a0BLM of the intended use of authorization as specified by the bill."
