    "text": "Sergeant Ted Grubbs Mental Healthcare for Disabled Veterans Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish care or services under the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) to an eligible veteran with a service-connected mental disorder not later than five days after the veteran seeks care for such disorder. Current law requires the VA to establish access standards for furnishing hospital care, medical services, or extended care services under the VCCP to veterans who are (1) enrolled in the VA health care system, or (2) not enrolled but are in the 12-month period following their discharge from service and meet other requirements (e.g., having a service-connected disability).\n\nUnder the bill, the VA must modify its access standards for furnishing such care and services under the VCCP to require the provision of care or services not later than five days after an eligible veteran with a service-connected mental disorder rated at 50% or more seeks treatment for such disorder."
