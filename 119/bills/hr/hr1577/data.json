Specifically, if Treasury determines that a foreign financial institution, class of transaction, or type of account is of such concern, Treasury may require domestic financial institutions and agencies to take special measures, such as reporting certain financial transactions involving that entity or activity.\n\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) must issue advisories to financial institutions about how to identify Chinese money laundering that facilitates the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. FinCEN must also issue guidance to financial institutions for filing suspicious transaction reports related to suspected narcotics trafficking by transnational criminal organizations."
