    "text": "Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes procedures for delaying the redemption of certain securities if an investment company or agent believes\u00a0that an older individual or an individual with certain impairments has been financially exploited.\n\nSpecifically, the bill allows for the delay of the redemption of a security issued by an open-end investment management company and serviced by a transfer agent\u00a0if the company or agent reasonably believes the redemption involves the financial exploitation of an individual (1) age 65 or older, or (2) age 18 or older who is unable to protect his or her own interests due to a mental or physical impairment.\u00a0(Open-end investment management companies offer securities in pooled investment vehicles such as mutual funds. Transfer agents facilitate certain transactions for corporations and investment companies, including dividend distribution and change of securities ownership.)\n\nThe company may initially delay the redemption for up to 15 days and, upon making a determination of exploitation, may delay the redemption an additional 10 days. A state regulator, appropriate administrative agency, or court may extend this period.\u00a0In the event of delay, the company must hold the amounts related to the redemption in a demand deposit account.\u00a0The bill also establishes notification requirements.\u00a0\n\nThe bill requires the registered open-end investment company and transfer agent to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if they elect to comply with the procedures established under this bill.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, the SEC must make recommendations to address the financial exploitation of these adults."
