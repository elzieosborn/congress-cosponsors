An EGC is a type of issuer that qualifies for reduced disclosures after its initial public offering (IPO) if its annual gross revenues are below a specific dollar amount. For example, an EGC must currently provide two years of financial statements after its IPO, rather than the three required for other companies.\u00a0\n\nUnder the bill, an emerging growth company is not required to present certain financial statements from acquired companies. This applies to statements from the time period prior to the earliest audited period presented in connection with the EGC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IPO. In addition, the bill provides that no issuer that was formerly an EGC is required to present financial statements older than its earliest audit performed in connection with its IPO.\u00a0"
