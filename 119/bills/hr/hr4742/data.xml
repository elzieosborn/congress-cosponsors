  <summary date="2025-09-17T15:18:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Giving Increased Variety to Ensure Milk Into the Lives of Kids Act or the GIVE MILK Act 

This bill revises the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to allow WIC participants (or the parent or guardian of such participants) to elect to be issued nonfat milk, 1% low-fat milk, 2% reduced-fat milk, or whole milk.&#160;Current WIC regulations restrict the milk choices for most women and children who are at least two years old&#160;to nonfat or 1% milk, with exceptions.</summary>
