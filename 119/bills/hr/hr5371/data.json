    "text": "Continuing Appropriations, Agriculture, Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Extensions Act, 2026\n\nThis bill ends the government shutdown by providing FY2026 continuing appropriations for most federal agencies through January 30, 2026, and providing appropriations through the end of FY2026 for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs, and legislative branch programs. It also extends various expiring programs and authorities.\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides continuing FY2026 appropriations to most federal agencies through the earlier of January 30, 2026, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations act. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and ends the government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, because the FY2026 appropriations bills had not been enacted. The\u00a0CR funds most programs and activities at the FY2025 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.\n\nThe bill also provides back pay to all federal employees who were not paid during the government shutdown, prohibits federal agencies from taking actions related to a reduction in force (RIF) through January 30, 2026, and nullifies RIFs that were implemented by federal agencies between October 1, 2025, and the date of enactment for this bill.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the bill includes three regular FY2026 appropriations bills that fund the following agencies and activities though the end of FY2026:\u00a0\n\nthe Department of Agriculture,the Food and Drug Administration,\u00a0Department of Defense military construction and family housing activities,the Department of Veterans Affairs,Congress and agencies that support Congress, andseveral related and independent agencies.Finally, the bill extends several expiring authorities and programs, including authorities related to\u00a0\n\npublic health, Medicare, and Medicaid;cybersecurity;agriculture;Food and Drug Administration user fees;veterans benefits;actions to mitigate a threat from an unmanned aircraft system (i.e.,\u00a0drones); andthe Defense Production Act of 1950."
