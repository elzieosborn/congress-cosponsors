Under the bill, a family coordinator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s function is generally to serve at a VA medical center as a point person regarding VA and community resources for veterans, their families, and caregivers and survivors of veterans.\n\nThe VA may expand the program to additional medical centers as appropriate.\n\nNot later than one year after the date of enactment of this bill, and not less frequently than once every five years after, the VA must survey disabled veterans and their families to identify and better understand their needs."
