    "text": "Justice for Vaccine Injured Veterans Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes a presumption of service-connection for certain conditions that become manifest in a member of the Armed Forces who received a COVID-19 vaccine under orders any time from August 24, 2021, through January 10, 2023. Under a presumption of service-connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes a presumption of service-connection, regardless of whether there is a record of evidence of the condition during a servicemember's\u00a0period of service, for myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and any other condition the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determines is warranted based on a positive association with the COVID-19 vaccine. Under the bill, if the VA determines an additional condition should be specified, it must submit a notice of such determination to Congress.\n\nThe VA must also report to Congress every 60 days for four\u00a0years regarding claims for compensation related to a condition associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Such reports must be made publicly available."
