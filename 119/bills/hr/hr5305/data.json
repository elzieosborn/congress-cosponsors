It must be used to support official and representational duties and may not be used for personal or campaign purposes.\u00a0\n\nAnnual appropriations acts that fund the legislative branch have generally included a provision that requires unused amounts remaining in the\u00a0MRA to be used for deficit reduction or to reduce the federal debt. This bill makes this requirement permanent.\u00a0"
