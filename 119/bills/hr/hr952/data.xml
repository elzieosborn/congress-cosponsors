This bill directs the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to&#160;offer to sell the reversionary interest of the United States in approximately 8.43 acres of land in Sacramento, California, as generally depicted on a specified map dated November 7, 2022.&#160;Within two years of receiving a request from the owner of the land, the BLM must offer the reversionary interest and convey the reversionary interest to the buyer upon payment. The payment must be&#160;in an amount that is at least the fair market value of the reversionary interest. The buyer must also pay all costs related to the applicable conveyance of the reversionary interest, including all surveys, appraisals, and other administrative costs.

The bill subjects the conveyance to valid existing rights.

The proceeds from the sale must be deposited into Federal Land Disposal Account.</summary>
