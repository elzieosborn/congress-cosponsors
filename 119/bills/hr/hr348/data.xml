  <summary date="2025-05-22T19:19:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Corrupt Iranian Oligarchs and Entities Act

This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to report to Congress on certain individuals&#160;and entities&#160;in Iran that have&#160;close relationships with the Iranian government.

The report must include specified information, including (1) identifying senior foreign political figures and oligarchs in Iran, their known sources of income, and their non-Iranian business affiliations; (2) assessing the emergence of parastatal entities and their leadership structure; and (3) the potential effects of imposing sanctions or debt and equity restrictions on such oligarchs, parastatal entities, or Iranian state-owned enterprises.

For the purposes of this bill, an Iranian parastatal entity is one in which Iranian state ownership is at least 25% and that had revenues of at least $2 billion in 2016.</summary>
