Specifically, the bill removes the requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to issue the repayments with the last monthly housing stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This requirement has limited the repayments to individuals who are receiving stipends. Under the bill, the VA must make such a repayment before the exhaustion of the individual's entitlement to education assistance."
