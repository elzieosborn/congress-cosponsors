    "text": "Patient Matching And Transparency in Certified Health IT Act of 2025 or the MATCH IT Act of 2025\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a definition and standards for patient matching (i.e., the process of\u00a0accurately matching patients with their medical records, including when records are exchanged between health care providers). It also requires the development of\u00a0(1)\u00a0a minimum data set for technology standards\u00a0to increase patient matching, and (2) incentives for patient matching under Medicare.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires HHS to develop a uniform definition and standards for patient matching to track patient match rates and document improvement over time. The definition and standards must account for certain situations, including duplicate records and multiple matches.\n\nThe bill also requires the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to adopt a minimum data set to help health care providers or health information systems achieve\u00a0a patient match rate of 99.9%. The\u00a0minimum data set and related standards must be incorporated\u00a0into the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability and the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program\u00a0for\u00a0health information technology.\n\nAdditionally, the Centers for Medicare &\u00a0Medicaid Services (CMS) must\u00a0establish a voluntary bonus measure within the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program to allow\u00a0health care providers who have a patient match rate over a certain percentage to receive a payment adjustment.\u00a0The ONC and CMS\u00a0must develop a voluntary reporting program for providers to anonymously submit patient matching data to HHS.\u00a0"
