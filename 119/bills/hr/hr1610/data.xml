This bill expands the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program for fire departments and emergency medical services organizations to include cancer prevention programs (e.g., multi-cancer early detection testing)&#160;for firefighting personnel. It also establishes a joint cancer research program between FEMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#160;through which firefighting personnel may voluntarily share the anonymized results of preventative cancer testing so the CDC can study trends or causes of cancer in such personnel.</summary>
