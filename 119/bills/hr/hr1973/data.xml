This bill withholds or eliminates the pay of Members of Congress for any day that the public debt limit is reached or there is a government shutdown.

During the 119th Congress, any salary earned by Members during these events must be held in escrow and released on the last day of that Congress. For subsequent Congresses, a Member shall not be paid for any day that these events occur. (Some exceptions apply.)</summary>
