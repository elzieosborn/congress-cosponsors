This bill eliminates the authority of Congress to nullify recently enacted laws of the District of Columbia (DC).

Current law generally provides Congress with a 30-day period in which to review and nullify measures enacted by the DC Council (60 days for measures involving criminal law).&#160;An enacted measure is nullified if Congress passes and&#160;the President signs a joint resolution of disapproval. If there is no congressional action during the review period, the measure becomes law.

The bill eliminates this&#160;congressional review period and process.</summary>
