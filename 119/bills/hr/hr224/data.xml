  <summary date="2025-02-06T22:37:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Disabled Veterans Housing Support Act

This bill excludes compensation received&#160;for a military service-connected disability from a veteran's income when determining eligibility for assistance under the&#160;Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)&#160;program.

The CDBG program provides grants to urban communities for development activities focused on revitalizing neighborhoods, economic development, and providing improved community facilities and services.

Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on how service-connected disability compensation is treated when determining eligibility for all programs administered by&#160;the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This includes identifying instances where the treatment of such compensation is inconsistent with the requirement under this bill.</summary>
