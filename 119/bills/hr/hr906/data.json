After that information is obtained, the FCC must add to the published list any such entity in which a covered entity holds a specified voting or equity interest.\u00a0\n\nUnder the bill, a covered entity is defined as an entity organized in China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia; a subsidiary of such an entity; or the government of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia."
