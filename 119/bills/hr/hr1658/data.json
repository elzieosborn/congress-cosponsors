    "text": "Stopping Abuse and Fraud in Electronic Lending Act of 2025 or the SAFE Lending Act of 2025\n\nThis bill creates additional consumer protections applicable to certain credit and\u00a0banking transactions, including matters concerning remotely created checks, electronic fund transfers, registration of small-dollar lenders, overdraft fees, and the collection of personal information.\n\nUnder the bill, remotely created checks may only be issued by a person specifically designated in writing by a consumer.\u00a0The consumer must\u00a0provide the designation to the consumer's depository institution. (A remotely created check is a check not issued by the bank and not signed by the account owner.)\n\nA voluntary agreement to repay a small-dollar consumer credit transaction by an electronic fund transfer is subject to certain protections, including the right of the consumer to stop payment.\n\nSmall-dollar consumer credit providers must register with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Any small-dollar consumer credit transaction is subject to the laws of the state in which the consumer resides.\n\nThe bill also prohibits overdraft fees on prepaid accounts."
