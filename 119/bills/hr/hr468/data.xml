This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student aid programs to establish policies for awarding posthumous degrees.

Specifically, the IHE must certify that it has a policy to award a posthumous degree to a deceased student who (1) was enrolled in a degree program at the IHE; (2) died prior to completing such program; and (3) at the time of death, was in academic standing consistent with the requirements for graduation from such program (as determined by the IHE).

The bill prohibits accrediting agencies from taking into consideration the number of posthumous degrees awarded to deceased students by the&#160;IHE. (Under current law, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency to participate in federal student aid programs.)</summary>
