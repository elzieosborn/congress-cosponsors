This bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of political affiliation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other participating entities (i.e., public or private entities providing or receiving assistance) in carrying out federal major disaster or emergency relief and assistance activities.

Current law requires&#160;FEMA and other participating entities to provide federal major disaster or emergency relief and assistance without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age, disability, English proficiency, or economic status. The bill adds political affiliation to the classes protected under this requirement.&#160;</summary>
