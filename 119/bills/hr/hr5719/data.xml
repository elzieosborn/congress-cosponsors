  <summary date="2025-10-23T15:10:47Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides continuing appropriations to the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts for any year in which the commissions were funded in the prior fiscal year and appropriations have not otherwise been provided to the commissions for the current fiscal year.&#160;

The bill provides the appropriations at the rate and under the&#160;terms and conditions that were provided for the previous fiscal year. The continuing appropriations would exempt the commissions from a government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations for the federal government.</summary>
