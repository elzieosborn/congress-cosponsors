This bill grants certain authorities to the President for entering into a comprehensive trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom (UK).

The bill authorizes the President to enter into a comprehensive trade agreement with the UK, with such authority expiring on March 1, 2029. Further, the President may proclaim a modification or continuance of any existing duty or a continuance of existing excise or duty-free treatment to carry out an agreement, with certain limitations.
