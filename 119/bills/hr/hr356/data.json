Generally, the local Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia prosecutes crimes committed by juveniles and criminal violations of municipal regulations, and the federal\u00a0U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia prosecutes all other crimes.\n\nThe bill also specifies that current employees of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia who continue to be employed by the local prosecutor's office retain their eligibility as federal employees for purposes of health insurance, retirement, and\u00a0other federal benefits."
