    "text": "Standing with Moms Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to disseminate information about pregnancy-related resources, including information about abortion risks and alternatives.\n\nSpecifically, HHS must create a public website called life.gov that lists such resources that are available through federal, state, and local governments and private entities.\n\nAdditionally, HHS must create\u00a0on its existing\u00a0website a portal that provides a user, based on the user's responses to a series of questions, tailored information about pregnancy resources available in the user's zip code and risks related to abortion. HHS must develop a plan to conduct follow-up outreach to users of the portal (if the user consents to the outreach). States must recommend resources that meet criteria set by HHS for\u00a0inclusion in the portal. HHS may award grants to states to establish or support a system that aggregates resources to include in the portal.\n\nFurther, the Health Resources and Services Administration must share information about the new website\u00a0and portal through the National\u00a0Maternal Mental Health Hotline.\n\nHHS must also ensure that the new\u00a0website and hotline are available to families who speak languages other than English.\n\nThe new website, portal, and hotline may not include resources provided by entities that (1) perform, induce, refer for, or counsel in favor of abortions; or (2) financially support such entities.\n\nThe bill also requires HHS to report on traffic to the new website\u00a0and portal, gaps in services available to pregnant and postpartum individuals, and related matters."
