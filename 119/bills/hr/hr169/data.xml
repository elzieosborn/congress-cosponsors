This bill establishes a new business tax credit on the sale of a safe firearm storage device on or before December 31, 2032.&#160;

The amount of the tax credit is 10% of the retail sales price (up to a maximum price of $400 and excluding separately stated sales tax) of a safe firearm storage device. The tax credit is allowed only on the first retail sale of a safe firearm storage device for a use other than resale or long-term lease.

The bill defines safe firearm storage device as a device that is (1) designed and marketed to deny unauthorized access to a firearm or ammunition or render such items inoperable;&#160;and (2) is secured by a combination lock, key lock, or lock based on biometric information.
