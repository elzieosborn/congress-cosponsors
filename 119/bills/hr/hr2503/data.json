For the purposes of this bill, a foreign adversary is any foreign government or nongovernment person (entity or individual) engaged in certain conduct that significantly and adversely affects U.S. national security.\n\nWithin one year of the bill's enactment,\u00a0the President must seek to enter into agreements with allies and partners to prevent such items from being available to foreign adversaries.\n\nFurthermore, Commerce must determine the appropriate level of export and transfer controls for such items under the Export Administration Regulations.\n\nThe bill also requires Commerce to develop a strategy to prevent such items from being available to foreign adversaries. The President must report annually to Congress on this strategy."
