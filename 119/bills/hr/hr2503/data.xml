  <summary date="2025-09-02T15:09:28Z" status="Introduced in House">Undersea Cable Control Act

This bill requires the President and the Department of Commerce to take certain actions to prevent foreign adversaries from acquiring items needed to support the construction, maintenance, or operation of undersea cable projects. For the purposes of this bill, a foreign adversary is any foreign government or nongovernment person (entity or individual) engaged in certain conduct that significantly and adversely affects U.S. national security.

Within one year of the bill's enactment,&#160;the President must seek to enter into agreements with allies and partners to prevent such items from being available to foreign adversaries.

Furthermore, Commerce must determine the appropriate level of export and transfer controls for such items under the Export Administration Regulations.

The bill also requires Commerce to develop a strategy to prevent such items from being available to foreign adversaries. The President must report annually to Congress on this strategy.</summary>
