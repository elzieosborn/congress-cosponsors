This bill permits the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to enter into an agreement to reimburse the town of Chincoteague, Virginia for costs directly associated with the removal and relocation of drinking water wells currently situated on NASA property. &#160;

(Drinking water wells located at NASA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Wallops Flight Facility near Chincoteague have tested positive for perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, resulting from the use of certain firefighting foams at the site beginning in the 1970s. NASA currently operates a water treatment system to remove PFAS from the affected water supply.)&#160;

Any such agreement must include, to the extent practicable, (1) a provision for the removal and relocation of the wells remaining on NASA property, (2) a description of the location to which the wells are planned to be relocated, and (3) a current cost estimate of such relocation. Replacement wells must be established on property under the administrative control of the town of Chincoteague.&#160;</summary>
