This bill reauthorizes through FY2031 and expands the Teacher Quality Partnership program (which provides grants to improve the quality of teachers and enhance professional development activities).

Specifically, the bill expands the program&#160;to include training and professional development opportunities for principals and other school leaders.

Currently under the program, eligible partnerships must be comprised of (1) a high-need local educational agency; (2) a high-need school or early childhood education program; (3) a partner institution; and (4) certain schools, departments, or programs within a partner institution. The bill requires these partnerships, in their preparation or residency programs, to use evidence-based methods and adhere to an evaluation plan that includes comprehensive performance objectives.

Additionally, the bill authorizes grants&#160;for the establishment of professional development programs for teachers who remain in the classroom while also carrying out formalized leadership responsibilities.

The bill also establishes an advisory committee within the Department of Education to conduct a feasibility study that, among other things, compiles best practices for educating and training profession-ready teachers and school leaders.</summary>
