This bill extends for one year the energy investment tax credit for qualified biogas property (property that converts biomass into methane and captures the gas for sale or productive use).

Under the bill, the energy investment tax credit (as part of the general business tax credit) is allowed for investments in qualified biogas property for which construction begins on or before December 31, 2025. (Under current law, to qualify for the tax credit, construction of qualified biogas property must begin on or before December 31, 2024.)</summary>
