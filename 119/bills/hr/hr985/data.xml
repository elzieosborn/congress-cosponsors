  <summary date="2025-03-24T19:00:21Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill increases the authorization of appropriations for the Dairy Business Innovation&#160;(DBI) Initiatives for each fiscal year.&#160;The bill also requires that there be a minimum of four regionally-located DBI&#160;Initiatives, instead of the currently required three.

Under the Agricultural Marketing Service, the DBI Initiatives support dairy businesses in the development, production, marketing, and distribution of dairy products. The current program includes four DBI Initiatives selected to&#160;provide direct technical assistance and subawards to dairy businesses, including for niche dairy products and dairy products derived from cow milk, sheep milk, and goat milk.</summary>
