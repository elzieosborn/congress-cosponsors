    "text": "Don't Cut FAA Workers Act of 2025\n\nThis bill prohibits the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from carrying out a mass layoff within one\u00a0year of a major aviation accident\u00a0(i.e., an aircraft accident in which a fatal aviation injury occurs), unless the FAA receives congressional approval.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the FAA must notify Congress of plans to carry out or\u00a0facilitate a mass layoff following a major aviation accident. The notification must\u00a0include\u00a0the number and type of employees proposed to be laid off. The FAA may only carry out the layoff if Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the proposal no later than 60 days after receiving the notification.\n\nUnder the bill, a\u00a0mass layoff means a reduction in force or other termination of employment that results in a personnel loss during any 90-day period of (1) 10 or more FAA employees at a single\u00a0employment site; or (2) 250 or more FAA employees, irrespective of the employment site."
