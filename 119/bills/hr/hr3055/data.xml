This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop and make public the Veteran to Supply Chain Employee Action Plan. Among other elements, the plan must identify (1) barriers and challenges of members of the Armed Forces who are eligible for counseling under the Transition Assistance Program and veterans in searching or training for employment in the supply chain industry, and (2) challenges that supply chain employers face when recruiting, hiring, or retaining veterans and such members of the Armed Forces.

The plan must also recommend specific short- and long-term actions that DOT, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Department of Labor can take to help veterans and such members of the Armed Forces in becoming supply chain employees.</summary>
