  <summary date="2025-04-22T14:21:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Post-Disaster Reforestation and Restoration Act of 2025

This bill directs the Department of the Interior to carry out a program for post-disaster reforestation and restoration.&#160;

Interior must identify covered lands requiring reforestation and restoration following unplanned disturbances that are unlikely to experience natural regeneration without assistance. Covered land means (1) any federal land or interest in land administered by the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Forest Service, or the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and (2) any Indian Forest Land or Rangeland.

Interior must propose a list that prioritizes&#160;projects for reforestation and restoration for each fiscal year. Interior may (1) carry out priority projects through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements; and (2) support any grant contract or cooperative agreement that may be necessary to ensure adequate and appropriate seed and seedling availability to further the objectives of priority projects.</summary>
