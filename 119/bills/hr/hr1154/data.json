Under current law, critical infrastructure means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\n\nDHS must issue guidance with respect to the designation, in which it must define the scope of the sector and name a federal agency to serve as the federal interface for the prioritization and coordination of activities specific to the sector, among other duties.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also adds the space systems, services, and technology sector to a list of critical infrastructure sectors that DHS must consider in allocating certain national security grants."
