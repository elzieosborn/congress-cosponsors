    "text": "Railroad Responsibility Act of 2025\n\nThis bill provides states with the authority to adopt or enact any law, regulation, order, or other requirement limiting the duration that a railroad carrier may block a grade rail crossing. Specifically, this bill states that federal transportation laws do not preempt a state from adopting or enacting these limits.\u00a0\n\nAs background, state and federal courts have generally found that state laws regarding obstructed crossings are preempted by one or more federal laws, thereby\u00a0rendering the state laws\u00a0unenforceable."
