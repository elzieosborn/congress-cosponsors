    "text": "Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 or the CLARITY Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes a regulatory framework for digital commodities, defined by the bill as digital assets that rely upon a\u00a0blockchain for their value.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission must generally regulate digital commodities transactions, including digital commodity exchanges, brokers, and dealers. To qualify for trade on an exchange (1) a digital commodity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blockchain must be mature, or on a blockchain system that has achieved decentralized control as defined by the bill; or (2) the issuer of the digital commodity must file certain reports. The bill establishes requirements for trade monitoring, recordkeeping, and the commingling of customer assets. \u00a0\n\nThe bill exempts digital commodities on mature\u00a0blockchains (and\u00a0digital commodities on blockchains expected to mature within certain timeframes)\u00a0from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration requirements if annual sales fall under a certain amount and other requirements are met. The bill provides the SEC with jurisdiction over digital commodity activities and transactions engaged in by certain brokers and dealers on alternative trading systems and by national securities exchanges.\u00a0\n\nDigital commodity exchanges, brokers, and dealers are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act for anti-money laundering and related purposes.\n\nThe bill also sets forth requirements for alternative trading systems, previously issued digital commodities, and provisional registration until the bill is implemented. \u00a0\n\nFor more information on this bill, see CRS Insight IN12583, Crypto Legislation: An Overview of H.R. 3633, the CLARITY Act."
