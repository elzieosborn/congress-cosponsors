  <summary date="2025-06-11T15:38:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Protect Social Security and Medicare Act

This bill requires a two-thirds vote before Congress may consider legislation that would reduce retirement, health, or other benefits administered by the Social Security Administration or the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.

Specifically, such legislation may not be considered in either chamber of Congress until two-thirds of Members present and voting agree to a motion to consider the legislation. However, this restriction does not apply to legislation that reduces payments to Medicare Advantage plans so long as it also increases, in an amount equal to or greater than the reduction, payments made for other purposes under Medicare.</summary>
