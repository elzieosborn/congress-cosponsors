This bill limits Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s (ICE&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s) Alternatives to Detention program, which supervises&#160;non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) subject to removal who are released from the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Specifically, releases under this program are prohibited unless all detention beds are filled and DHS found no alternatives after exercising and exhausting all reasonable options.

The bill requires all individuals on ICE&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s nondetained docket to be enrolled in the program and be subject to continuous GPS monitoring and curfew.

Further, the bill requires a&#160;non-U.S. national who was arrested and released to be removed in absentia if an immigration officer submits an affidavit to an immigration judge stating that the individual failed to comply with a condition of release.</summary>
