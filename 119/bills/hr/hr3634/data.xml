  <summary date="2025-07-31T16:55:51Z" status="Introduced in House">Interactive Federal Review Act

This bill revises the environmental review process for federal-aid highway projects to encourage the use of certain digital platforms and models.

Specifically,&#160;the Department of Transportation (DOT) must encourage recipients of federal highway funding who are carrying out environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to utilize&#160;(1)&#160;interactive, digital, cloud-based platforms;&#160;and (2)&#160;high fidelity, three-dimensional digital models of infrastructure project elements, such as digital twins.&#160;

DOT must also&#160;select at least 10 federal-aid highway projects to demonstrate the use of&#160;these platforms and&#160;models&#160;in carrying out the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes required under&#160;NEPA.

Further, DOT must publish technology-neutral best practice guidance to encourage sponsors of projects that receive federal funds from DOT to use these platforms and&#160;models&#160;in carrying out the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes required under NEPA.</summary>
