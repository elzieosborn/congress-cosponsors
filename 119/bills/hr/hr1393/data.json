    "text": "Wildfire Response Improvement Act\n\nThis bill expands certain wildfire management assistance to beyond the time when the fire occurs and requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to update various programmatic guidance relating to wildfire response and cost-effectiveness criteria for wildfire mitigation projects.\n\nCurrently, in general, government entities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs for fighting wildfires are only eligible for assistance under the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) Program if the costs are incurred during the incident period (i.e., time during which the fire occurs). The bill requires\u00a0FEMA to modify the FMAG\u00a0Program so that assessments and emergency stabilization to protect public safety are eligible for FMAG assistance regardless of when the incident period begins or ends.\n\nThe bill also requires\u00a0FEMA to review and update its evaluation criteria for the cost-effectiveness of wildfire mitigation projects proposed under the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program or Hazard Mitigation Grant Program and prioritize projects accordingly.\n\nAdditionally,\u00a0FEMA must update its policy guide for the Public Assistance program to include guidance on challenges with wildfire recovery, including the resulting toxicity of drinking water resources."
