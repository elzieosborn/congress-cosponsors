    "text": "Reliability for Ratepayers Act\n\nThis bill modifies provisions concerning the hiring and compensation of employees of the\u00a0Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which is a nonprofit federal power marketing\u00a0administration that sells hydropower in the Northwest.\n\nSpecifically, it directs BPA\u00a0to develop and implement a\u00a0plan that specifies and fixes the compensation for its employees, including members of the Senior Executive Service. Within a year, BPA must develop an initial compensation plan, which must be approved by the Department of Energy. BPA must implement the plan no later than one year after the plan is developed.\n\nThe compensation plan must be based on an annual survey of the prevailing compensation for similar positions in the public sectors of the electric industry, provide compensation that is competitive with\u00a0similar positions among consumer-owned utilities in the Western Interconnection, be consistent with BPA's approved annual general and administrative budget, and meet other criteria as outlined in the bill.\u00a0\n\nBPA must (1) annually review the compensation plan and make any updates as appropriate, and (2) publish the plan and any updates made to the plan.\n\nThe bill exempts\u00a0BPA\u00a0from certain civil service laws when it is carrying out its hiring authority.\n\nFinally, the bill subjects BPA's employees\u00a0to certain merit system principles."
