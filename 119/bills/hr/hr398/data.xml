This bill expands the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to give the Department of the Interior the authority to collect certain fees from&#160;applicants for, or holders of, geothermal leases through September 30, 2032. Specifically, Interior may direct those applicants or&#160;leaseholders to reimburse the United States for costs from (1) processing applications for geothermal leases on federal land, such as applications for geothermal drilling permits; and (2) inspecting and monitoring geothermal exploration and development activities, including reclamation activities.

Interior may reduce the amount of the fee if it determines that (1) the full reimbursement would impose an economic hardship on the applicant, or (2) a less than full reimbursement is necessary to promote the greatest use of geothermal resources.

Interior&#160;may use those fees only&#160;to the extent that they are provided in advance in appropriations acts&#160;for (1) processing applications for geothermal leases, and (2) inspecting and monitoring related&#160;exploration and development activities.

Within five years of the bill's enactment, Interior must submit to Congress a report that includes an assessment of how the fees affect Interior's geothermal leasing program and any recommendations for updates to the fees and the program.&#160;</summary>
