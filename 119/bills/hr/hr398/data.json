    "text": "Geothermal Cost-Recovery Authority Act of 2025\n\nThis bill expands the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to give the Department of the Interior the authority to collect certain fees from\u00a0applicants for, or holders of, geothermal leases through September 30, 2032. Specifically, Interior may direct those applicants or\u00a0leaseholders to reimburse the United States for costs from (1) processing applications for geothermal leases on federal land, such as applications for geothermal drilling permits; and (2) inspecting and monitoring geothermal exploration and development activities, including reclamation activities.\n\nInterior may reduce the amount of the fee if it determines that (1) the full reimbursement would impose an economic hardship on the applicant, or (2) a less than full reimbursement is necessary to promote the greatest use of geothermal resources.\n\nInterior\u00a0may use those fees only\u00a0to the extent that they are provided in advance in appropriations acts\u00a0for (1) processing applications for geothermal leases, and (2) inspecting and monitoring related\u00a0exploration and development activities.\n\nWithin five years of the bill's enactment, Interior must submit to Congress a report that includes an assessment of how the fees affect Interior's geothermal leasing program and any recommendations for updates to the fees and the program.\u00a0"
