    "text": "IDs for an Inclusive Democracy Act\n\nThis bill directs the Social Security Administration (SSA) to produce and make available at no cost to individuals over the age of 14 a\u00a0means of\u00a0identification (ID) sufficient to satisfy certain identification requirements (i.e., requirements otherwise satisfied by a driver's license or state ID).\n\nThe ID must include a photograph, specified information, and certain security features, and must generally be valid for 10 years.\n\nSSA must develop and implement a campaign to educate the public about the ID, including how an individual can obtain and use one.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service (USPS)\u00a0must develop and implement a process that enables individuals to apply for and renew an ID through USPS, modeled after the process for passport applications.\n\nThe bill also establishes a task force to set forth requirements for the production and distribution of the new IDs. The task force must (1) issue a report outlining such requirements, including procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of any information obtained from applicants seeking assistance with the ID process; and (2) develop and publish voluntary best practices for nonprofit organizations and entities that serve vulnerable populations on assisting individuals with the application process."
