This bill specifies when separate occurrences of securities law violations must be considered as a single violation for purposes of calculating penalties. Specifically, separate occurrences must be counted as a single violation when the acts in question are the result of (1) a common or a substantially overlapping cause, (2) the same misstatement or omission, or (3) a continuing failure to comply.

The bill applies to various violations of securities law, including those involving the registration, offer, and sale of securities; and the conduct of brokers, dealers, and investment advisers.</summary>
