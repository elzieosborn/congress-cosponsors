The rule specifies that laboratory developed tests&#160;(medical screening tests developed by laboratories rather than medical device manufacturers) are medical devices subject to FDA regulation with limited exceptions. Prior to the rule, the FDA had exercised discretion as to whether to apply regulations for medical devices to laboratory developed tests.</summary>
