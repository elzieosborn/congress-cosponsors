A\u00a0critical energy resource means an energy resource (1) that is essential to the energy sector and energy systems of the United States, and (2) the supply chain of which is vulnerable to disruption.\n\nAs part of its duties, DOE must\u00a0conduct ongoing assessments of\n\nenergy\u00a0resource criticality,the U.S. supply chain of critical energy resources and its vulnerabilities,\u00a0the diversity of domestic critical energy resource supply chains,capacity constraints on the domestic production of critical energy resources,federal regulations affecting the domestic production or importation of critical energy resources,\u00a0how energy security is affected by reliance on imports of\u00a0critical energy resources, and\u00a0how adversarial nations seek\u00a0to exploit critical energy resource markets to undermine investment in the United States.DOE must also\n\nfacilitate the\u00a0development of strategies to\u00a0strengthen\u00a0critical energy resource supply chains,develop substitutes and alternatives to critical energy resources, andimprove technology that reuses and recycles critical energy resources."
