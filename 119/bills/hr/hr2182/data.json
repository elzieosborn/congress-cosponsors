    "text": "Pre-Pilot Pathway Act \n\nThis bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish an apprenticeship program with flight training providers (e.g., flight schools) in order to establish a commercial pilot pipeline; DOT must issue any necessary regulations to implement the program within one year of the bill's enactment.\n\nEach flight training provider participating in the program may select up to eight applicants (or more applicants based on a determination by DOT) per academic year to serve as apprentices.\n\nDOT must take appropriate actions to develop methods to incentivize pilots, including retired pilots, to become flight school instructors, mentors, or program advisors at participating flight training providers. This includes developing pathway programs for pilots to gain initial qualifications or concurrent qualifications as certified flight instructors.\n\nFurther, DOT must conduct an annual review of the apprenticeship program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effectiveness, including the impact on addressing pilot shortages."
