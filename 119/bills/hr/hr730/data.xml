  <summary date="2025-03-17T22:09:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act

This bill requires the National Science Foundation (NSF) to take certain actions to increase mathematical and statistical modeling education in elementary and secondary schools.

First, the NSF must make competitive awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations for research and development to support high-quality mathematical modeling education (e.g., data science and computational thinking) in schools. This authority to provide awards expires on September 30, 2029.

Second, the NSF must seek to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study and report on mathematical and statistical modeling education in schools.</summary>
