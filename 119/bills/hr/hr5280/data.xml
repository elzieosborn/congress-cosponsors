This bill amends the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program to allow the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide for certain restoration activities.&#160;The EWP Program offers technical and financial assistance, including the purchase of floodplain easements, to safeguard people and property from floods, drought, fires, windstorms, and other natural disasters that impair a watershed.

Under the bill, USDA may&#160;allow restoration above pre-disaster conditions if that restoration is in the best interest of the long-term health and protection of the watershed.</summary>
