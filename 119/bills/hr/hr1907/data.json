    "text": "Defense Against Drones Act of 2025\n\nThis bill allows an individual to shoot an unmanned aircraft (i.e., drone) using a legally obtained shotgun if the individual reasonably believes the drone is flying not more than 200 feet above the individual's property. This is subject to applicable state law on the discharge of a firearm.\n\nNot later than 60 days after an event in which an individual shoots a drone and is able to identify its registration number, the individual must report the event's location and the registration number to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nAn individual may, but shall not be required to, return the drone to the owner at the owner's request.\n\nThe FAA must issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out this bill."
