  <summary date="2025-06-23T16:11:36Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides statutory authority for certain requirements related to registration statements submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

First, the bill allows under statute an emerging growth company to submit profit and loss statements from the previous two years, rather than the previous three years as is required of other reporting companies. In addition, the bill allows under statute any issuer of securities to submit a draft registration statement to the SEC for confidential review prior to a public filing.</summary>
