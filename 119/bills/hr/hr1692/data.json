(OTs, in contrast to traditional procurement contracts, are exempt from many federal procurement laws and regulations.) DHS must notify Congress within 72 hours of using or extending this authority\u00a0for research and development projects related to artificial intelligence technology and must offer to brief Congress on the rationale for such a decision.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also lowers from $4 million to $1 million the minimum value of contract awards that DHS must publicly report on its website."
