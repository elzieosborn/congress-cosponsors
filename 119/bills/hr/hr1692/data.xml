  <summary date="2025-03-12T16:50:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Producing Advanced Technologies for Homeland Security Act or the PATHS Act

This bill extends through FY2028 the authority of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to use other transactions (OT) to carry out research and prototype projects when the use of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements is not feasible or appropriate. (OTs, in contrast to traditional procurement contracts, are exempt from many federal procurement laws and regulations.) DHS must notify Congress within 72 hours of using or extending this authority&#160;for research and development projects related to artificial intelligence technology and must offer to brief Congress on the rationale for such a decision.&#160;

The bill also lowers from $4 million to $1 million the minimum value of contract awards that DHS must publicly report on its website.</summary>
