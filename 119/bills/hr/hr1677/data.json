The President may not waive this prohibition.\n\nThe prohibition shall continue to apply until one year after the\u00a0President certifies to Congress that the Russian government has ended all hostilities against Ukraine. If the Russian government resumes hostilities against Ukraine within three years of a certification, then\u00a0the prohibition shall resume effect."
