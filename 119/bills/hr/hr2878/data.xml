This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) to provide additional information and assistance related to mental health care to veterans in the Solid Start program and members of the Armed Forces in the Transition Assistance Program.

Specifically, the bill requires that counseling provided under DOD&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Transition Assistance Program include additional mental health information, including information about the risk of suicide and other potential&#160;stressors associated with separation from the Armed Forces.

The bill also expands the activities that must be carried out by the VA under the Solid Start program, which is an outreach program for veterans in their first year of separation from service. Specifically, under the program, the VA must (1) assist eligible veterans who elect to enroll in the VA health care system, and (2) educate veterans about mental health and counseling services available through the Veterans Health Administration.</summary>
