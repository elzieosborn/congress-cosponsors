  <summary date="2025-06-05T22:18:57Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico&#160;(USIBWC) to accept funds to study, design, construct, operate, or maintain wastewater treatment works, water conservation projects, or flood control works, and related structures. The USIBWC is a federal government agency and the U.S. component of the International Boundary and Water Commission, which applies the boundary and water treaties of the United States and Mexico and settles differences that may arise in their application.

The USIBWC may not provide credit towards the nonfederal share of project costs, or reimbursement, to nonfederal entities in an amount that exceeds $5 million in any fiscal year.

Further, the&#160;USIBWC may not accept funds from any nonfederal entity that (1) is domiciled in, headquartered in, or organized under the laws of a foreign country of concern (e.g., China, North Korea, Russia, or Iran); or (2) has in place any agreement with a foreign country of concern.

Any funds accepted by the USIBWC must be deposited into the account titled International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico.</summary>
