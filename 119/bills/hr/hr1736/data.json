Generative AI is defined as the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input data to generate derived synthetic content, including images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content.\n\nThe bill also (1) requires\u00a0DHS to review and disseminate related information gathered\u00a0by state and major urban area fusion centers and the National Network of Fusion Centers, and (2) requires other federal agencies to share related information with\u00a0DHS. (A fusion center is a collaborative effort of two or more federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies that combines resources, expertise, or information with the goal of maximizing the ability of such agencies to detect, prevent, investigate, apprehend, and respond to criminal or terrorist activity.)"
