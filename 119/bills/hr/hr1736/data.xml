  <summary date="2025-11-14T14:37:17Z" status="Reported to House">Generative AI Terrorism Risk Assessment Act

This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to periodically provide Congress with an assessment of threats to the United States posed by the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for terrorism. Generative AI is defined as the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input data to generate derived synthetic content, including images, videos, audio, text, and other digital content.

The bill also (1) requires&#160;DHS to review and disseminate related information gathered&#160;by state and major urban area fusion centers and the National Network of Fusion Centers, and (2) requires other federal agencies to share related information with&#160;DHS. (A fusion center is a collaborative effort of two or more federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies that combines resources, expertise, or information with the goal of maximizing the ability of such agencies to detect, prevent, investigate, apprehend, and respond to criminal or terrorist activity.)</summary>
