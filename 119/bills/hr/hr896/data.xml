This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to state educational agencies and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for implementing, administering, and evaluating tutoring programs in elementary and secondary schools.

Additionally, the bill directs ED to establish an advisory board. Among its duties, the advisory board must (1) evaluate and approve plans to ensure that LEAs will meet tutoring program requirements, (2) provide technical assistance and guidance to grant recipients, and (3) develop a nationwide tutoring workforce.</summary>
