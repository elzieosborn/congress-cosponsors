This bill implements a proposed rule by the Small Business Administration (SBA) that allows certain faith-based organizations to access business loan and disaster assistance programs.&#160;

The programs include the Intermediary Lending Program (ILP), Business Loan programs (7(a), microloan,&#160;and 504 programs), Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program, and Immediate Disaster Assistance Program (IDAP).&#160;

Current SBA regulations generally prohibit access to these programs if an organization is&#160;principally engaged in teaching, instructing, counseling, or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs.

Recent Supreme Court opinions have found it unconstitutional to deny an otherwise qualified recipient access to a public benefit based solely on the organization's religious character (e.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of&#160;Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449 (2017)).</summary>
