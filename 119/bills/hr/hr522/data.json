    "text": "Fair Assistance and Impartial Treatment of Help In Small Business Act\n\nThis bill implements a proposed rule by the Small Business Administration (SBA) that allows certain faith-based organizations to access business loan and disaster assistance programs.\u00a0\n\nThe programs include the Intermediary Lending Program (ILP), Business Loan programs (7(a), microloan,\u00a0and 504 programs), Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program, and Immediate Disaster Assistance Program (IDAP).\u00a0\n\nCurrent SBA regulations generally prohibit access to these programs if an organization is\u00a0principally engaged in teaching, instructing, counseling, or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs.\n\nRecent Supreme Court opinions have found it unconstitutional to deny an otherwise qualified recipient access to a public benefit based solely on the organization's religious character (e.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of\u00a0Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449 (2017))."
