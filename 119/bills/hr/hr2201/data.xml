  <summary date="2025-05-15T13:48:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving VA Training for Military Sexual Trauma Claims Act

This bill expands training requirements and assistance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in relation to claims for covered mental health conditions (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) based on military sexual trauma.

Specifically, the bill requires VA employees who process claims for covered mental health conditions based on military sexual trauma to receive annual sensitivity training. Such training must be updated by the VA at least once a year.

The VA must annually report on (1) the training it provides, and (2) any plans to expand and update such training.

In providing assistance with such claims related to military sexual trauma, the VA must obtain the service medical record of the claimant and, if there is not credible supporting evidence of a military sexual trauma in the record, obtain the service personnel record of the claimant.

Additionally, the VA must report to Congress regarding (1) sensitivity training required for health care professionals (including schedulers) who are contracted under a VA pilot program to perform examinations of veterans who make claims related to military sexual trauma, and (2) the VA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s plan to improve such training and ensure veterans are not&#160;retraumatized during such an examination.</summary>
