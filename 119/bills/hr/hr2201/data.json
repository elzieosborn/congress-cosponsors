Such training must be updated by the VA at least once a year.\n\nThe VA must annually report on (1) the training it provides, and (2) any plans to expand and update such training.\n\nIn providing assistance with such claims related to military sexual trauma, the VA must obtain the service medical record of the claimant and, if there is not credible supporting evidence of a military sexual trauma in the record, obtain the service personnel record of the claimant.\n\nAdditionally, the VA must report to Congress regarding (1) sensitivity training required for health care professionals (including schedulers) who are contracted under a VA pilot program to perform examinations of veterans who make claims related to military sexual trauma, and (2) the VA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to improve such training and ensure veterans are not\u00a0retraumatized during such an examination."
