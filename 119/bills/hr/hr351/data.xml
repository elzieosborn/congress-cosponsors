  <summary date="2025-02-18T19:52:53Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)&#160;from establishing or maintaining a value pricing program under the FHWA's&#160;Value Pricing Pilot Program that includes value pricing, congestion pricing, or cordon pricing.&#160;&#160;

In general, value pricing, also referred to as congestion pricing, includes a variety of strategies to manage congestion on highways and surface streets (e.g., charging drivers on congested roadways&#160;during peak periods). Cordon pricing&#160;is a form of congestion pricing that includes&#160;a zone-based pricing system that involves either variable or fixed charges to drive within or into a congested area within a city.</summary>
