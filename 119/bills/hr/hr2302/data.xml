  <summary date="2025-08-01T15:22:57Z" status="Introduced in House">Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians Land Transfer Act of 2025

This bill takes approximately 204.14 acres&#160;of specified lands in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians.

The bill revokes a specified public land order and administratively transfers the land from the Forest Service to the Department of the Interior. (In the public land order, the land was designated for use by the Forest Service as an experiment station.)

The bill directs Interior to take the following lands into trust for the benefit of the tribe: (1) approximately 85.3 acres of federal land managed by Interior's Bureau of Land Management (which includes the land transferred&#160;from the Forest Service), and (2) approximately 118.84 acres of fee land held by the tribe. These combined lands, approximately 204.14 acres, shall be part of the tribe's reservation. Further, the bill prohibits gaming on the land taken into trust.</summary>
