This bill requires federal agencies to conduct an annual survey of managers and make the results publicly available.

The survey must include the topics covered by the existing annual employee survey and also specified questions related to employee performance and the disciplinary system. The bill directs the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe standard survey questions to be included in all agencies' surveys. The bill requires agencies to post their&#160;survey results on agencies' websites unless the agency head determines that doing so would harm national security.&#160;</summary>
