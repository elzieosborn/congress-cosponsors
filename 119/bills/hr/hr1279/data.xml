  <summary date="2025-06-13T20:38:03Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes community engagement requirements (i.e., work requirements) for certain adults under Medicaid.

Specifically, the bill requires individuals ages 18 through 65 to work, engage in community service, or participate in a work program (or a combination of these) for at least 80 hours per month. The bill prohibits federal payments for, and allows state Medicaid programs to disenroll, individuals who do not meet these requirements for three or more months in a year.

The requirements do not apply to individuals who are (1) physically or mentally unfit to work, (2) pregnant, (3) parents or caretakers of children or incapacitated individuals, (4) complying with work requirements for other federal programs, (5) participating in a drug or alcohol treatment and rehabilitation program, or (6) enrolled at least half-time in school.</summary>
