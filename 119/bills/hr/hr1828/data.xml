This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to issue rules requiring school buses to have certain safety features.&#160;DOT must also establish a grant program to assist in the implementation of the requirements.

Specifically, DOT must issue rules requiring school buses to include

three-point safety belts for all seats,a fire suppression system which addresses engine fires,a firewall between the engine and passenger compartment&#160;that prevents hazardous quantities of gas or flames from passing through the firewall,increased&#160;performance standards for interior flammability and smoke emissions,an automatic emergency braking system,an event data recorder, andan electronic stability control system.DOT must also require at least eight hours of behind-the-wheel training for school bus operators that meets specified requirements.

Further, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must issue rules on&#160;the evaluation of safety sensitive personnel for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.

NHTSA&#160;must also study the benefits of requiring school buses manufactured in, or imported into, the United States to be equipped with a motion-activated detection system that is capable of&#160;detecting road users (e.g., pedestrians and bicyclists) and alerting the bus operator of their presence.&#160;NHTSA must issue rules implementing such a requirement.

Finally, DOT must establish a grant program to assist local educational agencies in (1) purchasing school buses equipped with three-point safety belts or any of the other safety features required under this bill, and (2) modifying&#160;existing school buses.</summary>
