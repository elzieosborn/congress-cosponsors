    "text": "Yosemite National Park Equal Access and Fairness Act\n\nThis bill modifies the Raker Act, which allowed San Francisco to dam\u00a0the Hetch Hetchy\u00a0Valley within Yosemite National Park, to (1) increase the annual\u00a0rent San Francisco pays to the National Park Service (NPS), and (2) direct the\u00a0NPS to expand public access to the reservoir and lake created by the dam.\n\nSpecifically, the bill increases rent paid by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission for the use of the park from $30,000 to $2 million per year. That amount must be adjusted annually to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The commission may not recoup such sums from wholesale water or power customers. The bill allows collected rent to be used by the Department of the Interior for wildfire mitigation activities in the park and other national parks in California.\n\nThe bill also requires the NPS\u00a0to administer the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and Lake Eleanor Basin areas for public recreation, benefit, and use in a manner that will preserve scenic, historic, scientific, or otherwise important features."
