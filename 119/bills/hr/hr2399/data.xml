This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a process to vet applicants for certain funding programs that support affordable broadband deployment in high-cost areas, including rural communities.

Specifically, the FCC must conduct a rulemaking to develop a vetting process for applicants seeking funding under high-cost universal service programs for the deployment of a broadband-capable network and the provision of supported services over the network. The FCC must require applications for such funding to document each applicant&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s technical, financial, and operational capabilities related to the proposed deployment, as well as a reasonable business plan.&#160;

The FCC must evaluate applications against reasonable and well-established standards and must consider each applicant&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s history of compliance with the requirements of other government broadband funding programs. After the rulemaking is finalized, funds may only be awarded to applicants that satisfy the standards established therein.&#160;

Finally, the FCC must set financial penalties for applicants that default in some manner during the evaluation process before they are authorized to begin receiving support. &#160;</summary>
