  <summary date="2025-02-06T13:33:36Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits the state of California from receiving federal funds for a high-speed rail corridor development project.&#160;Specifically, the prohibition applies to a project&#160;in California that is the same or substantially similar to the project that is the subject of an FY2010 cooperative agreement entered into on November 18, 2011, between the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).

As background,&#160;CHSRA has received various federal grants for&#160;the California High-Speed Rail&#160;program,&#160;a project led by the state of California with the goal of implementing a high-speed rail&#160;system capable of speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The FRA terminated the specific FY2010&#160;cooperative agreement on May 16, 2019.</summary>
