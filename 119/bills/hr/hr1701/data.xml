  <summary date="2025-05-02T21:31:42Z" status="Introduced in House">Strategic Ports Reporting Act

This bill requires the Department of State to conduct a study&#160;and submit a report to Congress on strategic ports.

The report shall contain various&#160;elements related to such ports, including (1) a detailed list of all strategic ports owned, operated, or controlled by China or a foreign person of China; (2) a detailed list of all strategic ports owned, operated, or controlled by the United States or a U.S. person; (3) an assessment of the national security and economic interests relevant to each such port; (4) an analysis of actions by China to gain control or ownership of strategic ports; and (5) courses of action to protect strategic ports and maritime infrastructure from Chinese control.

The bill also requires the State Department to develop and provide to Congress a global mapping of foreign and domestic ports of importance to the United States because of a capability to provide military, diplomatic, economic, or resource exploitation superiority.</summary>
