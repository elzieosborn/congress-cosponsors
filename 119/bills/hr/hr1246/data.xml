This bill allows Farm Credit System (FCS) institutions to make and participate in loans and commitments (and extend other technical and financial assistance) for essential community facility&#160;projects as part of the Department of Agriculture's&#160;Community Facilities Direct Loan &amp; Grant Program. This program provides funding to develop essential community facilities in rural areas.

The&#160;FCS financing and technical assistance&#160;may be provided in order to make capital available to develop, build, maintain, improve, or provide related equipment or&#160;other support for essential community facilities in rural communities (e.g., certain facilities that provide healthcare, community support, public safety, educational, or utility services).

Under the bill, the&#160;financing provided by an FCS institution may not&#160;exceed 15% of the total of all outstanding loans of the institution.&#160;Further, an FCS institution must (1) offer at least one non-FCS lending institution an interest in the financing under reasonable terms and conditions acceptable to the borrower, and (2) report the offer to the&#160;Farm Credit Administration (FCA).

The FCA must submit an annual report to Congress on the activities undertaken by FCS institutions under this bill, including through the partnerships between FCS institutions and other lending institutions. The FCA must post the report on the administration's website.</summary>
