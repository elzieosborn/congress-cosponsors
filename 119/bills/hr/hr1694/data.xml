  <summary date="2025-05-14T19:00:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Artificial Intelligence Accountability Act or the AI Accountability Act

This bill requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to study and report on accountability measures for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Under the bill, accountability measures are mechanisms designed to assure that a system is trustworthy, including audits, assessments, and certifications.&#160;

Specifically, the NTIA must study, solicit stakeholder feedback about, and report to Congress on the incorporation of accountability measures into AI systems used by communications technologies (such as telecommunications networks and social media platforms) and the ways in which AI accountability measures reduce risks related to AI systems (e.g., cybersecurity risks), among other topics.&#160;

The NTIA must also solicit stakeholder feedback and report to Congress on (1) information that should be available to individuals, communities, and businesses that interact with, are affected by, or study AI systems; and (2) methods for making that information available.</summary>
