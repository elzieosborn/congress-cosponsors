    "text": "Quality Loss Adjustment Improvement for Farmers Act\n\nThis bill directs the\u00a0Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to review and revise quality loss adjustment coverage\u00a0and provides for the establishment of a regional discount factor for soybeans, as needed.\n\nThe FCIC is a government corporation that\u00a0finances and administers the federal crop insurance program (FCIP) operations. Under the FCIP, farmers may\u00a0purchase insurance coverage against financial losses\u00a0caused by certain adverse growing and market conditions,\u00a0including for quality losses. The federal government subsidizes the premiums that farmers pay for these insurance policies.\u00a0\n\nThe bill directs the FCIC to contract with a qualified entity to conduct a review at least once every five years\u00a0of the quality loss adjustment procedures. Based on each review, the FCIC must make adjustments to the procedures. Each review must include engagement from regionally diverse industry stakeholders for each agricultural commodity for which a quality loss adjustment is offered.\n\nThe bill also directs the\u00a0FCIC, in certain circumstances, to establish a\u00a0state or regional discount factor for soybeans to reflect the average quality discounts applied to the local or regional market prices of the soybean crop. The FCIC must take this action\u00a0in the event of (1) specific emergency or disaster declarations for a state or region, or (2) the occurrence of a salvage market for soybeans in a state or region."
