This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to issue rules for disclosing information about federal contract solicitations for which small businesses were eligible and that were issued and cancelled.

Under the rules for&#160;such a solicitation, an agency must provide&#160;(1) a justification for the cancellation,&#160;(2) information about any plans to reissue the solicitation and any associated&#160;time frames,&#160;and (3) information about any plans to include the requirements of the solicitation in another contract or task order of the agency.

Additionally, for such solicitations that an agency does not intend to reissue, the SBA must provide procedures for the agency to refer a small business that prepared a bid for such covered solicitation to the&#160;Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization for assistance in identifying similar contracting opportunities.</summary>
