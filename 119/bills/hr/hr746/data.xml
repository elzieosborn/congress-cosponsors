This bill limits the eligibility of certain&#160;non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) for various federal benefits and grants, makes permanent the child tax credit increase, and requires individuals to provide evidence of satisfactory immigration status prior to receiving specified benefits.

The bill prohibits&#160;asylees, parolees, and individuals withheld from removal from receiving certain federal benefits, including Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), and Supplemental Security Income. The bill further restricts on the basis of immigration status benefits under federal health programs such as Medicare, emergency disaster relief, housing assistance, food assistance, early childhood assistance, student aid, and Community Development Block Grants.

The bill also makes permanent the increase in the child tax credit set to expire at the end of 2025. In addition, this tax credit and the earned income tax credit are not available to&#160;asylees, parolees, individuals granted temporary protected status, individuals withheld from removal, individuals granted&#160;deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) status, and&#160;non-U.S. nationals with employment-based immigrant visas.

Federal aid is reduced for&#160;elementary and secondary education by 50% annually to jurisdictions that do not assist federal immigration enforcement actions (deemed sanctuary jurisdictions under the bill).

The bill also removes statutory exemptions for Haitian entrants that allows such entrants to receive various aid.

Certain benefits are prohibited, including Medicaid and SNAP, until an applicant&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s satisfactory immigration status is proved.

The bill prohibits tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charitable organizations from using federal funds to support certain non-U.S. nationals.</summary>
