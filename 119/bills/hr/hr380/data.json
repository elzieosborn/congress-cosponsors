Under the bill, a noncontiguous area includes Alaska and Hawaii and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States (including Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands).\n\nAdditionally, such shipping services may not exclude services to such a noncontiguous location.\n\nConsumer products or producer goods valued at more than $10,000 are exempt from the requirements of this bill."
