This bill limits shipping services from excluding service or charging higher prices to noncontiguous areas of the United States.

Specifically, private shipping services (e.g., FedEx) and the U.S. Postal Service are prohibited from charging a higher rate to ship a consumer&#160;product or producer good (e.g., raw material)&#160;to a noncontiguous area of the United States than they charge to ship the same product&#160;to and from a location within the contiguous United States. Under the bill, a noncontiguous area includes Alaska and Hawaii and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States (including Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands).

Additionally, such shipping services may not exclude services to such a noncontiguous location.

Consumer products or producer goods valued at more than $10,000 are exempt from the requirements of this bill.</summary>
