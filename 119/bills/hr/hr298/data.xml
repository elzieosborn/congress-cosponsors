  <summary date="2025-07-07T16:06:42Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill eliminates certain statutory restrictions on U.S. security assistance to Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey.&#160;

For example, the bill eliminates requirements that the President

as a condition of transferring defense articles to Cyprus, annually certify to Congress that Cyprus is taking certain actions with regards to money laundering, financial regulatory oversight, and denying refueling and servicing to Russian military vessels; andwhen requesting certain security assistance funds from Congress for Greece and Turkey, certify that providing such assistance is compatible with specified principles that support U.S. policy in the region (e.g., that such security assistance is intended solely for defensive purposes and preserves the balance of military strength among countries of the region).</summary>
