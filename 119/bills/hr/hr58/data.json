(An aggravated felony conviction carries various immigration consequences, such as rendering the non-U.S. national inadmissible, deportable, and barred from establishing good moral character for naturalization.)\n\nA non-U.S. national who is unlawfully present and who knowingly violates the prohibition against voting in a federal election shall be deportable."
