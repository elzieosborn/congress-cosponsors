    "text": "Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act\n\nThis bill establishes a new process for approving or revoking permits for the construction and operation of energy infrastructure across an international border of the United States. Thus, it replaces the existing process established under specified executive orders.\n\nThe bill requires a person to obtain a certificate of crossing before constructing, connecting, operating, or maintaining a border-crossing facility for the import or export of oil or natural gas,\u00a0or the transmission of electricity, across a U.S. border with Canada or Mexico. A certificate must be obtained from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a facility consisting of oil or natural gas pipelines or the Department of Energy (DOE) for an electric transmission facility. As a condition of issuing a certificate, DOE must require that an electric transmission facility be constructed, connected, operated, or maintained consistent with specified policies and standards.\n\nFERC and DOE must meet a deadline for issuing a certificate as set forth by this bill. The bill also requires FERC to meet a deadline for approving applications to import or export natural gas to or from Canada or Mexico.\n\nThe bill also requires the President to obtain the approval of Congress before revoking a permit issued under executive orders for constructing, connecting, operating, or maintaining an oil or natural gas pipeline, an electric transmission facility, or a related border-crossing facility."
