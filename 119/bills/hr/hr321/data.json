The\u00a0TSA PreCheck\u00a0program expedites traveler screening through participating TSA security checkpoints.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the FAA and the TSA must collaborate to establish a system to expedite gate passes and flight access procedures for these individuals. The system must ensure that these caregivers, parents, and guardians are provided up to two gate passes."
