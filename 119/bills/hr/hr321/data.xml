This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to allow caregivers, parents, and guardians who already qualify for the TSA PreCheck program to accompany minors and passengers needing assistance to their flights. The&#160;TSA PreCheck&#160;program expedites traveler screening through participating TSA security checkpoints.&#160;

Specifically, the FAA and the TSA must collaborate to establish a system to expedite gate passes and flight access procedures for these individuals. The system must ensure that these caregivers, parents, and guardians are provided up to two gate passes.</summary>
