Additionally, the bill prohibits the use of federal funds to establish similar positions to that of Chief Diversity Officer or Senior Advisor for Diversity and Inclusion within DOD.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled\u00a0Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, which\u00a0directed the termination of all federal diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs, offices, and positions, including Chief Diversity Officer positions. On January 27, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order titled\u00a0Restoring America's Fighting Force, which specifically directed the abolishment of every diversity, equity and inclusion office within DOD and the Department of Homeland Security with regard to the Coast Guard."
