This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to report to Congress on the feasibility, potential benefits, and risks associated with implementing distributed ledger technology to improve claims adjudication and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse within the VA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s benefits administration systems. Under the bill, a distributed ledger (1) is shared across a set of distributed nodes that participate in a network and store a complete or partial replica of the ledger, (2) is synchronized between the nodes, and (3) has data appended to it by following a specified consensus mechanism.</summary>
