This bill directs the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the Department of Agriculture to carry out a study and make recommendations regarding conservation practices on leased agricultural land.

The study must (1) address issues such as participation in conservation programs and barriers to adopting conservation practices; and (2) be carried out with particular consideration of farmers and ranchers who are people of color, including Black and indigenous farmers and ranchers, and beginning farmers and ranchers.

NASS may enter into an agreement with a nonfederal entity (e.g., a nonprofit entity or university) to carry out the study.</summary>
