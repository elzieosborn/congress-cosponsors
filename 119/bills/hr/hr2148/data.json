The VA must also provide retirement planning services to primary family caregivers and study the feasibility and advisability of establishing a retirement plan or retirement savings for caregivers.\n\nFurther, unless they were discharged for fraud, abuse, or mistreatment, the VA must provide to primary family caregivers (1) assistance returning to the workforce upon discharge or dismissal from the program, (2) support in transitioning from\u00a0caregiving, and (3) specified employment assistance during their tenure as a caregiver and for the following 180-days.\n\nThe VA must partner with the\u00a0Department of Labor to study and report on the feasibility and advisability of conducting a program to assist primary caregivers in returning to the workforce.\n\nFinally, the Government Accountability Office must report on the VA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts supporting family caregivers in transitioning from caregiving."
