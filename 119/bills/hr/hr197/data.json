The land acquired by the Forest Service must be added to and managed as part of Chippewa National Forest.\u00a0\n\nThe bill outlines requirements and conditions for the exchange. For example, the Forest Service must reserve an easement for road access to certain land in the forest. The bill also conditions the exchange on the satisfactory completion of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment by BWLT\u00a0before the nonfederal land is accepted in the exchange.\n\nIn addition, the exchange must\u00a0be for equal value or the values must be equalized by a cash payment, subject to an exception.\n\nFinally, the bill directs\u00a0BWLT to pay all closing costs associated with the exchange."
