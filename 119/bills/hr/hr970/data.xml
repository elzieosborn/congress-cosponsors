This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to periodically review and report on the maximum coverage available under the&#160;Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance and Veterans' Group Life Insurance programs. Specifically, the VA must review such coverage amount every five years, taking into account the average percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased in the five fiscal years preceding the review.</summary>
