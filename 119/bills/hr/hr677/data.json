(The mission of the board is to provide an impartial forum within Interior for the resolution of disputes involving public lands and natural resources under Interior's jurisdiction.)\n\nIf a party submits such a\u00a0request, the board must issue a final decision on the appeal not later than six months after the date on which the request for expedited review was received. However, the deadline may not be earlier than 18 months after the date on which the appeal was initially filed with the board.\n\nIf the deadline for expedited review is not met, Interior's decision is deemed a final agency action and\u00a0is subject to de novo judicial review (i.e., without deference to the agency's decision).\n\nThis bill applies to appeals pending as of the date of enactment of this bill and appeals filed after the date of enactment."
