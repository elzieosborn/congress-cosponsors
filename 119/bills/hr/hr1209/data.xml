This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to report to Congress on the status of proposals to establish a timeline and process (1) to end the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and (2) for Treasury to resolve its investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (As a result of the financial crisis, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered into a conservatorship in 2008 with the Federal Housing Finance Agency. As part of this agreement, Treasury provided funds to support the solvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.)&#160; &#160;</summary>
