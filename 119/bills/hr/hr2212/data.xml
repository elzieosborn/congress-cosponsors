This bill requires all components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Intelligence Enterprise to participate in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Intelligence Community (IC) Civilian Joint Duty Program.&#160;

The DHS Intelligence Enterprise is the primary mechanism to integrate DHS's intelligence programs. It is composed of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the intelligence components of nine other DHS organizations, such as the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The IC Civilian Joint Duty Program offers federal civilian intelligence professionals the opportunity to broaden their experience by serving at a&#160;different IC element or relevant organization, or in certain positions within the individual's own IC element,&#160;for up to three years.</summary>
