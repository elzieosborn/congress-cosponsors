This bill establishes the Life Sciences Research Security Board to oversee the award of federal funding for high-risk life sciences research.&#160;High-risk life sciences research means&#160;the study of an organism,&#160;virus, or related product that could be misapplied to pose a significant threat to the public or could enhance the transmissibility or&#160;virulence of certain high-risk&#160;pathogens (e.g., Ebola).

Specifically, the bill establishes the board as an independent agency that must review proposed high-risk life sciences research, determine whether a federal agency may award funding for the research, and determine minimum required controls for funded research. Entities that are seeking federal funding must attest to whether their research is high-risk life sciences research. Agencies must certify the validity of these attestations and submit proposed high-risk life sciences research to the board. Agencies must also notify the board of intended awards for other life sciences research for potential review.

In making&#160;its determinations, the board must consider specified&#160;factors,&#160;including whether the benefits of the research outweigh the&#160;risks. The bill prohibits agencies from awarding federal funding for high-risk life sciences research without approval of the board or for life sciences research currently under board review. The board may also&#160;review awards that were made&#160;before the bill&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s enactment.

Entities that fail to properly&#160;attest to the nature of their research may lose their eligibility for funding. Additionally, agency employees who fail to comply with the bill's requirements are subject to disciplinary action.</summary>
