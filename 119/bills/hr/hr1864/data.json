    "text": "Risky Research Review Act\n\nThis bill establishes the Life Sciences Research Security Board to oversee the award of federal funding for high-risk life sciences research.\u00a0High-risk life sciences research means\u00a0the study of an organism,\u00a0virus, or related product that could be misapplied to pose a significant threat to the public or could enhance the transmissibility or\u00a0virulence of certain high-risk\u00a0pathogens (e.g., Ebola).\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes the board as an independent agency that must review proposed high-risk life sciences research, determine whether a federal agency may award funding for the research, and determine minimum required controls for funded research. Entities that are seeking federal funding must attest to whether their research is high-risk life sciences research. Agencies must certify the validity of these attestations and submit proposed high-risk life sciences research to the board. Agencies must also notify the board of intended awards for other life sciences research for potential review.\n\nIn making\u00a0its determinations, the board must consider specified\u00a0factors,\u00a0including whether the benefits of the research outweigh the\u00a0risks. The bill prohibits agencies from awarding federal funding for high-risk life sciences research without approval of the board or for life sciences research currently under board review. The board may also\u00a0review awards that were made\u00a0before the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enactment.\n\nEntities that fail to properly\u00a0attest to the nature of their research may lose their eligibility for funding. Additionally, agency employees who fail to comply with the bill's requirements are subject to disciplinary action."
