This bill rescinds certain changes that were made in 2023 to&#160;District of Columbia (DC) law governing discipline of Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officers.

First, the bill reinstates a 90-day statute of limitations (i.e., time limit) for initiating a corrective or adverse action against any MPD officer or civilian&#160;employee. The bill also allows officer disciplinary&#160;matters to be negotiated as part of a collective bargaining agreement.&#160;

Next, the bill eliminates the MPD police chief's&#160;authority to increase the police trial board's recommended&#160;penalty for officer misconduct.

Finally, the bill eliminates a requirement that MPD publish a schedule online of&#160;disciplinary&#160;hearings for which the proposed action is termination, including the date, time, and underlying allegations.&#160;</summary>
