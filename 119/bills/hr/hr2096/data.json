The bill also allows officer disciplinary\u00a0matters to be negotiated as part of a collective bargaining agreement.\u00a0\n\nNext, the bill eliminates the MPD police chief's\u00a0authority to increase the police trial board's recommended\u00a0penalty for officer misconduct.\n\nFinally, the bill eliminates a requirement that MPD publish a schedule online of\u00a0disciplinary\u00a0hearings for which the proposed action is termination, including the date, time, and underlying allegations.\u00a0"
