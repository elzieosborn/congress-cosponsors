This bill establishes a series of programs and requirements relating to Medicaid coverage of individuals affected by a federally declared major disaster, national emergency, or public health emergency.

In particular, the bill provides for specific coverage under Medicaid for individuals who meet specified income eligibility standards and were either residents of the impacted area or were employed in the impacted area (and subsequently lost employment). Coverage is effective for two years after the date of the disaster or emergency declaration.

State Medicaid programs must provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the state's Medicaid coverage and the Medicaid coverage of the individual's home state, as applicable. The bill applies a 100% Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) to such coverage and related administrative expenses.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must contract with a nonprofit to evaluate the impact of the bill's implementation.</summary>
