This bill prohibits federal officeholders from directly soliciting contributions for certain federal election purposes.&#160;

Specifically, the bill prohibits a federal officeholder from soliciting funds directly from any person (1) for or on behalf of any political committee, or (2) for or on the behalf of any person for use for federal election activity. However, a federal officeholder may participate in a fundraising event (e.g., planning, attending, or speaking at an event), as long as the federal officeholder does not engage in any written or verbal solicitation of funds in connection with the event.</summary>
