    "text": "Ensuring Distance Education Act\n\nThis bill treats revenue from distance education programs as nonfederal revenue for purposes of the 90/10 rule.\n\nGenerally, the 90/10 rule requires a for-profit institution of higher education (IHE) to derive at least 10% of its revenue from sources other than federal financial aid. Under current Department of Education regulations, for-profit IHEs are prohibited from including revenue from distance education programs (including hybrid distance education programs) as nonfederal revenue that meets this 10% requirement. The bill removes the prohibition and allows for distance education programs to be counted as nonfederal revenue for purposes of the rule."
