This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide employees at any federal agency that has not met the goal of awarding at least 3% of its prime contracts and subcontracts to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans with training to increase the number of such contracts awarded.

For each fiscal year, the SBA must report a list of each agency that did not meet the contracting goal and the number of trainings the SBA provided.</summary>
