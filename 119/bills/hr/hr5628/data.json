For subsequent lapses in appropriations, the bill requires that each employee be reimbursed for any shutdown costs on the earliest date possible after the end of a lapse in appropriations that lasts at least 14 days.\n\nStates must be reimbursed for payments for assistance programs that would otherwise be provided by the federal government but\u00a0for a lapse in appropriations that lasts at least 14 days. The states must be reimbursed no later than 90 days after the end of the lapse in appropriations.\u00a0\n\nThe reimbursements required by this bill are subject to the availability of appropriations.\u00a0"
