This bill requires the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCA) to revise regulations to relax certain requirements related to commercial driver's license (CDL) testing.

Specifically, the FMCA must allow a state or third-party examiner who has maintained a valid CDL test examiner certification and has previously completed a CDL skills test examiner training course to administer the CDL knowledge test, so long as they have completed one unit of instruction regarding&#160;the CDL knowledge test.

The FMCA must also allow a state to administer a driving skills test to any CDL applicant regardless of the applicant's state of domicile or where the applicant received driver training.

As background, the FMCA implemented temporary waivers for similar CDL testing-related requirements&#160;in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These waivers have since expired.</summary>
