This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive grants to eligible institutions of higher education (IHEs) to carry out skills-for-success courses for all enrolled first-year students (including transfer students).&#160;Skills-for-success course means a course that (1) has a low student-to-teacher ratio, (2) is not graded or is pass-fail, and (3) provides skills for success in college in specified topics (e.g., time management skills, coping with stress, and goal setting).&#160;

In awarding grants, ED must give priority to IHEs where at least 50% of all students enrolled in the most recent academic year were eligible to receive a Federal&#160;Pell Grant.</summary>
