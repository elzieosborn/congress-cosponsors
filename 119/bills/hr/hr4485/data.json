The USDA-appointed advisory panel must include representatives who are scientists (including experts on climate science and nutrition science) and representatives from environmental advocacy organizations, industry, and federal agencies.\n\nThe panel's report must include recommendations regarding the development of a climate-friendly certification for agricultural products that (1) moves agricultural producers toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis, and (2) uses market-based approaches that allow for greater consumer choice and education.\n\nUSDA may not issue any related regulations or guidance (or otherwise certify or advertise any agricultural product as climate-friendly) before the report is submitted to Congress."
