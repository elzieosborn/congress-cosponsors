This bill establishes an advisory panel to study and submit a report to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Congress on the development of a climate-friendly certification for agricultural products. The USDA-appointed advisory panel must include representatives who are scientists (including experts on climate science and nutrition science) and representatives from environmental advocacy organizations, industry, and federal agencies.

The panel's report must include recommendations regarding the development of a climate-friendly certification for agricultural products that (1) moves agricultural producers toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis, and (2) uses market-based approaches that allow for greater consumer choice and education.

USDA may not issue any related regulations or guidance (or otherwise certify or advertise any agricultural product as climate-friendly) before the report is submitted to Congress.</summary>
