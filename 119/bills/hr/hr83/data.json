Specifically, the bill (1)\u00a0eliminates the standards, assessments, and academic accountability requirements for state and local educational agencies that receive federal funds for the education of disadvantaged children; (2) requires such funds to be allocated based on the number of children residing in each state who are living in poverty; and (3) allows educational agencies to distribute per-pupil amounts from such funds to parents for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses.\n\nThe bill prohibits federal officers or employees from mandating academic standards, assessments, curricula, or accountability systems."
