  <summary date="2025-03-13T16:11:29Z" status="Introduced in House">Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act

This bill prohibits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from using appropriated funds to procure a battery produced by certain entities, particularly six specific companies owned and operated in China. This prohibition begins on October 1, 2027.

The bill allows DHS to waive the prohibition if DHS assesses in the affirmative that (1)&#160;the batteries to be procured do not pose a risk to U.S. national security, data, or infrastructure; and (2)&#160;there is no available alternative to procure batteries that are of similar or better cost and quality and that are produced by an entity not specified in this bill.

DHS may also waive the prohibition upon a determination that the batteries to be procured are for the sole purpose of research, evaluation, training, testing, or analysis.

The bill requires DHS to notify Congress within 15 days after granting a waiver under this bill.

The bill also requires DHS to report to Congress on the anticipated impacts associated with carrying out this bill, including with respect to specified agencies of DHS.</summary>
