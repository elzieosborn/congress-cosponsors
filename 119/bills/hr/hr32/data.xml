This bill makes a state or political subdivision of a state ineligible for any federal funds that the jurisdiction intends to use to benefit non-U.S. nationals (i.e., aliens under federal law) who are unlawfully present if the jurisdiction withholds information about citizenship or immigration status or does not cooperate with immigration detainers.

Specifically, such funds are denied to any jurisdiction that has a law, policy, or practice that prohibits or restricts any government entity from

maintaining, sending, or receiving information regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any individual;exchanging information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status with a federal, state, or local government entity;&#160;complying with a valid immigration detainer from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); or&#160;notifying DHS about an individual's release from custody.The funding restriction does not apply&#160;to a law, policy, or practice that only applies to an individual who comes forward as a victim of or a witness to a criminal offense.

DHS must annually provide to specified congressional committees a list of jurisdictions that have failed to comply with a DHS detainer or have failed to notify DHS of an individual&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s release.

The funding restriction begins 60 days after the bill's enactment or on the first day of&#160;the fiscal year following&#160;the bill's enactment, whichever is earlier.</summary>
