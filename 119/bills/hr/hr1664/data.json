    "text": "Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2025\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Commerce to support the leadership of the United States in the use of blockchain technology and other distributed ledger technology, tokens, and tokenization. Generally, blockchain technology is a distributed digital ledger that uses cryptography to share verified information across a network of computers. Tokens refer to the transferrable, digital representation of information recorded on blockchain technology and tokenization is the process of creating a token.\n\nSpecifically, Commerce must advise the President on policies related\u00a0to the deployment and use of blockchain technology and other distributed ledger technology, applications built on blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology, tokens, and tokenization. Commerce also must establish advisory committees to support the adoption of blockchain technology to facilitate the development of best practices with respect to blockchain technology, applications built on blockchain technology, tokens, and tokenization.\n\nCommerce must report annually on the activities under this bill and provide any recommendations for additional legislation to strengthen U.S. competitiveness with respect to blockchain technology."
