Specifically, the EPA must publish information, for each of the previous 10 years, on the total emissions of carbon dioxide and methane that are released (1) within the boundaries of the United States that are the result of the extraction, processing, transportation, combustion, and other use of fossil fuels; and (2) outside the boundaries of the United States that are the result of leakage and combustion of fossil fuels produced or refined in the United States and subsequently exported."
