    "text": "This bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. \u00a0\n\nIt is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by several congressional committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House or Senate Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)\n\nTITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY\n\nThis title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).\n\nSubtitle A--Nutrition\n\n(Sec. 10101)\u00a0This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.\n\nAs background, USDA created the TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.\n\n(Sec. 10102)\u00a0This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs).\n\nAs background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements. SNAP law limits benefits to ABAWDs to 3 months out of a 36-month period, unless the participant meets the additional work-related requirements.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.\n\nFirst, the section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.\n\nSecond, the ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to\u00a0a dependent child under the age of 14. Currently, those with a child\u00a0under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirements.\n\nThis section includes an exception for individuals who are Indians, Urban Indians, or California Indians (as these terms are defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act).\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the section eliminates the current exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).\n\nFinally, this section modifies the ABAWD waiver program's allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section allows Alaska and Hawaii to qualify for the state exemption with an unemployment rate that is at or above 1.5 times the national unemployment rate.\u00a0Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.\n\n(Sec. 10103)\u00a0This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.\n\nAs background, when determining a household\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.\n\n(Sec.10104) This section prohibits any service fee associated with an internet connection\u00a0 from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.\n\n(Sec. 10105) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments\u00a0beginning in FY2028. The state contribution ranges from 0% to 15% for the cost of SNAP program allotments and is based on the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SNAP payment error rate. Currently, the state match is 0%.\n\nFor FY2028, a state may elect either the FY2025 or FY2026 payment error rate to calculate its state-matching fund requirement. For FY2029 and each fiscal year thereafter, the state match is calculated using the payment error rate that is three fiscal years prior.\n\nAny state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% will have a state match of 0% (i.e., the state does not have to contribute).\n\nA state with a payment error rate that is\n\nat least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 5%,at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 10%, and10% or greater must contribute 15%.(Sec. 10106) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs\u00a0beginning in FY2027 and for each fiscal year thereafter. Currently, USDA must pay 50%\u00a0of all administrative costs, thus this section increases\u00a0the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.\n\n(Sec. 10107)\u00a0This section eliminates\u00a0funding for\u00a0the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).\n\n(Sec. 10108) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals; (2) aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions; (3) aliens who have been granted the status of Cuban or Haitian entrant; or (4) individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.\n\nCurrently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.\n\nSubtitle B-- Forestry\n\n(Sec. 10201) This section rescinds certain funds provided to the Forest Service as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. For example, this includes the rescission of funds for\u00a0\n\nthe protection of old-growth forests on National Forest System land,grants for nonfederal forest landowners for climate mitigation or forest resilience practices,grants for state and private forestry conservation programs for tree planting, andadministrative costs for the National Forest System to implement these and other related programs.Subtitle C--Commodities\n\nThis subtitle amends and extends commodity support programs.\n\nFor example, the subtitle extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.\n\n(Sec. 10313) This section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which include\n\nchanging the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;setting production history for the\u00a0DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;raising the coverage limit to the first 6 million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first 5 million pounds; andallowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance Programs\n\nThis subtitle expands the types of eligible losses covered under the permanently authorized agricultural disaster assistance programs, which include the Livestock Indemnity Program; the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; the\u00a0Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program; and the\u00a0Tree Assistance Program. This subtitle also increases coverage levels and lowers the threshold for triggering payments for certain eligible losses.\n\nSubtitle\u00a0E--Crop Insurance\n\nThis subtitle increases certain crop insurance premium subsidies and increases additional premium subsidies available for beginning farmers and ranchers. The subtitle also increases coverage levels for Supplemental Coverage Option and Whole Farm Revenue Protection policies, increases support for administrative and operating costs incurred by approved crop insurance providers, and increases funds available for program compliance and integrity.\n\nIn addition, this subtitle\u00a0provides for the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program in order to provide index-based insurance for contract poultry growers.\n\nSubtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America\u00a0\n\n(Sec. 10601) This section reauthorizes or modifies the funding levels for the following programs through FY2031:\n\nAgriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP),Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP),Grassroots Source Water Protection Program,Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, andFeral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program.This section also rescinds the unobligated funds that were provided for the ACEP, EQIP, CSP, and RCPP conservation programs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\n(Sec. 10602)\u00a0This section directs USDA to carry out a program to encourage the accessibility, development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. This section also provides $285 million in mandatory funding for the program for FY2027 and each fiscal year thereafter.\n\n(Sec. 10603)\u00a0This section extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).\n\n(Sec. 10604)\u00a0This section reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.\n\nFor example, this section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This National Institute of Food and Agriculture program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.\n\nThis section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026.

This section also increases to $4 million (from $3.13 million in 2025 and adjusted annually for inflation) the dollar amount at which the tax deduction begins to phase out. Both amounts continue to be annually adjusted for inflation.\n\n(Sec. 70307) This section provides for an elective 100% depreciation allowance for nonresidential real property that is placed into service before January 1, 2031, and that meets certain other requirements.

(Some limitations apply.)\n\n(Sec. 70322) This section excludes from deduction-eligible income for purposes of calculating foreign-derived intangible income (and the tax deduction for such income) income or gain from the sale or other disposition (including the deemed sale or other disposition) occurring after June 16, 2025, of (1) property of a type that gives rise to rents or royalties, and (2) any other property that is subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion by the seller of such property.\n\nFurther, under this section, deduction-eligible income must be reduced by expenses and deductions directly related to such income.\n\n(Sec. 70323) This section eliminates the use of a domestic corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deemed tangible income return in determining foreign-derived intangible income and such corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net deemed tangible income return in determining GILTI.

(This section reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions, the implementation of which was delayed and phased in by the IRS. For 2025, under current law, such organizations are required to issue IRS Form 1099-K to payees who receive more than $2,500, regardless of the number of transactions.)\n\n(Sec. 70434) This section expands the federal tax deduction for certain film, television, and theatrical production costs to allow a deduction of up to $150,000 of qualified sound recording production costs in the tax year such costs are incurred.

The CMS must notify states on at least a monthly basis of individuals who are enrolled in multiple states so that states may take appropriate action.\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 and FY2029 for the CMS to establish and maintain the new system, respectively.\n\n(Sec. 71104) This section requires state Medicaid programs to check, beginning in 2028, the Social Security Administration's Death Master File on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether Medicaid enrollees are deceased.\n\n(Sec. 71105) This section provides statutory authority for the requirement that state Medicaid programs check, as part of the provider enrollment and reenrollment process, whether providers are deceased through the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.\u00a0Beginning in 2028, the section requires states to continue to check this database on at least a quarterly basis after providers are enrolled.\n\n(Sec. 71107) This section requires state Medicaid programs to redetermine every six months, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, the eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (The act allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to all adults under the age of 65 with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, including able-bodied adults without dependent children.)\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.\n\n(Sec. 71109) This section generally restricts, beginning in FY2027, federal payment for Medicaid and CHIP to services for individuals who are U.S. residents and are either U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, or Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States.\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.\n\n(Sec. 71110) This section limits, beginning in FY2027, the Medicaid federal matching rate for emergency services provided to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States to the same matching rate as would otherwise apply for such services (rather than the enhanced federal matching rate for states that have expanded Medicaid).\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.\n\nSubchapter B--Preventing Wasteful Spending\n\n(Sec. 71112) This section specifies that, beginning with the first quarter after December 31, 2026, Medicaid coverage may begin retroactively (1) for individuals in the Medicaid expansion population, one month prior to the application filing date; and (2) for all other individuals, two months prior to the application filing date. Additionally, CHIP coverage may retroactively begin two months prior to the application filing date. (Currently, coverage may begin three months prior to the application filing date.)\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.\n\n(Sec. 71113) This section prohibits federal Medicaid payment for one year to nonprofit health care providers that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved individuals (i.e., essential community providers) if the provider (1) primarily furnishes family planning services, reproductive health, and related care; (2) offers abortions in cases other than that of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions for the woman; and (3) in FY2023, received federal and state Medicaid payments totaling more than $800,000.\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.\n\nSubchapter C--Stopping Abusive Financing Practices\n\n(Sec. 71114) This section requires states that had not chosen to expand Medicaid pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prior to March 11, 2021, to do so by January 1, 2026, in order to receive the corresponding enhanced federal matching rate.\n\n(Sec. 71115) This section generally limits Medicaid provider taxes beginning in FY2027.\n\nUnder current law, states may impose a provider tax of up to 6% of net patient service revenues to potentially receive additional federal matching funds. The section precludes states that have not expanded Medicaid from increasing the rate of a provider tax beyond that currently in effect in order to qualify for federal matching funds. For states that have expanded Medicaid, a provider tax may not exceed the current rate or a specified rate, whichever is lower; the maximum rate gradually decreases from FY2028-FY2032, with a maximum rate of 3.5% beginning in FY2032 (these limits do not apply to nursing and intermediate care facilities, which are instead limited to current rates). The section additionally precludes states from imposing a new provider tax if there is not already one in effect.\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.\n\n(Sec. 71116) This section provides funds through FY2033 for the CMS to revise regulations so as to limit state-directed payments for inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or qualified practitioner services at an academic medical center under Medicaid managed care contracts to the payment rate for services under Medicare, rather than the average commercial rate. For states that cover the Medicaid expansion population, payment is limited to 100% of the Medicare rate; for other states, payment is limited to 110% of the Medicare rate.\n\nSubchapter D--Increasing Personal Accountability\n\n(Sec. 71119) This section requires, beginning not later than the first quarter after December 31, 2026 (or earlier, at the option of the state), individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population to engage in community service, work, or other activities in order to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nSpecifically, the section requires these individuals to, on a monthly basis, (1) work at least 80 hours, (2) complete at least 80 hours of community service, (3) participate in a work program for at least 80 hours, (4) be enrolled at least half-time in an educational program, or (5) engage in any combination thereof for a total of at least 80 hours. Individuals may also qualify if they have a monthly income (or, for seasonal workers, an average monthly income over six months) that is at least as much as the equivalent of minimum wage multiplied by 80 hours.\n\nIndividuals who are applying for Medicaid must demonstrate compliance with these requirements for one to three months (as determined by the state) consecutively and immediately prior to filing an application; individuals who are already enrolled in Medicaid must demonstrate compliance for one month or more (as determined by the state), whether or not consecutive, during the period between the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last eligibility determination and the next scheduled eligibility determination.\u00a0\n\nStates must verify an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compliance upon a determination or redetermination of eligibility but may also choose to verify compliance more frequently. States may not waive the new requirements. However, states may choose to provide an exception for individuals experiencing short-term hardships (e.g., hospitalization).\n\nThe section excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with serious medical conditions or dependent children aged 13 or younger.\u00a0\n\nUpon request, the CMS may exempt a state from fully implementing these requirements until December 31, 2028. States requesting an exemption must demonstrate good faith efforts to comply with the requirements and provide a detailed timeline for implementation.\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for states and the CMS to implement these requirements.\n\n(Sec. 71120) This section requires, beginning in FY2029, states to institute cost-sharing requirements for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population and whose family income exceeds the federal poverty line. Cost sharing may not exceed $35 for an item or service; total cost sharing for all individuals in a family may not exceed 5% of the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income.\u00a0\n\nThe requirements do not apply to (1) services for which cost sharing is already prohibited (e.g., emergency services); (2) primary care, mental health, or substance use disorder services; or (3) services provided by federally qualified health centers, certified community behavioral health clinics, or rural health clinics. States may allow providers to condition the provision of services upon the payment of any required cost sharing.\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions.\n\nSubchapter E--Expanding Access to Care\n\n(Sec. 71121) This section authorizes additional home and community-based services (HCBS) waivers (also known as Section 1915(c) waivers) for state Medicaid programs beginning on July 1, 2028. States may seek waivers to provide HCBS to individuals without the need for certain determinations as to whether an individual requires hospital or institutional care (as is required for current waivers). States must establish other needs-based criteria for such services.\n\nThe section provides funds for FY2026 for the CMS to implement these provisions. It also provides funds for FY2027 to support state HCBS programs.\n\nChapter 2--Medicare\n\nSubchapter A--Strengthening Eligibility Requirements\n\n(Sec. 71201) This section generally restricts Medicare eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban-Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association migrants lawfully residing in the United States. The Social Security Administration must identify Medicare enrollees who do not meet these requirements and terminate their enrollment within 18 months of this section\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enactment.\n\nSubchapter B--Improving Services for Seniors\n\n(Sec. 71203) This section modifies certain provisions under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program with respect to orphan drugs.\n\nThe Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program requires the CMS to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs under Medicare beginning in 2026. Among other requirements, drugs must have had market approval for at least 7 years (for drug products) or 11 years (for biologics) to qualify for negotiation. The program does not apply to orphan drugs that are approved to treat only one rare disease or condition.\n\nThe section modifies these provisions so as to exclude any period in which a drug was an orphan drug from market approval calculations. It also excludes orphan drugs that are approved to treat more than one rare disease or condition from the program. The changes take effect in 2028.\n\nChapter 3--Health Tax\n\nSubchapter A-- Improving Eligibility Criteria\n\nThis subchapter modifies eligibility and verification requirements for the premium tax credit (which may be used to purchase health insurance on an exchange).\n\nBelow is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.\n\n(Sec. 71301) This section limits a lawfully-present alien\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eligibility for the premium tax credit to\n\nan alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence;an alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant; oran individual who is lawfully residing in the United States in accordance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.(Sec. 71302) This section repeals the rule that allows certain lawfully-present aliens who have a household income of less than 100% of the federal poverty level and are ineligible for Medicaid (based on the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alien status) to claim the premium tax credit.\n\nSubchapter B--Preventing Waste, Fraud, and Abuse\n\nThis subchapter requires verification of certain information supplied by individuals for purposes of determining eligibility for the premium tax credit, limits use of the premium tax credit, and expands recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit.\n\nBelow is a summary of the provisions of this subchapter.\n\n(Sec. 71303) This section requires the verification of certain information for an individual to enroll in a health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange and to generally qualify for the premium tax credit. (Under current law, eligible individuals are allowed a premium tax credit, which applies toward the cost of obtaining health insurance through health insurance exchanges.)\n\nSpecifically, under this section, the following information must be verified\n\nhousehold income and family size,whether the individual is an eligible alien,any health coverage status or eligibility for coverage,place of residence, andany other information required by the Department of the Treasury.(Sec. 71304) This section provides that the premium tax credit is not allowed for any health insurance plan enrolled in through a health insurance exchange during a special enrollment period provided by such exchange (1) on the basis of the relationship between the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected household income to the federal poverty level and (2) not in connection with\u00a0with the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances specified by the Department of Health and Human Services for such purposes.\n\n(Sec. 71305) This section eliminates the limit on the recapture of excess advance payments of the premium tax credit and, accordingly, allows the full amount of any such excess payments to be recaptured. (Under current law, individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level may be required to pay back only a portion of any excess advance payment of the premium tax credit.)\n\nSubchapter C--Enhancing Choice for Patients\n\nThis subchapter expands health savings account (HSA) eligibility requirements.\n\nBelow is a summary of the provisions in this subchapter.\n\n(Sec. 71306) This section allows individuals to establish and make tax-deductible contributions to a health savings account (HSA) if covered by a health insurance plan that provides telehealth and other remote care services without requiring a deductible but otherwise meets the requirements of a high-deductible health plan (HDHP).\n\n(Sec. 71307) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a bronze-level or catastrophic health insurance plan through a health insurance exchange.\n\n(Sec. 71308) This section expands eligibility to make tax-deductible HSA contributions to include individuals who have a direct primary care service arrangement with a fixed period fee that does not exceed $150 a month (or $300 a month if the arrangement covers more than one individual). The amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. (Some limitations apply.)\n\nChapter 4--Protecting Rural Hospitals and Providers\n\n(Sec. 71401) This section provides funds through FY2030 for a program that supports the provision of health care in rural areas. Under the program, states may apply for financial allotments to improve the access and quality of care of services in rural areas, such as through enhanced technology, strategic partnerships, and workforce training.\u00a0\n\nSubtitle C--Increase in Debt Limit\n\n(Sec. 72001) This section increases the statutory debt limit by $5 trillion. (The debt limit is the amount of money that the Department of the Treasury may borrow to fund federal operations.)\n\nSubtitle D--Unemployment\n\n(Sec. 73001) This section prohibits payments under federal unemployment programs to individuals whose wages are $1 million or more. Such programs must include a method for individuals to certify that their income does not exceed this limit. State agencies that administer such programs must verify income information, to the extent possible, and provide for the recovery of any overpayments. \u00a0\n\nTITLE VIII--COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\nThis title makes various changes to higher education, particularly to the federal student loan system.\n\nSubtitle A--Exemption of Certain Assets\n\n(Sec. 80001) This section includes an exemption for certain family farms, small businesses, and commercial fishing businesses\u00a0on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.

In particular, the section establishes the aggregate loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans as $100,000 for a graduate student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education) and $200,000 for a professional student (in addition to the amount borrowed for undergraduate education).\n\nThe section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. In particular, the section sets an annual loan limit of $20,000 that may be borrowed on behalf of a dependent student and a lifetime borrowing limit of $65,000 per dependent student.\n\nThe section also establishes new annual and aggregate loan limits for borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500 for any single borrower across federal loan types (except for Federal Direct PLUS Loans and Parent PLUS Loans).\n\nThe section provides an exception to the loan limits described in this section (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.\n\nThe section allows institutions of higher education (IHEs) to set lower loan limits.\n\nSubtitle C--Loan Repayment\n\nThis subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.\n\n(Sec. 82001) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for new loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.\n\nThe Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan).\n\nThe section includes a transition to income-based repayment plans. Beginning on July 1, 2028, a borrower with a loan that is in a repayment status in accordance with, or an administrative forbearance associated with, an income-contingent repayment plan (e.g., current borrowers on the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan) must begin repaying the loan under a new repayment plan. If a borrower does not select a plan, ED must enroll the borrower in either the Repayment Assistance Plan or the standard repayment plan.\n\n(Sec. 82002) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments beginning on July 1, 2027. It also reduces the total period a borrower may be in forbearance.\n\n(Sec. 82003) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once). However, beginning on July 1, 2027, the borrower must pay a minimum payment amount of $10.\n\n(Sec. 82004) This section allows payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan to count as qualifying payments for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\n(Sec. 82005) This section provides\u00a0funding to ED for administrative costs, including for the costs of student loan servicing.\n\nSubtitle D--Pell Grants\n\nThis subtitle makes changes to Pell Grants.\n\n(Sec. 83001) This section requires foreign income that is exempt from taxation or foreign income for which an individual receives a foreign tax credit to be included in the adjusted gross income calculation for purposes of calculating eligibility for Pell Grants.\n\nStudents with a student aid index that equals or exceeds twice the amount of the total maximum Pell Grant are ineligible for Pell Grants, regardless of their adjusted gross income.\u00a0\n\nThe section\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.\n\n(Sec. 83002) This section requires ED to award Workforce Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs.
