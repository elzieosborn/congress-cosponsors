  <summary date="2025-06-25T17:58:30Z" status="Introduced in House">Honor Farmer Contracts Act

This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to unfreeze funding for agreements and contracts and&#160;prohibits USDA from closing certain offices and service centers without notifying Congress in advance.

Specifically, USDA must (1) unfreeze funding for, and implement, all agreements and contracts entered into by USDA prior to the bill's enactment; and (2) pay all related past due amounts owed by USDA as rapidly as possible.

Further, the bill prohibits USDA from canceling a signed agreement or contract with a farmer or an entity providing assistance to farmers (unless the farmer or entity is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract).

Finally, the bill prohibits USDA from closing Farm Service Agency county offices, Natural Resources Conservation Service field offices, or Rural Development Service Centers without providing written notice and a justification to Congress at least 60 days before the closure.</summary>
