    "text": "Federal Grant Accountability Act\n\nThis bill limits the indirect costs that are allowable under federal research awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs). (Generally, indirect\u00a0costs represent expenses that are not specific to a research project\u00a0but are needed to maintain the infrastructure and administrative support for federally funded research.)\n\nSpecifically, the total amount of indirect costs allowable under a federal research award may not exceed the total amount of indirect costs allowable under private research awards. The Office of Management and Budget must determine the average indirect cost rate applicable to private research awards.\n\nAdditionally, the Government Accountability Office must study and report on (1) the indirect cost rates allowable under federal research awards to IHEs, including awards made by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and other such organizations; and (2) the indirect cost rates allowable under private research awards to IHEs."
