    "text": "Back to Work Act\n\nThis bill limits\u00a0federal agency employees' telework to up to 40% of the work days\u00a0in any pay period and eliminates certain pay increases for teleworking employees.\n\nUnder current law, executive agencies must maintain policies detailing how their employees may work remotely and enter into telework agreements with participating employees. The bill requires telework agreements to cap employees' telework at 40% of the work days\u00a0in a pay period, specify\u00a0that the agency will monitor employees' telework via remote technical methods, and make telework\u00a0subject to annual review by the agency.\u00a0The bill also\u00a0eliminates locality-based and automatic annual pay adjustments for employees with telework agreements.\n\nThe bill authorizes agencies to further restrict the amount of telework permitted based on an employee's specific role or other circumstances (e.g., working with classified information). Agencies may also waive the limitation for inclement weather or\u00a0exigent circumstances or for an employee who (1) is married to a member of the Armed Forces or federal law enforcement officer; (2) holds a position requiring highly specialized experience or frequent travel; or (3) holds a\u00a0position that is difficult to fill.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires annual agency reports to Congress\u00a0describing the effectiveness of agency telework policies. The Government Accountability Office must evaluate the accuracy and thoroughness of each report\u00a0in an accompanying report to Congress."
