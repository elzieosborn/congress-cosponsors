This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to integrate the advancement of sustainable aviation fuels into its programs.

Specifically, this bill includes sustainable aviation fuel as an advanced&#160;biofuel for the purposes of several USDA&#160;bioenergy programs that primarily provide support and incentives for renewable energy projects.

For purposes of these programs, the bill defines sustainable aviation fuel as liquid fuel, the portion of which is not kerosene, which (1) meets specific international standards, (2) is not derived from coprocessing specific materials (e.g., triglycerides) with a non-biomass feedstock, (3) is not derived from palm fatty acid distillates or petroleum, and (4) is certified as having a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction percentage of at least 50% compared with petroleum-based jet fuel (based on specific standards and agreements).

In addition, the bill specifically&#160;includes fostering and advancing sustainable aviation fuels as part of the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program.

Further, USDA must carry out a comprehensive and integrated pursuit of all USDA mission areas for the advancement of sustainable aviation fuels, including through

the identification of opportunities to maximize the development and commercialization of the fuels,supporting rural economic development through improved sustainability for aviation, andadvancing public-private partnerships.</summary>
