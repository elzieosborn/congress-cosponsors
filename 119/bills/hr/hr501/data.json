    "text": "Promoting Resilient Buildings Act of 2025\n\nThis bill authorizes local governments to implement the previous edition of building codes with funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) and Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) programs. It also establishes a pilot program for residential resilience retrofits under the BRIC program.\n\nUnder current law, local governments may use funding provided under the\u00a0BRIC and Safeguarding Tomorrow RLF programs to establish and carry out the latest published editions of relevant building codes and standards. The bill allows local governments to use\u00a0BRIC grant funding to carry out the latest two published editions (i.e., either the current edition of a building code or the previous edition) and requires\u00a0BRIC to consider adoption of either of the latest two editions when determining whether to provide assistance.\u00a0The bill also allows local governments to use loan funding from the Safeguarding Tomorrow RLF program for implementing the latest two published editions of building codes, including amendments government entities make to such codes.\n\nAdditionally, the bill establishes under the BRIC program a pilot program for states and local governments to provide grants to individuals for residential resilience retrofits (i.e., projects that increase a home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilience to natural hazards). To provide this assistance,\u00a0FEMA may use up to 10% of the assistance made available to BRIC applicants annually. The pilot program terminates at the end of FY2028."
