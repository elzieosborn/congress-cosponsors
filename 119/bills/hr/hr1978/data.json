Additionally, DOD must conduct an educational campaign to promote awareness, diagnosis, and treatment of obesity as a disease in the Armed Forces (the\u00a0Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force).\n\nThe bill also requires DOD to include information regarding unmet weight standards in any reports it submits to Congress regarding\u00a0disqualifications for enlistment in, disabilities incurred in, or medical discharges from the Armed Forces.\n\nDOD must submit a report to Congress on the effects of obesity on the readiness of the Armed Forces, including legislative recommendations to address such effects. The Defense Health Agency within DOD must report on the effectiveness of the obesity, food, and nutrition-related programs of DOD in reducing obesity and improving military readiness.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress an analysis of the existing obesity, food, and nutrition-related programs of DOD."
