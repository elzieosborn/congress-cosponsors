  <summary date="2025-02-10T20:18:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2025

This bill prohibits federal agencies from imposing a mandate related to COVID-19 that requires the use of face masks on conveyances (e.g., planes, trains, and buses) and at transportation hubs.

Further, the bill nullifies (1) the emergency&#160;order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on January 29, 2021, that mandates such use of face masks on public and commercial&#160;conveyances and at transportation hubs,&#160;and (2) orders and directives of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that relate to the CDC order.

As background, the CDC and TSA ceased enforcement of the emergency order&#160;following an April 18, 2022, court order. Further, the COVID-19 public health emergency expired on May 11, 2023.</summary>
