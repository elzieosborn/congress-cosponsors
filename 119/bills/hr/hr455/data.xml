This bill prohibits an institution of higher education (IHE) from receiving federal funds for an award year in which the IHE employs an instructor who, while employed at the IHE and providing direct instruction to students, received funds from the Chinese Community Party. An IHE may regain eligibility for federal funds by demonstrating to the Department of Education that it no longer employs such instructor.</summary>
