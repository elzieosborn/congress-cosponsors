The bill defines an\u00a0agricultural producer as an individual who is engaged in farming, ranching, forestry, aquaculture, or another occupation relating to agriculture.\n\nUSDA must also submit a report to Congress that includes a long-term strategy for responding to the challenges faced by agricultural producers that may impact agricultural producers' climate change resilience. The report must also include recommendations for further action by federal departments and agencies that are based on best practices."
