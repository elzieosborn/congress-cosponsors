This bill requires the Industry and Analysis office of the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce to monitor and respond to disruptions in critical industries and supply chains.

Specifically, the office must (1) establish the Supply Chain Resilience Working Group; (2) assess,&#160;map, and model critical supply chains; (3) identify high-priority supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities in critical industries; (4) identify and evaluate the effect of potential supply chain disruptions on market stability; and (5) collaborate with other governmental bodies and key international partners to identify opportunities to reduce supply chain gaps and vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the office, in consultation with the working group and specified nongovernmental entities, must&#160;make recommendations and implement a strategy to improve the security and resiliency of manufacturing capacity and supply chains for critical industries (including critical industries for emerging technologies).

The bill includes various reporting requirements.</summary>
