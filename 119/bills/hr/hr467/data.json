    "text": "Foreign Medical Program Modernization Act of 2025\n\nThis bill expands eligibility for care under the Foreign Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by removing certain eligibility requirements. The program authorizes the VA to furnish care and services to veterans abroad (i.e., outside any state) for the treatment of service-connected disabilities or as part of a Veteran Readiness and Employment rehabilitation program. The bill expands eligibility for care by removing the requirement that a veteran have a service-connected disability or be participating in a rehabilitation program.\n\nThe bill also requires the VA to update its payment system to allow for reimbursements through electronic fund transfer.\n\nUnder the bill, the VA must assess the feasibility and implications of contracting with an appropriate non-VA entity to build a network of non-VA entities to provide hospital care and medical services abroad under the Foreign Medical Program."
