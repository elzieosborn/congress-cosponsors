This bill makes certain&#160;non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who were involved in conduct that would have been in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution if it had occurred in the United States (1) inadmissible for entry into the United States, and (2) deportable.

Specifically, the bill applies to an individual who, while serving as a foreign government official, carried out or was responsible for activity against a U.S. citizen located in the United States that would have violated the First Amendment if committed by a U.S. government official in the United States.</summary>
