    "text": "Promoting Responsible Oversight To Eliminate Communist Teachings for Our Kids Act or the PROTECT Our Kids Act\n\nThis bill prohibits federal education funding for any elementary or secondary school that directly or indirectly receives support from the Chinese government.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits such funding for any school that (1) has a partnership in effect with a cultural or language institute funded by the Chinese government, including a Confucius Institute; (2) operates a learning center supported by the Chinese government (commonly referred to as a Confucius Classroom); or (3) receives support from an individual or entity acting on behalf of the Chinese government, including support in the form of teaching materials, personnel, funds, or other resources. However, the Department of Education (ED) may issue a waiver of the prohibition if a school has an existing contract with one of these entities and the school demonstrates that the contract is for the benefit of the school and promotes the security, stability, and economy of the United States.\n\nThe bill directs ED to provide notice of the bill's requirements to schools, as well as guidance for achieving compliance with the requirements."
