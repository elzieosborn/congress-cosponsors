This bill conditions Medicare payment for remote patient monitoring services on certain requirements.

Specifically, the bill conditions payment on (1) the ability of certain health care practitioners to be available in real time to respond to any detected anomalies; (2) the use of a system that can transmit relevant data in a format that is compatible with electronic health records, as needed; and (3) the reporting of such data, as required by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), to evaluate any cost savings as a&#160;result of such services.

The bill also establishes a floor for certain payment calculations with respect to such services.

The CMS must report on cost savings realized and expenses incurred from the use of such services over a four-year period.
