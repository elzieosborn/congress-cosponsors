  <summary date="2025-06-13T19:49:47Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the consent of the chief executive officers (e.g., governors) of involved states when the President or Department of Defense orders National Guard units to perform training or other duty in such states. Under the bill, the term state&#160;includes the District of Columbia and territories or possessions of the United States. The bill also subjects the ordered training or duty to the limitations of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the military for civil law enforcement purposes.</summary>
