This bill allows airport sponsors to use funds from Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants for storage facilities for aircraft deicing equipment and fluids.

Under current law, airports may use&#160;AIP funds for structures and equipment that are used to deice&#160;aircraft, but not for the associated storage facilities.</summary>
