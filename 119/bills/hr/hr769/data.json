    "text": "All Aboard Act\n\nThis bill requires Amtrak to issue refunds to rail passengers for the purchase price of rail\u00a0passenger transportation that is cancelled or delayed due to a failure of Amtrak.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Transportation (DOT) must issue regulations requiring Amtrak to issue full refunds to passengers\u00a0for the purchase price of the covered rail passenger transportation if there is a cancellation or a delay of more than three hours in the journey completion time that is due to a failure of Amtrak.\n\nUnder the bill,\u00a0covered rail passenger\u00a0transportation\u00a0means (1) rail passenger transportation provided by, or on behalf of, Amtrak; or (2) commuter rail passenger transportation\u00a0that travels over Amtrak-owned rails, regardless of whether it is\u00a0provided by Amtrak or other rail carriers.\n\nThe regulations must include procedures for (1) determining if a cancellation or delay is due to a failure of Amtrak, and (2) Amtrak to dispute that a cancellation or delay is subject to the refund requirements.\n\nThe bill\u00a0prohibits Amtrak from receiving federal funds for any period during which DOT determines that Amtrak is\u00a0noncompliant with these requirements.\n\nAmtrak must submit a report to Congress on alternative asset maintenance strategies to replace\u00a0the run-to-fail maintenance model (i.e., using passenger rail equipment and infrastructure until it no longer works or exceeds its estimated lifespan), including the cost of the strategies. Within two years of this bill's enactment,\u00a0Amtrak must (1) stop using a run-to-fail maintenance model, and (2) implement a new asset maintenance strategy.\u00a0"
