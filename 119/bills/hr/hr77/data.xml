  <summary date="2025-02-12T13:52:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Midnight Rules Relief Act

This bill allows Congress to disapprove multiple regulations under one joint resolution of disapproval if the regulations were submitted for review during a portion of the final year of a President's term.

 Under current law, the Congressional Review Act generally&#160;provides for a period of additional review during the succeeding Congress for regulations that were submitted during the last 60 legislative days of the prior Congress. However, each joint resolution may disapprove of only one regulation.</summary>
