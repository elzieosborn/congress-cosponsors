    "text": "Natural Disaster Recovery Program Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding sources for unmet needs caused by major disasters, expands FEMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assistance for housing and home repair, and requires certain considerations in FEMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations on presidential emergency/disaster declarations.\n\nThe bill establishes the National Disaster Recovery Reserve Fund for FEMA to provide grants to states and Indian tribal governments for unmet need. The bill defines unmet need as any necessary expense for activities related to a declared major disaster, including disaster relief or resilience activities. In addition, the bill authorizes FEMA to set aside funding from the Disaster Relief Fund to provide grants to states and Indian tribal governments for unmet needs resulting from a declared disaster, including home repair, economic recovery measures, and other services assisting disaster victims.\u00a0\n\nAlso, the bill makes the following changes regarding housing assistance:\n\nauthorizes FEMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Individuals and Households Program (IHP) to provide home repair assistance directly to homeowners when there is a lack of available housing resources,\u00a0expands IHP home repair assistance for persons with disabilities,\u00a0extends the maximum duration of\u00a0IHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct housing assistance from 18 to 24 months,authorizes\u00a0IHP permanent housing construction where FEMA considers it a cost-effective alternative, and\u00a0authorizes minor home repairs in the essential assistance federal agencies may provide following a disaster.\u00a0Additionally, the bill requires FEMA to give greater weight to local impacts, and events over the past five years, when making recommendations to the President regarding emergency or major disaster declarations."
