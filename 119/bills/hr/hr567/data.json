    "text": "Expanding Labor Representation in the Workforce System Act\n\nThis bill increases from 20% to 30% the workforce representation on state and local workforce development boards.\n\nWorkforce development boards perform a variety of functions to carry out the programs and services authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, including by developing and implementing plans for workforce development and investment activities. \u00a0\n\nCurrent law specifies that boards must include representatives of labor organizations, among others with relevant expertise. The bill specifies that labor organizations include organizations that\n\nare considered labor organizations based on the definition included in the National Labor Relations Act (e.g., unions); are composed of labor organizations (e.g., a labor union federation or a state or municipal labor body); or would be considered labor organizations but for the fact that the organization represents agricultural laborers\u00a0or individuals employed by a federal agency, a government\u00a0corporation, a Federal Reserve Bank, a state or local government, or an employer that is subject to the Railway Labor Act.\u00a0"
