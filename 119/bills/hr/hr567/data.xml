  <summary date="2025-07-31T13:27:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Expanding Labor Representation in the Workforce System Act

This bill increases from 20% to 30% the workforce representation on state and local workforce development boards.

Workforce development boards perform a variety of functions to carry out the programs and services authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, including by developing and implementing plans for workforce development and investment activities. &#160;

Current law specifies that boards must include representatives of labor organizations, among others with relevant expertise. The bill specifies that labor organizations include organizations that

are considered labor organizations based on the definition included in the National Labor Relations Act (e.g., unions); are composed of labor organizations (e.g., a labor union federation or a state or municipal labor body); or would be considered labor organizations but for the fact that the organization represents agricultural laborers&#160;or individuals employed by a federal agency, a government&#160;corporation, a Federal Reserve Bank, a state or local government, or an employer that is subject to the Railway Labor Act.&#160;</summary>
