    "text": "Legislative Branch Agencies Clarification Act\n\nThis bill revises the procedures for appointing and removing the Librarian of Congress, the Director of the Government Publishing Office (GPO), and the Register of Copyrights.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Librarian and the Director of GPO to be appointed by a bipartisan congressional commission, based on procedures outlined by the bill and without regard to political\u00a0affiliation. (Currently, these positions are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.) The Librarian and the Director of GPO may only be removed from office by a majority vote of the majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires the Librarian and the Director of GPO to each appoint a deputy within a set time frame and outlines related procedures.\n\nThe bill removes the Library of Congress's (LOC's) supervisory authority over the Copyright Office.\u00a0LOC and other legislative agencies may provide support services to the Copyright Office.\n\nThe bill requires the Register of Copyrights to be (1) a U.S. citizen with a background and experience in copyright law, and (2) appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. (Currently, the Register is appointed by the Librarian.) The bill limits the term of office for the Register to 10 years, but the individual may be\u00a0reappointed.\n\nThe bill also requires GPO to establish and maintain a human capital management system and outlines the requirements for the system."
