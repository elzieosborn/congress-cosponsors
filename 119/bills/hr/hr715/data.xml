  <summary date="2025-04-23T13:03:24Z" status="Introduced in House">BNA Fairness Act

This bill excludes from gross income (for federal income tax purposes) the basic needs allowance received by eligible members of the Armed Forces.

Under current law, members of the Armed Forces may be eligible to receive the basic needs allowance (additional monthly payment) if (1) they have completed initial training, (2) they have at least one dependent, and (3) their total household income does not exceed 200% of the federal poverty level (based on the location and number of individuals in the household). Further, under current law, certain qualified military benefits may be excluded from gross income. However, the basic needs allowance is not included within the definition of qualified military benefits and must be included in gross income for federal tax purposes.

Under the bill, the definition of qualified military benefits that may be excluded from gross income is expanded to include the basic needs allowance.</summary>
