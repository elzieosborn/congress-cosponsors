This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to establish procedures that allow an eligible taxpayer to elect to receive by direct deposit a replacement of a federal tax refund amount that was originally issued as a paper check and was lost or stolen. (Currently, taxpayers eligible to receive a replacement of a lost or stolen federal tax refund check are generally issued another paper check.)</summary>
