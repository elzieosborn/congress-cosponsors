This bill establishes an Office of Policy Development and Cybersecurity within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to analyze and develop policies related to internet and communications technologies.

Specific activities of the office include, for example, developing policies that promote (1) innovation, competition, and other elements of the communications, media, and technology markets; (2) security and resilience to cybersecurity incidents while fostering innovation; and (3) commercialization of communications technologies.

The existing Associate Administrator for Policy Analysis and Development within NTIA must be redesignated as Associate Administrator for Policy Development and Cybersecurity, and must serve as head of the office.&#160;</summary>
