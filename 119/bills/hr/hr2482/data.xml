  <summary date="2025-04-23T18:31:32Z" status="Introduced in House">National Telecommunications and Information Administration Reauthorization Act of 2025 or the NTIA Reauthorization Act of 2025

This bill reauthorizes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) through FY2026 and makes certain changes to its leadership structure.

Specifically, the bill promotes the head of the NTIA, currently the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, to the role of Under Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information. The bill also promotes the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.&#160;

Further, the bill provides statutory authority for two existing offices within NTIA&#226;&#8364;&#8221;the Office of Spectrum Management and the Office of International Affairs.&#160;

The bill also repeals certain outdated or expired NTIA reporting requirements and consolidates certain remaining reporting requirements into one annual report to Congress.&#160;

Finally, the bill extends the obligation of the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Commerce to audit the Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program through FY2024.&#160;</summary>
