    "text": "Wireless Broadband Competition and Efficient Deployment Act\n\nThis bill exempts\u00a0projects that involve the installation or modification of certain wireless communications facilities\u00a0from specified federal environmental and historic preservation review requirements.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill exempts from review projects that involve\u00a0(1) the mounting or installation of an eligible personal wireless service facility with an eligible personal wireless service facility that exists when an authorization request for the mounting or installation is filed with a state or local government or an Indian tribe; or (2) the modification of an eligible personal wireless service facility.\u00a0To be exempt, the projects must also require a permit or other authorization from, or are otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of, the Federal Communications Commission.\u00a0\n\nUnder the bill, an eligible personal wireless service facility means an antenna, apparatus, or transmitting device and associated equipment for the provision of personal wireless communications service.\u00a0\n\nThe bill specifies that these projects are not considered major federal actions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or undertakings under the National Historic Preservation Act, thus exempting such projects from the review procedures required under those acts."
