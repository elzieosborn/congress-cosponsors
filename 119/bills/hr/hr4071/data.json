In particular, officers and agents may provide support for\n\nmonitoring, locating, and deterring the smuggling of illegal drugs, persons, or goods into the United States;tracking terrorist or other threats to the United States;emergency humanitarian efforts; andlaw enforcement capacity-building efforts.The bill also allows CBP to expend appropriated funds to pay claims for\u00a0money damages made against the United\u00a0States\u00a0that arise in a foreign country in connection with CBP operations. This includes money damages for injury, loss of property, personal injury, or death caused by certain acts or omissions of an employee of the agency while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment. Under current law, acts occurring in foreign countries are excepted from the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nClaims made under the bill must be made no more than two years after the date of the incident. The authority to expend funds for such damages expires five years after the date of enactment of the bill.\u00a0"
