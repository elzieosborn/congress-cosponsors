    "text": "Save Americans from the Fentanyl Emergency Act or the SAFE Act\n\nThis bill\u00a0permanently\u00a0places fentanyl-related substances as a class into schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. A schedule I controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that has a high potential for abuse; has no currently accepted medical value; and is subject to regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act. Fentanyl-related substances are currently regulated under schedule I through a temporary order issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The temporary order expires on March 31, 2025.\n\nIt limits mandatory minimum penalties for certain offenses involving fentanyl-related substances, establishes a process to deschedule or remove certain fentanyl-related substances that have a low potential for abuse, and allows federal courts to vacate or reduce sentences for convictions involving a fentanyl-related substance that is descheduled or moved to a schedule other than schedule I or II.\n\nThe bill establishes a new, alternative registration process for schedule I research. It also makes other changes to registration requirements for conducting research with controlled substances, including\n\npermitting a single registration for related research sites in certain circumstances,waiving the requirement for a new inspection in certain situations, andallowing a registered researcher to perform certain manufacturing activities with small quantities of a substance without obtaining a manufacturing registration.Finally, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to analyze the implementation and impact of permanently placing fentanyl-related substances into schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act."
