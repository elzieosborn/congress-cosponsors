    "text": "United States Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025\n\nThis bill reauthorizes the U.S. Grain Standards Act (USGSA) through FY2030 and modifies\u00a0authorities under the act.\n\nUnder the USGSA, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) establishes official marketing or quality standards for certain grains (e.g., corn, soybeans, and wheat), and the Federal Grain Inspection Service conducts and supervises official grain inspections and weighing services. Most provisions of the act are permanently authorized; however, several expire on September 30, 2025.\n\nSpecifically, the bill reauthorizes through FY2030\n\nUSDA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority to collect and spend fees for\u00a0inspection and weighing services;the 30% cap on administrative and supervisory costs which may be incurred for services performed, with exceptions;standardization and compliance activities and monitoring of foreign ports; andthe Grain Inspection Advisory Committee.The costs associated with equipment and the development of technology are excluded from the current 30% cap for administrative and supervisory costs for services.\n\nThe bill also includes a technical change\u00a0that specifies\u00a0fees are part of a\u00a0trust fund, instead of the current\u00a0fund.\n\nUnder the bill, USDA may inspect domestic non-export grain that is loaded or unloaded at an export port, as needed.\n\nFurther, USDA must prioritize the adoption of improved grain grading technology to provide for efficient, accurate, and consistent grading of grain.\n\nAdditional revisions include\n\nallowing USDA to work in cooperation with official agencies in a continuing research program,\u00a0expanding reporting requirements, andallowing a Grain Inspection Advisory Committee member to serve until a new member is appointed."
