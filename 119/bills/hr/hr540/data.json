(The SOC system is a federal statistical standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data.)\n\nOMB must consider the separate code for public safety telecommunicators as part of the first revision process of the SOC system occurring after this bill is enacted. If OMB decides not to establish the separate code, OMB must submit a report to Congress explaining why the code was not established.\u00a0"
