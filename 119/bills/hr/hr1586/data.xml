This bill requires that only women-owned small businesses that have been certified by a federal agency, state government, or national certifying entity approved by the Small Business Administration (SBA) are included when calculating whether a federal agency has met its contracting goals with respect to such businesses during a fiscal year.

Certain self-certified, women-owned small businesses that have filed an application for certification are deemed to have been certified until the SBA or national certifying entity makes a determination with respect to the certification of such business.

The SBA must provide a briefing each quarter about specified aspects of the process of certifying women-owned small businesses and implementing the requirements of the bill.</summary>
