    "text": "Climate Agricultural Conservation Practices Act\n\nThis bill requires the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to consider climate benefits in reviews or revisions of its conservation practice standards. Climate benefits include\u00a0a reduction in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, an increase in carbon sequestration, or\u00a0mitigation against (or adaptation to) increased weather volatility.\n\nAs background, NRCS\u00a0administers most of the Department of Agriculture conservation programs, which assist producers and landowners who wish to practice conservation on agricultural lands. The NRCS conservation practice standards\u00a0provide guidance and set out minimum quality criteria for implementing federally funded conservation practices."
