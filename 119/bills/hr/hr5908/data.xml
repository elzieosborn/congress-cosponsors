This bill requires federal agencies to submit reports to Congress&#160;regarding employees who were furloughed during a lapse in appropriations (i.e, government shutdown), the total number of employees, and the cost of salaries.&#160;

Specifically, each federal agency must submit a report to specified congressional committees&#160;within 30 days of the end of a lapse in appropriations. The report must include specified details regarding

the total number of employees (including contract employees) employed by the agency before the lapse began,the total number of employees who were furloughed during the lapse,the total number of employees who were not furloughed during the lapse, and&#160;the total annual cost of the salaries for each group of employees.&#160;The report must be submitted in an unclassified form, but it may include a classified annex. Each congressional committee that receives a report must publish the report on its website within 30 days.&#160;

The bill also requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to submit a report to Congress&#160;regarding the economic effects of each lapse in appropriations.&#160;CBO must submit the report within 30 days of the end of a lapse in appropriations and make the report available on its website.&#160;</summary>
