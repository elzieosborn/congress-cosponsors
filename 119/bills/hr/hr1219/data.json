Reimbursements from an FSA or HRA for nonmedical expenses generally are not allowed and distributions from an HSA or Archer MSA for nonmedical expenses generally are taxed as income and may be subject to an additional penalty.\n\nUnder the bill, the definition of qualified medical expenses is expanded to include toothbrushes (manual or electric), water flossers, and oral health products.\n\nThe bill defines an oral health product as an over-the-counter product that is (1) used for preventing or treating dental cavities, plaque, or gingivitis;\u00a0(2) suitable for topical administration to the teeth or gums; and (3) generally recognized as safe and effective.\u00a0"
