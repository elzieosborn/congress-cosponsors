  <summary date="2025-05-01T19:53:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthening the Quad Act

This bill directs the Department of State to seek to establish a working group with Japan, Australia, and India to facilitate closer cooperation on shared interests and values. (The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the Quad, is a coalition comprised of the United States and these three countries.)

The bill also requires the State Department to report to Congress a strategy for bolstering engagement and cooperation with the Quad. The strategy shall&#160;summarize&#160;current and past Quad initiatives, including those to promote broad-based and inclusive economic growth, technology cooperation, energy innovation, and resilient supply chains.&#160;The strategy shall also recommend (1) how Congress can help address certain barriers to implementing and expanding Quad cooperation, (2) new authorities needed to strengthen U.S. leadership in and contributions to Quad initiatives, and (3) additional resources needed to expand successful initiatives.</summary>
