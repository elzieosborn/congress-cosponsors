This bill excludes certain requests to modify an existing wireless tower or base station&#160;from specified environmental and historic preservation review requirements. Specifically, the bill applies to&#160;certain requests to modify an existing wireless tower or base station by collocating, removing, or replacing transmission equipment.

In particular, the bill specifies that such projects are not considered major federal&#160;actions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or undertakings under the National Historic Preservation Act. This excludes the projects from relevant reviews required under those acts.</summary>
