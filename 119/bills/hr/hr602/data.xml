  <summary date="2025-03-11T15:54:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner in VA Hospitals Act of 2025 or the SANE Act of 2025

This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to employ at each of its hospitals and urgent care facilities at least one sexual assault nurse examiner or a health care provider who is qualified to conduct a sexual assault forensic examination.

The bill also provides that after examining an individual for sexual assault, a VA health care provider must verbally refer the individual to mental health care services furnished by the VA in a VA hospital or by a non-VA provider under the Veterans Community Care Program if the wait time for services at a VA hospital exceeds 30 days.

In providing such duties related to sexual assault care, the VA must ensure that there is no reduction in, or negative effect on, the patient care responsibilities otherwise carried out by its employees.</summary>
