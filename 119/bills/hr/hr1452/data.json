    "text": "Ending the Cycle of Dependency Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes work requirements for adults ages 19 to 59 under Medicaid. It also extends work requirements to additional individuals under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits federal Medicaid payment for adults ages 19 to 59 unless these individuals (1) work at least 80 hours per month or have a monthly income that is at least equal to the federal minimum wage multiplied by 80 hours, (2) participate in a work program for at least 80 hours per month, (3) engage in community service for at least 80 hours per month, or (4) participate in a combination of the aforementioned activities for at least 80 hours per month. States may choose to disenroll individuals from Medicaid if they do not meet these requirements.\u00a0\n\nThe bill excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with disabilities, who care for children under the age of six, or who are enrolled in an educational program at least half-time.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also modifies work requirements under SNAP so as to require individuals ages 56 to 60, those with children ages 6 and older, homeless individuals, and certain former foster youth to meet the work requirements for SNAP (these individuals are currently exempt from work requirements). Additionally, states may no longer request to waive work requirements for individuals in areas with high unemployment rates or that lack a sufficient number of available jobs."
