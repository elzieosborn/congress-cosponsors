This bill requires the Administration on Aging to submit to Congress an annual report that (1) aggregates reports submitted to the administration by state long-term care ombudsman offices for the year, and (2) summarizes the findings of such reports. &#160;

(State long-term care ombudsman programs investigate and respond to complaints by and on behalf of residents in long-term care facilities, including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other adult care homes. Each state long-term care ombudsman office is required to submit an annual report to the administration including data related to complaints and conditions in long-term care facilities and an evaluation of the problems experienced by long-term care residents.)&#160;</summary>
