    "text": "Communications Security Act\n\nThis bill provides statutory authority for a council established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide advice regarding the security, reliability, and interoperability of communications networks. (This advice is currently provided by the FCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council.)\n\nThe bill specifies that the FCC may designate an existing advisory committee to fulfill this role, provided the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership is modified, as necessary, to comply with membership requirements set forth in the bill.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the council to include, to the extent practicable, representatives of companies in the communications industry; public interest organizations or academic institutions; and federal, state, tribal, and local governments (with at least one member representing each level of government). Members are to be selected by the FCC's chair\u00a0and generally may not include representatives of entities owned or controlled by, or subject to the influence of, a foreign adversary, or otherwise deemed to pose a threat to U.S. national security.\u00a0\n\nUnder current law, federal advisory committees\u00a0must generally terminate after two years unless they are renewed or a statute specifies a different termination date. However, the bill exempts the council from this requirement."
