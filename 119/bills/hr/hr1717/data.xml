  <summary date="2025-04-02T14:57:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Communications Security Act

This bill provides statutory authority for a council established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide advice regarding the security, reliability, and interoperability of communications networks. (This advice is currently provided by the FCC&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council.)

The bill specifies that the FCC may designate an existing advisory committee to fulfill this role, provided the committee&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s membership is modified, as necessary, to comply with membership requirements set forth in the bill.&#160;

Specifically, the bill requires the council to include, to the extent practicable, representatives of companies in the communications industry; public interest organizations or academic institutions; and federal, state, tribal, and local governments (with at least one member representing each level of government). Members are to be selected by the FCC's chair&#160;and generally may not include representatives of entities owned or controlled by, or subject to the influence of, a foreign adversary, or otherwise deemed to pose a threat to U.S. national security.&#160;

Under current law, federal advisory committees&#160;must generally terminate after two years unless they are renewed or a statute specifies a different termination date. However, the bill exempts the council from this requirement.</summary>
