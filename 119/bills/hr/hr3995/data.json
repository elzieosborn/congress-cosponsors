State Medicaid programs may set premiums and cost-sharing requirements for such coverage in accordance with specified limitations.\n\nThe bill also (1) provides the enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) to every state that expands Medicaid coverage for individuals who are newly eligible under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, regardless of when such expansion takes place; and (2) requires state Medicaid programs to cover comprehensive sexual and\u00a0reproductive health care services, including abortion services."
