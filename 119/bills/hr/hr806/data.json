(Generally, an individual who is convicted of a felony under DC laws serves the prison term in a BOP facility.)\n\nEvery 90 days, BOP must provide DC with each individual's name, age, inmate registration number assigned by BOP, and scheduled release date, as well as the facility where the individual is housed.\n\nThe information may be disclosed to (1) DC government agencies that are not law enforcement agencies; (2) legal representatives of incarcerated individuals, and (3) organizations that provide legal representation in criminal matters or in matters related to the reentry of formerly incarcerated individuals into their communities."
