This bill expands who may be considered an accredited investor for purposes of participating in private offerings of securities. Certain unregistered securities may only be offered to accredited investors.

Specifically, the bill allows an individual to qualify by certifying to the issuer of securities that the individual understands the risks of investment in private issuers. Currently, accredited investors must satisfy certain requirements indicating their reduced exposure to financial risk, including those related to income, net worth, or knowledge and experience.</summary>
