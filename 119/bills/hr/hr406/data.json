(This definition is the same as the working definition of anti-Semitism from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.)\n\nAdditionally, the IHE must include in such documents a statement that\u00a0anti-Semitic conduct is prohibited on campus and that such conduct may result in expulsion or termination of employment."
