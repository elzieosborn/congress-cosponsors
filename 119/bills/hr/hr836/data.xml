This bill requires the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to (1) jointly evaluate the container aerial firefighting system to assess its use to mitigate and suppress wildfires,&#160;and (2) report on the results of the evaluation to Congress.

The system allows for the use of airdrop-capable disposable containers of water or fire retardant in order to increase the number of airlift assets available for wildfire emergencies.</summary>
