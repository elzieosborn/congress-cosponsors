This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prioritize the processing of applications for certain rural broadband expansion projects that are located in areas with the shortest construction seasons (e.g., areas with long winters and heavy snowfall).

Specifically, the FCC must prioritize processing such applications for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) Phase II auction, which aims to facilitate the provision of broadband service to&#160;areas&#160;that are&#160;partially served. (The RDOF program's first phase, which is focused on broadband service for wholly unserved areas, is underway.)</summary>
