This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a 6G Task Force to report on industry-led efforts to set standards for sixth-generation wireless technology and the possible uses and limitations of such technology, among other topics. The task force must publish and solicit public comment on a draft of the report, and must take such comments into consideration in preparing the final report. &#160;

Members of the task force must include, to the extent practicable, representatives of companies in the communications industry; public interest organizations or academic institutions; and federal, state, tribal, and local governments (with at least one member representing each level of government). Members are to be selected by the chair of the FCC, and generally may not include representatives of entities owned or controlled by, or subject to the influence of, a foreign adversary, or otherwise deemed to pose a threat to U.S. national security.</summary>
