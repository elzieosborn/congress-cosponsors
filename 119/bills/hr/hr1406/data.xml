  <summary date="2025-08-05T16:15:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Lung Cancer Screening and Prevention Act of 2025

This bill authorizes Medicare coverage of additional types of lung cancer screening tests that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, regardless of whether they are recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must set coverage and payment limits for such tests. (Currently, Medicare covers screening tests for the early detection of lung cancer if they are recommended by the task force.)</summary>
