This bill expands the awards program for cost-saving identifications by federal employees of fraud, waste, or mismanagement to include identifications of certain operational expenses that are wasteful (i.e., that are identified as wasteful by an employee and that an agency determines are not required for the purposes for which the amounts were made available). An agency must propose any identified wasteful expenses for rescission.

The bill also doubles the maximum cash award that may be made under the program.</summary>
