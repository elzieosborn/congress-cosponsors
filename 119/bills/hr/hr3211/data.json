Under this program, the maximum aggregate loan amount of a precision agriculture loan\u00a0is $500,000.\n\nPrecision agriculture refers to managing, tracking, or reducing crop or livestock production inputs, including seed, feed, fertilizer, chemicals, water, and time, at a heightened level of spatial and temporal granularity to improve efficiencies, reduce waste, and maintain environmental quality."
