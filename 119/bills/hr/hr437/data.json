    "text": "Support Neighborhoods Offset Winter Damage Act of 2025 or the SNOW Act of 2025\n\nThis bill authorizes Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant funding for winter storm hazard mitigation and requires FEMA rulemaking to expand\u00a0assistance for winter storms. It also increases the federal cost share for various FEMA grants, for any hazard type, in rural or disadvantaged areas.\n\nThe bill specifically authorizes the use of grant funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program\u00a0to reduce the risk of future damage in areas affected by winter storms, such as by\u00a0acquiring snow removal equipment.\u00a0\n\nAlso, under current FEMA policy, in determining eligibility and recommending a presidential major disaster declaration for a snowstorm, FEMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considerations include whether data shows record (or near record) snowfall and whether estimated statewide costs meet applicable thresholds. The bill requires FEMA to create regulations waiving these eligibility requirements for a major disaster declaration for a snowstorm in certain circumstances. FEMA must also create regulations to provide certain\u00a0assistance for winter storms, including for debris removal and specified infrastructure, as well as individual and emergency assistance when the state determines the storm exceeds state and local capacity.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, for any hazard type, the bill requires FEMA to increase the federal cost share from 75% to 90% for certain assistance provided in rural or disadvantaged areas.\u00a0It also authorizes\u00a0an increased HMGP federal cost share amount from 75% to 90% for assistance\u00a0in rural or disadvantaged areas.\u00a0"
