This bill provides FY2026 appropriations to continue servicing loans made under certain Small Business Administration (SBA) loan programs if there is a lapse in discretionary appropriations (i.e., government shutdown) in FY2026.

If there is a lapse in FY2026 appropriations for the SBA, the bill provides specified appropriations to pay for the salaries and expenses necessary to continue servicing any loans made under several loan programs authorized by the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.

The bill provides the appropriations for any 30-day period in which there is a lapse in SBA appropriations and on a pro-rated basis if the lapse is less than 30 days.</summary>
