    "text": "Agricultural and Forestry Hauling Efficiency Act\n\nThis bill allows Virginia to increase the vehicle weight limit for covered agricultural vehicles traveling on interstate highways to 90,000 pounds. Specifically, Virginia may provide a special permit for these covered agricultural vehicles\u00a0to operate\u00a0on interstate highways in Virginia.\n\nThe term\u00a0covered agricultural\u00a0vehicle\u00a0means a vehicle that is transporting (1) unprocessed agricultural crops used for food, feed, or fiber; or (2) raw or unfinished forest products, including logs, pulpwood, rough-sawn green lumber, biomass, or wood chips.\n\nUnder current law, there is an\u00a080,000 pound overall gross vehicle weight limit\u00a0for interstate highways,\u00a0with exceptions. Virginia allows certain agricultural vehicles that do not exceed 90,000 pounds to travel on Virginia highways that are not part of the interstate highway system."
