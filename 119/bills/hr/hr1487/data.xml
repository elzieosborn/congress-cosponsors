This bill allows Virginia to increase the vehicle weight limit for covered agricultural vehicles traveling on interstate highways to 90,000 pounds. Specifically, Virginia may provide a special permit for these covered agricultural vehicles&#160;to operate&#160;on interstate highways in Virginia.

The term&#160;covered agricultural&#160;vehicle&#160;means a vehicle that is transporting (1) unprocessed agricultural crops used for food, feed, or fiber; or (2) raw or unfinished forest products, including logs, pulpwood, rough-sawn green lumber, biomass, or wood chips.

Under current law, there is an&#160;80,000 pound overall gross vehicle weight limit&#160;for interstate highways,&#160;with exceptions. Virginia allows certain agricultural vehicles that do not exceed 90,000 pounds to travel on Virginia highways that are not part of the interstate highway system.</summary>
