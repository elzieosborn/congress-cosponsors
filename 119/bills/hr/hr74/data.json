    "text": "Freedom for Families Act\n\nThis bill allows individuals to establish and contribute to a health savings account (HSA) without being enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), increases HSA contribution limits, and allows tax-free distributions from an HSA during a period of qualified caregiving.\n\nUnder current law, individuals may establish and contribute to an HSA if they are covered under an HSA-eligible HDHP. For 2025, HSA contributions are limited to $4,300 for self-only coverage or $8,550 for family coverage (adjusted annually). Individuals who are at least\u00a055 years\u00a0old may make an additional HSA contribution of up to $1,000 per year. Further, under current law, HSA distributions are tax-free if used to pay for qualified medical expenses.\u00a0\n\nThe bill eliminates the HDHP coverage requirement for purposes of an HSA.\n\nThe bill also increases the HSA annual contribution limit to $9,000 for individuals or $18,000 for joint filers\u00a0(adjusted annually)\u00a0and eliminates the additional contribution for individuals\u00a0who are at least 55 years old.\n\nFinally, the bill excludes HSA distributions during a period of qualified caregiving from gross income. The bill defines period of qualified caregiving as any period during which an individual is on leave or not employed due to\n\nthe birth or adoption of a child;placement of a foster child;caring for a family member with a serious health condition;an inability to work due to a serious health condition; orcertain emergencies related to a spouse, child, or parent on covered active duty with the Armed Forces.\u00a0"
