  <summary date="2025-09-11T20:20:56Z" status="Introduced in House">Make the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful Act&#160;

This bill establishes a commission in the executive branch to advise on&#160;certain criminal and immigration matters in the District of Columbia (DC). It also establishes a federal program to ensure that commonly visited areas in DC are cleaned and maintained.&#160;(On March 27, 2025, President Donald Trump&#160;issued an executive order titled&#160;Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful, which established a similar task force and program.)

First, the&#160;bill establishes a commission made up of representatives from the U.S. Attorneys' Offices for DC, Maryland, and Virginia; specified federal agencies; and other designated federal&#160;entities.&#160;The commission&#160;must recommend actions to, among other tasks,&#160;address enforcement of federal immigration law in DC, facilitate the provision of federal resources to reduce crime, and assist with recruitment and retention of DC's Metropolitan Police Department officers.

Next, the bill directs the Department of the Interior to establish a program to coordinate and maintain the cleanliness of commonly visited areas in DC,&#160;including monuments, parks, and roads. The program must also restore damaged or removed federal public monuments and similar properties.

The bill's provisions terminate on January 2, 2029.</summary>
