  <summary date="2025-05-01T21:14:48Z" status="Introduced in House">DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act

This bill restricts funding to an institution of higher education (IHE) that has a relationship with a Confucius Institute,&#160;Thousand Talents Program, or Chinese entity of concern. The bill defines (1)&#160;Confucius Institute as a cultural institute funded by the Chinese government; (2) Thousand Talents Program as&#160;any technological or educational program funded or administered by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; and (3)&#160;Chinese entity of concern as generally any university or college in China that is involved in China's military, police, or intelligence activities.

Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must ensure that an IHE that has awarded a contract to, entered into an agreement with, or received an in-kind donation or gift from a Confucius Institute, Thousand Talents Program, or Chinese entity of concern&#160;is ineligible to receive any funds from DHS, unless the IHE terminates the relationship. The IHE may regain eligibility for these funds upon termination of the relationship.</summary>
