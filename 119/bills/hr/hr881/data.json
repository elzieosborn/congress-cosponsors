The bill defines (1)\u00a0Confucius Institute as a cultural institute funded by the Chinese government; (2) Thousand Talents Program as\u00a0any technological or educational program funded or administered by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; and (3)\u00a0Chinese entity of concern as generally any university or college in China that is involved in China's military, police, or intelligence activities.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must ensure that an IHE that has awarded a contract to, entered into an agreement with, or received an in-kind donation or gift from a Confucius Institute, Thousand Talents Program, or Chinese entity of concern\u00a0is ineligible to receive any funds from DHS, unless the IHE terminates the relationship. The IHE may regain eligibility for these funds upon termination of the relationship."
