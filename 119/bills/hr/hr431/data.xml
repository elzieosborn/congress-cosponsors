This bill requires the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to pay a citizen for late payment fees or penalties incurred due to late delivery of mail by USPS.

Late delivery of mail means that (1) USPS received a bill or notice of bill at least 12 days prior to the payment due date and delivered such bill or notice of bill less than 6 days prior to the payment due date; or (2) USPS received a payment at least 5 days prior to the payment due date and delivered such payment after the due date.&#160;

USPS is not required to pay a citizen for late payment fees or penalties when a bill, notice of bill, or payment is delayed for reasons outside of USPS control (for example, if a major disaster or emergency declared by the President caused the delay).</summary>
