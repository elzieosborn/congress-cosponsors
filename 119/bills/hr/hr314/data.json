Eligible nonprofit organizations are those located in a U.S. state (including the District of Columbia or a U.S. commonwealth, territory, or possession) or federally recognized Indian tribe that has more than 20% of individuals living below the poverty line.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires an executive agency, during that time frame, to reduce any cost-sharing requirement by 25% for grants made directly to an eligible nonprofit."
