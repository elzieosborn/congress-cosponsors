  <summary date="2025-05-05T15:57:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act of 2025

This bill requires the President to impose sanctions on persons (individuals and entities) involved in forced organ trafficking and authorizes the Department of State to deny or revoke the passports of individuals convicted of certain crimes related to organ trafficking.

Specifically, the President must report to Congress a list of persons that facilitate (1) forced organ harvesting, or (2) trafficking in persons for organ harvesting. For each person on the list, the President must impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions.

Furthermore, the State Department may deny or revoke the passport of an individual who has been convicted of a federal crime of knowingly transferring any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation, if the individual (1) is subject to imprisonment or supervised release resulting from that conviction, and (2) used a passport or crossed an international border when committing that crime.</summary>
