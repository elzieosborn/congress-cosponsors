This bill allows outside nonprofit organizations to meet with federal officials in the District of Columbia (DC) on federal property without having to register as businesses in DC.

Currently, entities that are formed outside of DC, including nonprofit organizations, must generally register with DC before doing business in DC. Under the bill, outside nonprofit organizations may meet with&#160;federal government officials at federally leased or owned buildings in DC without having to register.
