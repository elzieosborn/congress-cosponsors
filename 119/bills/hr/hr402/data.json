The measures generally include suspensions or delays of debt sales and suspensions or redemptions of investments in certain government funds.\n\nThe bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to appear before the committees to provide a detailed explanation of (1) the extraordinary measures that Treasury will take and the administrative costs of taking the measures, and (2) any reversal of such measures and any other changes in the funding of federal government obligations."
