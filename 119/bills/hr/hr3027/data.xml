This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish free counseling services to the next of kin and former volunteer caregivers of veterans who die by suicide. (Generally, Green Star families are families of servicemembers and veterans who have died by suicide.)

The VA may provide counseling services under this bill only if the services are reasonably accessible to the eligible individuals and are substantially equivalent or superior to similar services furnished by the VA to such individuals.

The VA is authorized to enter into an agreement with a federal, state, or private entity to provide the counseling services.

Additionally, the VA must publish information relating to the program online and provide information relating to the program to any eligible individual.</summary>
