This bill extends the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program to include Guam. (SSI&#160;is a federal assistance program designed to help aged, blind, and disabled individuals with limited income and resources meet their basic needs. Guam has been excluded from SSI since Congress created the program in 1972.)

Under the bill, the Social Security Administration may waive or modify statutory requirements relating to the provision of SSI benefits as necessary to adapt the program to the needs of Guam.

The bill also eliminates an existing cap on payments to Guam under SSI, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and other assistance programs.</summary>
