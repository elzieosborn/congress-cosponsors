The bill provides that if an educational institution cannot provide the required personalized form to an individual prior to enrollment, the institution must provide notice that specifies which information in the form may be inaccurate or incomplete and the best estimate available for such information.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to establish and regularly update a website to serve as a central location for information about training for school certifying officials regarding VA educational benefits."
