  <summary date="2025-04-02T13:06:27Z" status="Introduced in House">Open RAN Outreach Act

This bill requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to conduct outreach and provide technical assistance to small communications network providers regarding the benefits, uses, and challenges of Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) standards and other open network architectures. (Open RAN is a nonproprietary, standardized network deployment approach that promotes open networks with interoperable equipment and virtualized network operations.)

The NTIA must also conduct outreach and provide assistance to small providers regarding participation in the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund,&#160;a competitive grant program that funds efforts to accelerate the development, deployment, and adoption of Open RAN.</summary>
