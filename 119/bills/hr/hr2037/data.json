(Open RAN is a nonproprietary, standardized network deployment approach that promotes open networks with interoperable equipment and virtualized network operations.)\n\nThe NTIA must also conduct outreach and provide assistance to small providers regarding participation in the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund,\u00a0a competitive grant program that funds efforts to accelerate the development, deployment, and adoption of Open RAN."
