This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to continue FAA Academy operations in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, including air traffic controller training, during a lapse in FAA appropriations that results in a government shutdown or an emergency furlough.

If such a lapse in FAA appropriations occurs, the bill also exempts from furlough (1) all FAA employees providing services at the academy, and (2) students who are completing training at the academy and are FAA employees. This exemption requires the employees to continue working during a government shutdown.&#160;</summary>
