    "text": "Cape Fox Land Entitlement Finalization Act of 2025\n\nThis bill waives a statutory core township selection requirement for the Cape Fox Corporation and allows Cape Fox to receive\u00a0other lands to fulfill its remaining land entitlement. Cape Fox is an Alaska Native village corporation for the Alaska Native village of Saxman, Alaska.\n\nSpecifically, the bill states that Cape Fox shall not be required to receive its previously selected land of approximately 185 acres located within the township in which the Alaska Native village of Saxman, Alaska, is located. Instead, the bill allows Cape Fox to receive\u00a0land outside of Cape Fox's current exterior selection boundary upon written notice of the new selection to the Department of the Interior.\u00a0\n\nIn particular, if Cape Fox submits written notice of its selection of approximately\u00a0180 acres of surface land within the\u00a0Tongass National Forest in Alaska to Interior within 90 days of the bill's enactment, then Interior must convey the federal land to Cape Fox. Upon conveyance of the surface estate of the federal land to Cape Fox, Interior must convey the subsurface estate of the federal land to Sealaska Corporation (the Alaska Native regional corporation representing southeastern Alaska).\n\nThe bill reserves a public access easement on the federal land conveyed to Cape Fox and Sealaska."
