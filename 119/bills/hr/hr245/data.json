Upon determination by the granting agency that a grantee is in violation of this bill, the agency must withhold any federal grant funds from the grantee.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) must report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) individuals convicted of, or who admitted to, such a violation. Additionally, the DOJ must report to OMB if DOJ believes there is a reasonable basis to conclude that an individual has committed such a violation."
