The funds may be used for any disaster relief, emergency assistance, and recovery program authorized under the Robert\u00a0T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, including individual assistance, public assistance, and other disbursements and obligations\u00a0for\u00a0programs or activities necessary to protect life and property during a lapse in appropriations.\n\nThe bill also requires employees who are necessary to carry out these disbursements or related program activities to be treated as excepted employees under the Anti-Deficiency Act. (Excepted employees are required to work during a lapse in appropriations.) The bill also prohibits these employees from being subject to a furlough or a reduction in force due to a lapse in appropriations.\u00a0"
