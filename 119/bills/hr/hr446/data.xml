This bill increases the excise tax on the net investment income of certain private university and college endowments.&#160;

Under current law, certain private&#160;universities and colleges with 500 or more tuition-paying students (of which more than 50%&#160;are located in the United States) and endowments that are at least $500,000 per student pay an excise tax in the amount of 1.4% on the net investment income from such endowments.

The bill increases the amount of the excise tax to 21% of the net investment income from such university and college endowments.&#160;

Further, the bill provides that amounts collected from the increase to the&#160;excise tax on the net investment income from such university and college endowments are (1) to be deposited into the general fund of the&#160;Treasury; and (2) used to reduce the national deficit and, subsequently, the national debt.&#160;</summary>
