This bill prohibits the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development from obligating or expending federal funds for bilateral, multilateral, or humanitarian non-defense foreign assistance within the first 60 days following a presidentially declared major disaster. The prohibition may be waived if a joint resolution of Congress providing for such a waiver is enacted into law.&#160;</summary>
