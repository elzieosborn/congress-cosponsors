  <summary date="2025-07-22T10:16:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Expediting Federal Broadband Deployment Reviews Act

This bill establishes an interagency strike force to support federal land management agencies' review of requests for communications use authorizations. (A communications use authorization is required to modify or locate communications facilities on public lands.)

The strike force must (1) conduct periodic calls with strike force members to ensure that each agency prioritizes the review of requests for communications use authorizations, (2) establish goals for the review of the requests, and (3) monitor and facilitate agency accountability for meeting the established goals.

The bill specifies that the strike force must include the head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the head of each federal land management agency, and other members designated by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior. The bill also requires the strike force to report to Congress regarding its effectiveness.</summary>
