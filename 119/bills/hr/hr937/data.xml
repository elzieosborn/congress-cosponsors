This bill limits the authority of the Department of Education (ED) to propose or issue regulations and executive actions related to federal student aid programs.

Economically significant refers to a regulation or executive action that is likely to (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or (2) adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities.</summary>
