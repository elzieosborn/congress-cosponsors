    "text": "Farm and Food Cybersecurity Act of 2025\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to (1) assess\u00a0cybersecurity threats in the agriculture and food\u00a0critical infrastructure\u00a0sector, and (2) conduct annual crisis simulation exercises for food-related emergencies or disruptions. The agriculture and food\u00a0critical infrastructure\u00a0sector\u00a0includes (1) any activity relating to the production, processing,\u00a0distribution, storage, transportation, consumption, or disposal of agricultural or food products; and (2) any entity involved in any of these activities.\n\nSpecifically, USDA must conduct a risk assessment every two years on the\u00a0cybersecurity threats to, and security vulnerabilities in, this sector. The risk assessment must include any recommendations for federal legislative or administrative actions to address related threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nUSDA must also conduct an annual simulation exercise relating to a food-related emergency or disruption in coordination with\u00a0the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).\n\nAmong other things, the exercise must (1) involve a realistic and plausible scenario that simulates a food-related emergency or disruption that affects multiple sectors and jurisdictions, and (2) incorporate input from experts and stakeholders from various disciplines and sectors (e.g., agriculture, public health, emergency management, transportation, and energy).\u00a0\n\nUSDA, in consultation with DHS, HHS, and ODNI, must submit a report to Congress on each simulation exercise, including recommendations to enhance the\u00a0cybersecurity and resilience of the agriculture and food critical infrastructure sector."
