    "text": "Federal Employee Performance and Accountability Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes a pilot program making pay increases for certain federal employees contingent on job performance.\n\nUnder the bill, each executive agency must identify\u00a0employees to participate in the five-year pilot program from among employees classified at or above the GS-11 level and holding positions with clearly measurable performance criteria. Each agency must select 1%-10% of these\u00a0employees to participate in the program. An agency may opt out if participation potentially risks national security or public safety.\n\nThe bill provides that a participating agency\n\nmust\u00a0increase an employee's pay by up to 10%\u00a0if the\u00a0employee significantly exceeded established performance metrics during the preceding year,\u00a0 may not increase the pay of an employee who met established performance metrics during the preceding year, and\u00a0must reduce by 10%\u00a0the pay of an employee who rates below expectations for the preceding year.Participating employees are ineligible for annual or locality-based pay increases authorized under current law during the pilot.\n\nThe\u00a0bill also requires\u00a0agencies to establish performance plans and evaluation systems for participating employees. Agencies must also provide training and resources to help participating\u00a0employees understand and meet\u00a0performance requirements.\n\nParticipating agencies must report cost savings, productivity metrics, and other information to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) every year. OMB and the Government Accountability Office must jointly report on the final outcome of the program.\n\n\u00a0"
