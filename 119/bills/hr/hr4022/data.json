(Currently, states may receive payment for such services through certain mechanisms, such as through a Medicaid demonstration waiver.)\n\nThe bill also requires state Medicaid programs that cover IMD services to improve patient access to outpatient and community-based behavioral health care, expand crisis stabilization services, facilitate care coordination between providers and first responders, and report specified information relating to IMD utilization and costs."
