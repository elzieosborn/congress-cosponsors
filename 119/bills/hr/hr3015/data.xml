This bill provides statutory authority for the National Coal Council and directs the Department of Energy to reestablish the council&#160;in accordance with the charter that was in effect on November 19, 2021. Established in 1984, the council made recommendations to DOE on matters relating to coal and the coal industry.

In addition, the bill removes the requirement under the Federal Advisory Committee Act for the council to be re-chartered every two years.</summary>
