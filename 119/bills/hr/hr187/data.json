The standards must ensure compatibility and interoperability among applicable federal databases with respect to collection and dissemination of such data.\n\nWithin five years, the Forest Service and Interior must also digitize and make publicly available online certain geographic information system data about (1) federal waterway restrictions, (2) federal waterway access and navigation information, and (3) federal fishing restrictions. They must also update the data about waterway restrictions, waterway access, and navigation information at least twice per year. Data about fishing restrictions must be updated in real time as changes go into effect.\n\nFinally, the\u00a0Forest Service and Interior\u00a0must develop a process to allow members of the public to submit questions or comments regarding the data regarding waterway restrictions,\u00a0waterway access, and navigation information."
