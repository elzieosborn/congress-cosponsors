    "text": "This bill prohibits the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from implementing, administering, or enforcing its 2024 Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment for its Buffalo Field Office in Wyoming. The field office manages 780,291 acres of public lands and 4,731,140 acres of mineral estates within Campbell, Johnson, and Sheridan Counties in north-central Wyoming.\n\nIn 2015, the\u00a0BLM published a management plan for the field office that allowed leases of certain public lands or mineral estates\u00a0within the office's planning area for the development of coal.\u00a0\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana in\u00a0Western Organization of Resource Councils v. Bureau of Land Management\u00a0ordered the BLM to complete a new environmental impact statement\u00a0(EIS) for the management plan under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires an agency to include all reasonable alternatives to its action and the environmental impacts resulting from the action. Specifically, the court ordered the\u00a0BLM to issue an EIS that considers an alternative of not leasing coal under the management plan as well as an alternative that limits the amount of coal potentially available for leasing.\n\nIn response to the court order, the BLM published an amendment to the plan on November 27, 2024. The amended plan made no acres within the office's planning area available for future coal leasing in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, it allowed existing coal leases to be developed."
