Specifically, the President may take these actions if it is determined that the country (1) when importing a good from the United States, applies a higher rate of duty on that good than the rate imposed by the United States when the good is imported from that country; or (2) similarly imposes other,\u00a0nontariff trade restrictions on that good. This authority\u00a0shall be effective for three years, subject to a three-year renewal.\n\nThe President must terminate a rate of duty increase under this bill if the country no longer applies such higher rates or nontariff trade restrictions, or if the higher rate is no longer in the interest of the United States.\n\nThe bill also requires the President to consult with and notify Congress regarding the intention of the President to increase a rate of duty on imported goods.\n\nCongress may nullify a rate of duty increase implemented under this bill through a joint resolution of disapproval."
