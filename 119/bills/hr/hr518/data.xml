This bill withholds the pay of Members of Congress if active service members of the Armed Forces are not receiving pay, including as a result of a lapse in appropriations (i.e., a government shutdown). The withheld pay of Members must be deposited into an escrow account and released when the military lapse in pay ends.</summary>
