  <summary date="2025-05-09T17:35:48Z" status="Introduced in House">State-Level Departments of Government Efficiency Establishment Act or the State-Level&#160;DOGE Establishment Act

This bill requires states that receive certain federal funds to establish and maintain a government efficiency department, agency, or commission.

Specifically, the bill prohibits certain discretionary appropriations from being disbursed to any state that has not established and maintained a government efficiency department, agency, or commission to review the efficacy of the state&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s administration of federal funding and to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer funds.

This requirement does not apply to discretionary appropriations within the security category, which includes appropriations associated with the budgets&#160;for the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the intelligence community management account, and international affairs.&#160;

The bill also requires a state government efficiency entity established under this bill to submit to the Department of Government Efficiency within the Executive Office of the President an annual report that (1) details the entity&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s work, and (2) provides legislative and operational suggestions and recommendations to improve the efficiency of expenditures of federal funds. The report must also be published on the state's public website.&#160;</summary>
