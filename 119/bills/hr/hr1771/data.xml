This bill requires the President's annual budget to include specified information regarding improper payment amounts and rates for programs and activities at certain federal agencies. (An improper payment&#160;is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including an overpayment or underpayment, under a statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirement.)

Specifically, the President's budget must include (1) a narrative description, including a detailed explanation of why any improper payment amounts and&#160;rates occurred and related trends for programs and activities; and (2) corrective actions and steps the agencies will take to address improper payment amount and rate issues.&#160;</summary>
