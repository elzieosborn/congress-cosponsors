  <summary date="2025-08-13T12:37:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Safe American Food Exports Act of&#160;2025 or the SAFE Act of 2025

This bill provides statutory authority for the Department of Agriculture to negotiate in advance for regional export ban agreements&#160;for known animal disease threats that apply only to areas affected by animal disease outbreaks to enable the continuation of exports from areas not affected by an outbreak.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Foreign Agricultural Service, in consultation with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, may negotiate the regionalization, zoning, compartmentalization, and other agreements regarding outbreaks of known animal disease threats of trade significance with countries with export markets for livestock animals or animal products from the United States.

The bill also specifies that such a negotiation should seek to take into account accepted global research advances.</summary>
