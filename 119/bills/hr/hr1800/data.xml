  <summary date="2025-05-02T19:53:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Solidify Iran Sanctions Act of 2025

This bill eliminates a sunset clause in the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, thereby making the act permanent.

The Iran Sanctions Act requires the President, with some exceptions, to impose sanctions on certain individuals or entities engaged in specified transactions related to Iran's energy sector or Iran's efforts to acquire or develop certain weapons (such as chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons).</summary>
