This trust fund may only be used for five specified purposes, including for activities related to water production, treatment, or delivery infrastructure.\n\nThe bill also (1) specifies the water rights of the pueblo; and (2) outlines waivers, releases, and retentions of claims by the pueblo and the United States."
