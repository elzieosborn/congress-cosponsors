It also requires HHS to conduct a study and report to Congress on traumatic brain injuries.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grants to states for traumatic brain injury surveillance and registries (renaming the program after the late Representative&#160;Bill Pascrell, Jr.),&#160;CDC research and public awareness activities to reduce traumatic brain injuries,Administration for Community Living (ACL) grants to states and American Indian consortiums for services and support for individuals living with traumatic brain injuries, andACL grants for protection and advocacy agencies supporting individuals with traumatic brain injuries.Also, the bill generally expands the scope and requirements of these programs, including by requiring the CDC to publish information on populations at higher risk for traumatic brain injuries and strategies for preventing such injuries in these populations.&#160;

Additionally, HHS must conduct a study on long-term symptoms or conditions in people who experience traumatic brain injuries and report the findings to Congress. HHS must also submit a report to Congress on populations with a higher risk of traumatic brain injuries and outreach efforts for such populations.</summary>
