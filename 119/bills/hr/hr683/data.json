Specifically, the program is for those who served on active duty in a theater of combat operations during a period of war after the Persian Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force during a period of hostilities after November 11, 1998.\n\nThe VA must, in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Homeland Security, establish a mechanism to permit a member of the Armed Forces to elect to pre-enroll in the VA health care system during the 180-day period preceding the date of separation of the member from active service.\n\nThe VA-DOD Joint Executive Committee must brief Congress on the efforts to implement such a mechanism under the program.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the program and include recommendations with respect to methods to improve the program."
