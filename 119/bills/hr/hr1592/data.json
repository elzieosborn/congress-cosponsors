    "text": "Securing Our Lands and Resources Act or the SOLAR Act\n\nThis bill prohibits the Department of Agriculture from providing financial assistance for certain projects that would result in the conversion of covered farmland for solar energy production.\n\nUnder the bill, covered farmland generally refers to prime farmland, unique farmland, and farmland that is of statewide or local importance. Conversion means any activity that results in the covered farmland no longer meeting certain requirements for agricultural production, activity, or use.\n\nThe bill includes an exception for certain smaller projects that\u00a0result in\u00a0the conversion of (1) less than 5 acres of covered farmland, or (2)\u00a0less than 50 acres of covered farmland if the majority of the energy produced by the project is for on-farm use.\n\nThe bill also includes an exception for projects that have the approval or support from the local county and municipality. For these projects, the applicant must (1) develop a farmland conservation plan for the project (e.g., implementing best practices to protect future soil health and productivity), and (2) ensure that sufficient funds are provided for the decommissioning of the solar energy production system and the remediation and restoration of the farmland."
