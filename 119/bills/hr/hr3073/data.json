    "text": "Shivwits Band of Paiutes Jurisdictional Clarity Act\n\nThis bill confers legal jurisdiction to the State of Utah over certain civil cases involving the Shivwits Band of Paiutes. It also allows the tribe to lease its land held in trust. The tribe is located in southwestern Utah.\n\nSpecifically, the bill confers jurisdiction to the State of Utah\u00a0over any civil cause of action (1) to which the\u00a0Shivwits Band of Paiutes is a party, and (2) that arises on or within Indian lands. Under the bill, Indian lands are lands of the tribe that are (1) held in trust for the benefit of the tribe, or (2) subject to restrictions by the United States against alienation (i.e., sale or transfer).\n\nAdditionally, the bill specifies that any cause of action arising from any contract or agreement (including a lease) to which the tribe is party or that affects or arises on these Indian lands shall be deemed a civil cause of action. Therefore, this bill allows the tribe and third parties to resolve contract disputes in state court.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the tribe to lease its land held in trust for a term of up to 99 years."
