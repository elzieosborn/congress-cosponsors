This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a five-year pilot program to give preference to any procurement action or solicitation with a non-public partner that uses a government-owned and operated arsenal of the Department of the Army in any type of contractual agreement with the government. Under the program, DOD must add 20% to the price of the bid of non-public partners that do not use a government-owned arsenal.

DOD must also give preference to non-public partners that utilize the Advanced Manufacturing Center of Excellence of the Army and ensure not less than 25% of the activities under the partnership are performed by DOD employees.</summary>
