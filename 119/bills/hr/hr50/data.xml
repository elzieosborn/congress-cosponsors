This bill prohibits the use of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to assist non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who are not lawfully admitted permanent residents. The CDBG program is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and provides states, local governments, and Indian tribes with funds for economic and community development.

The bill also specifically prohibits HUD from making a CDBG grant to any state, local government, or Indian tribe that carries out a housing or community development program that assists such individuals.&#160;</summary>
