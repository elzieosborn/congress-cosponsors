    "text": "End Unaccountable Amnesty Act\n\nThis bill revises, restricts, and repeals various laws and programs addressing the admissibility and deportability of certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law). The bill includes changes to the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, the treatment of unaccompanied children, and removal proceedings.\n\nUnder current law, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may grant a foreign state Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which protects qualified nationals of that foreign state from removal from the United States. The bill instead requires an act of Congress to grant TPS to a foreign state. The bill limits TPS status to 12 months, subject to extension.\n\nThe bill also generally requires the return of unaccompanied inadmissible children to their country of nationality or last habitual residence, among other changes. Under current law,\u00a0DHS is authorized (not required) to return these children, and only if their country of nationality or last habitual residence is contiguous to the United States.\n\nThe bill also repeals the law allowing for the cancellation of removal or adjustment of the immigration status of qualifying\u00a0non-U.S. nationals.\u00a0\n\nUnder the bill, certain forms of identification, including a Notice to Appear issued by\u00a0DHS, are no longer valid documents for purposes of airport security checkpoints.\n\nThe bill also limits the ability of\u00a0DHS to grant parole (temporary admission granted on a case-by-case basis). For example, the bill limits the granting of parole to a list of specific situations, such as the imminent death of a close family member."
