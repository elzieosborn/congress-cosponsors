    "text": "Anti-Congestion Tax Act \n\nThis bill prohibits the Department of Transportation (DOT) from awarding capital investment grants to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) for projects in New York until DOT certifies that vehicles using certain crossings to enter into Manhattan's congestion tolling zone\u00a0receive exemptions from congestion tolls.\u00a0The vehicular crossings include the Holland Tunnel, the Lincoln Tunnel, the George Washington Bridge,\u00a0and any other crossing immediately before entry into the congestion tolling zone.\n\nAs background, the\u00a0MTA's Central Business District Tolling Program for New York City charges drivers a toll to enter an area in Manhattan designated as the Congestion Relief Zone.\u00a0Under the bill, congestion tolling zone generally means any roadways, bridges, tunnels, approaches, or ramps that are located within, or enter to, the Congestion Relief Zone, with some modifications.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the MTA to credit a vehicle for the vehicular crossing toll from the amount of the congestion toll charged to the vehicle for entering the congestion tolling zone.\n\nFurther,\u00a0the bill allows drivers entering Manhattan using any of the vehicular\u00a0crossings immediately before entry into the congestion tolling zone\u00a0to receive a federal tax credit at the end of the year equal to the amount paid in congestion tolls for using the crossing.\u00a0"
