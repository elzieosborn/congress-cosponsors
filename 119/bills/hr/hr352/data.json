The New York program charges drivers a toll to enter an area in Manhattan designated as the Congestion Relief Zone.\n\n In general, cordon pricing is a form of congestion pricing that includes a zone-based pricing system that involves either variable or fixed charges to drive within or into a congested area within a city."
