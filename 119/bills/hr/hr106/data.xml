This bill modifies the process for removing a species from the endangered or threatened species lists and makes related requirements.&#160;

A species must be removed from the endangered or threatened species lists if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service produces or receives substantial scientific or commercial information demonstrating that the species is recovered or that recovery goals set for the species have been met.

The publication and notice of a proposed regulation to remove a species from the lists must consist solely of a notice of the removal.

The bill establishes a process for removing species from the lists if they were erroneously or wrongfully listed. The bill prohibits a person from submitting a petition to list a species as a threatened or endangered species for 10 years if the person knowingly submitted a petition with information that was inaccurate beyond scientifically reasonable margins of error, fraudulent, or misrepresentative.</summary>
