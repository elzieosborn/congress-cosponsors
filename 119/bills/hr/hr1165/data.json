    "text": "Port Crane Security and Inspection Act of 2025 \n\nThis bill limits the operation of foreign cranes at U.S. ports. In general,\u00a0foreign cranes are those that\u00a0have information technology and operational technology components that (1) were manufactured by companies that are subject to the ownership, control, or influence of a country designated as a foreign adversary; and (2) connect to ports' cyber infrastructure.\n\nForeign cranes that are contracted for on or after the date of the bill's enactment may not operate at a U.S. port. Also, beginning five years after this bill is enacted, foreign cranes operating at U.S. ports may not use software or other technology manufactured by a company owned by a country designated as a foreign adversary.\n\nAdditionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) must (1) inspect foreign cranes\u00a0for potential security risks or threats before they are placed into operation, (2) assess the threat posed by security risks or threats of existing or newly constructed foreign cranes, and (3) take any crane that poses a security risk or threat offline until the crane can be certified as no longer being a risk or threat.\n\nCISA must also report to Congress about security risks or threats posed by foreign cranes at U.S. ports."
