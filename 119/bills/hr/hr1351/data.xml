This bill requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish, maintain, and enforce policies that require federally funded public elementary and secondary schools to display the U.S. flag, educate students about the U.S. flag, and&#160;direct students and staff to recite the Pledge of Allegiance on a daily basis.

Specifically, LEAs, as a condition of receiving federal elementary and secondary education funds, must require the following activities at each school:

for all students, teachers, and staff to recite the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of each school day (with an exception for religious or personal reasons);for the U.S. flag to be prominently displayed in each classroom and gymnasium; andfor educational materials on the history, significance, and proper display of the U.S. flag to be incorporated into the civics or history curriculum of each grade level.The bill includes annual certification requirements. Further, the bill authorizes and directs the Department of Education to issue and secure compliance with rules or orders with respect to an LEA that fails to certify (or certifies in bad faith) compliance with the bill's requirements.</summary>
