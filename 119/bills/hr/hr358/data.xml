This bill lengthens the limitations on former Congress Members'&#160;contact with the legislative branch&#160;and restricts certain financial transactions by&#160;Members&#160;and their spouses.

Specifically, the bill lengthens the cooling off period that prohibits former Members from contacting Members, officers, or employees of the House or Senate on behalf of a third party. During this post-employment waiting period, a former Member may not communicate with the intent to influence the official actions of a Member, officer, or employee of the House of Representatives or Senate. The bill lengthens the waiting period from one to three years after a Member of the House leaves&#160;office and from two to six years after a Senator leaves office.

Next, the bill prohibits Members of Congress and their spouses from&#160;holding, buying, or selling financial instruments such as stocks, securities futures, and commodities while the Member holds office. However, covered financial instruments may be held in a qualified blind trust. A Member or spouse who violates this provision must disgorge any resulting profits, may not take a related financial loss as an income tax deduction, and may be fined&#160;up to&#160;$50,000. The supervising ethics office of each chamber must audit Members' compliance with these&#160;requirements every two years.&#160;

Additionally, the bill eliminates automatic annual increases to Members' pay beginning in the 120th Congress.</summary>
