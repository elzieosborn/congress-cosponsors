This bill establishes deadlines for states to count ballots and certify results in federal elections.&#160;

Specifically, the bill requires a state to finish counting the ballots cast in a federal election held in the state not later than 10:00 p.m. on the date of the election. Further, the state must certify the election results not later than 48 hours after the election.&#160;

The bill provides exceptions to these deadlines for bona fide emergencies (e.g., major disasters) or technical difficulties (e.g., malfunctioning election equipment or software).</summary>
