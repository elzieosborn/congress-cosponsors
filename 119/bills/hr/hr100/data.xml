This bill expands the list of preliminary requirements that must be satisfied before a class action lawsuit may be brought in federal court.

Specifically, before a party may bring a class action lawsuit in federal court, the court must first determine that a new, fifth requirement has been met: that the claim does not allege misclassification of employees as independent contractors.</summary>
