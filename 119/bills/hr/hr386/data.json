    "text": "Chinese Currency Accountability Act of 2025\n\nThis bill requires the United States to oppose, absent specified conditions, any increase in the weight of Chinese currency (i.e., the renminbi) in the basket of currencies (currently, a set of five currencies, each with different weightings) used to determine the value of Special Drawing Rights. Special Drawing Rights are international reserve assets created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to supplement member countries' official foreign exchange reserves.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of the Treasury must instruct certain U.S. officials at the IMF to oppose any such increase unless Treasury has certified that China is in compliance with certain standards and international agreements, including that (1) China is in compliance with all general obligations of members of the IMF, (2) China has not been found to have manipulated its currency in the preceding 12 months, and (3) China\u00a0adheres to the rules and principles of the Paris Club and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits.\u00a0"
