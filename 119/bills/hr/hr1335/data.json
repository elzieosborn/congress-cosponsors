    "text": "Measures for Safer School Districts Act or the\u00a0MSD Act\n\nThis bill requires each local educational agency (LEA), as a condition of receiving federal elementary and secondary education funds, to establish procedures for responding to school emergencies and for timely notifying parents of school emergencies. It also requires interior and exterior doors in schools to be reinforced.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires each LEA to (1) develop and implement emergency response procedures covering all students, faculty, and staff at public schools under the jurisdiction of the LEA; and (2) ensure that parents and guardians receive timely notification of covered threats and emergencies (e.g., active shooter situations, bomb threats, and natural disasters) that occur on school grounds, during school transportation, or during school-sponsored activities. These emergency response procedures must meet specified criteria, including by requiring\u00a0commonly used alarm system responses for specific types of emergencies.\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires the\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to convene a rulemaking advisory committee to review and develop findings and recommendations to require the installation or modification of interior and exterior doors in any school that receives federal funding. Further,\u00a0CISA must (1) submit a report to Congress on the advisory committee's findings and recommendations, and (2) issue a final rule that requires the installation or modification of interior and exterior doors in schools to reinforce such doors.\n\nThe bill authorizes the use of grants under the Homeland Security Grant Program to carry out the bill's provisions."
