This bill modifies the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&amp;E) program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VR&amp;E program provides job training and employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities.

The bill requires veterans to submit an application to the VA in order to receive an initial evaluation to participate in the VR&amp;E program.

Further, a veteran may not receive employment assistance under the VR&amp;E program for more than 365 days.

The bill also requires the VA to report to Congress regarding the employment of veterans who participate in a vocational rehabilitation program under the VR&amp;E program, including the annual wages of veterans before and after completion of a program. Additionally, the VA must annually publish the average time between the date on which a veteran requests a vocational rehabilitation program under the VR&amp;E program and the date on which they first meet with a counselor as part of the program.

Finally, the VA must seek to enter into a contract with a non-VA entity that has expertise in vocational rehabilitation to review, report, and provide recommendations on rehabilitation programs under the VR&amp;E program.</summary>
