    "text": "Proven Forest Management Act of 2025\n\nThis bill sets forth provisions to expedite the approval and implementation of forest management activities and establishes related requirements.\n\nFirst, the bill categorically excludes a forest management activity conducted on National Forest System land\u00a0for reducing forest fuels from certain environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 if the activity (1) does not exceed 10,000 acres (including not more than 3,000 acres of mechanical thinning), (2) is developed in a collaborative manner, and (3) is consistent with the forest plan developed for the relevant National Forest System land.\n\nNext, the bill directs the Forest Service to conduct\u00a0forest management activities in a manner that attains multiple ecosystem benefits unless the costs associated with attaining such benefits are excessive.\n\nAdditionally, the Forest Service must (1) establish any post-program ground condition criteria for a ground disturbance caused by a forest management activity required by the applicable forest plan, and (2) provide for monitoring to ascertain the attainment of relevant post-program conditions.\n\nThe bill also allows the Forest Service or the Department of the Interior, as appropriate, to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with certain entities to provide for fuel reduction, erosion control, reforestation, and similar activities on federal and nonfederal lands within land adjustment programs.\n\nFinally, the bill directs the Forest Service, when conducting a forest management activity on National Forest System land, to coordinate with impacted parties to increase efficiency and maximize the compatibility of management practices across such land."
