    "text": "Revoke Exemptions for Venezuelan Oil to Curb Autocratic Repression Act of 2025 or the REVOCAR Act of 2025\n\nThis bill prohibits U.S. investment in Venezuela's energy sector.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits any transaction\u00a0by a U.S. person (individual or entity) to invest, trade, or operate within Venezuela's energy\u00a0sector and any transaction that attempts to evade such prohibition. This prohibition includes the provision of goods, services, or finance to (1) Venezuela's state-owned oil and natural gas company (Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A.), its subsidiaries, representatives, or related companies; or (2) the regime of Nicolas Maduro or any nondemocratic successor government in Venezuela.\u00a0\n\nThe prohibitions of this bill terminate on the earlier of December 31, 2027, or the date the President submits a determination to Congress that the Maduro regime has recognized the July 28, 2024, electoral victory of Edmundo Gonzalez and relinquished power to the democratically elected government.\n\nThe President may waive these prohibitions on a case-by-case basis for not more than 90 days after determining such a waiver is vital to U.S. national security interests and submitting a report to Congress. Such waivers may be renewed."
