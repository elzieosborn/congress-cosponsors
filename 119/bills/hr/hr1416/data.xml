This bill requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to provide additional notification to, and receive written consent from, parents of students regarding certain school activities that relate to students' privacy.&#160;

Under current law, an LEA must annually notify parents of the specific or approximate dates during the school year when specified activities involving information collection, surveys, and screenings are scheduled or expected to be scheduled.

In addition to this required notification, the bill requires an LEA to directly notify a student's parent 14 days before the scheduled activity and receive written consent from the parent in order for the student to participate in the activity.</summary>
