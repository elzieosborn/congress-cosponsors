This bill requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to provide certain fair-value estimates of federal loan and loan guarantee programs. Under the bill, the fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair-value estimates generally use private-market interest rates to estimate the cost of a loan program rather than rates based on Treasury securities.

The bill requires CBO to include fair-value estimates in (1) any estimate prepared for a measure that establishes or modifies a loan or loan guarantee program, and (2) its publication titled The Budget and Economic Outlook. If CBO provides a fair-value estimate pursuant to this bill, the chairs of the congressional budget committees must use the estimate to determine compliance with budget enforcement requirements.&#160;&#160;

The bill also requires the Office of Management and Budget to submit an annual report to Congress on fair-value estimates of the costs of federal credit programs.&#160;&#160;</summary>
