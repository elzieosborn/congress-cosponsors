  <summary date="2025-03-20T13:58:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Accelerating Networking, Cyberinfrastructure, and Hardware for Oceanic Research Act or the ANCHOR Act&#160;

This bill requires the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a plan to improve the cybersecurity and telecommunications capabilities of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF).

ARF is comprised of U.S.-flagged vessels that provide at-sea laboratories where oceanographic scientists, educators, and students research and learn about marine science.&#160;

The bill requires the plan to include assessments of

telecommunications and networking needs of ARF, consistent with typical scientific missions;cybersecurity needs appropriate for the operation of ARF vessels and their specific research functions;the costs necessary to meet these needs;the time required to implement necessary upgrades; andopportunities for the adoption of common solutions or&#160;consortial licensing agreements, or for the centralization of cybersecurity, telecommunications, or data management at a single facility.&#160;The plan must also include a spending plan for the NSF, the Office of Naval Research, nonfederal&#160;owners of ARF vessels,&#160;and users of the vessels to cover identified costs.&#160;

Among other factors specified in the bill, the&#160;NSF must consider, as appropriate, the network capabilities necessary to meet mission needs (e.g., to upload data to cloud-based or shoreside servers), international standards and guidance for information security, and requirements for controlled unclassified or classified information.&#160;

The plan must be provided to Congress within 18 months of the bill's enactment, and the NSF must later report to Congress on the plan's implementation.&#160;</summary>
