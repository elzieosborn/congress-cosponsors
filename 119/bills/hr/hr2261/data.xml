This bill increases privacy protections associated with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intelligence information.&#160;

Specifically, the bill requires designated DHS officials to ensure that certain intelligence information is shared, stored, and disseminated in a manner consistent with the protection of civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy rights.

The bill also provides statutory authority for requirements for DHS to train intelligence personnel on civil rights, civil liberties, privacy rights, and privacy-related regulations and information practices. Such training must focus on those who disseminate information analyzed by DHS or who review such information for dissemination.</summary>
