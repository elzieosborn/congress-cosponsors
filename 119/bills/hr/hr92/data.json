    "text": "Strategic Production Response and Implementation Act\n\nThis bill modifies the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prohibit\u00a0the Department of Energy (DOE) from drawing down petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until DOE develops and implements a plan to increase the percentage of federal lands leased for oil and gas production. The increase must be equal to\u00a0the percentage of petroleum in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is to be drawn down. However, the bill does not apply to a drawdown of\u00a0petroleum products in the case of a severe energy supply interruption, which is permitted under current law.\u00a0\n\nThe plan must not provide for a total increase in the percentage of federal lands leased for oil and gas production in excess of 10%."
