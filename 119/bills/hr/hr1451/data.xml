  <summary date="2025-06-27T15:59:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Quapaw Tribal Settlement Act of 2025

This bill creates a trust account, funds the account,&#160;and establishes a distribution process to settle certain claims between the federal government and the&#160;Quapaw Nation (a tribe in Oklahoma).&#160;

Specifically, the bill establishes&#160;the&#160;Quapaw Bear Settlement Trust Account and directs the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Trust Funds Administration to administer all funds appropriated to the trust account.&#160;

Interior must make payments to the tribe and individual members of the tribe in accordance with the January 2020 recommendation of the review panel of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

The bill outlines the distribution process for the settlement funds in the trust account.</summary>
