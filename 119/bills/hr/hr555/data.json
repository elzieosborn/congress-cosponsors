    "text": "Veterans Affairs Transfer of Information and Sharing of Disability Examination Procedures With DOD Doctors Act\n\nThis bill addresses the sharing of medical information and disability examination procedures between the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA). It requires that if a member of the Armed Forces who is required to receive a physical examination upon separation from active duty has or is believed to have a medical condition that may make the member eligible for veterans' disability compensation and benefits, the examination must be performed by a VA-certified health care provider.\n\nIf the condition is discovered during the physical examination and the examining health care provider is not VA-certified, the examination must be completed by a VA-certified provider.\n\nAn eligibility determination made as part of such an examination shall be binding on the VA and be used as the basis for assigning the member's disability rating.\n\nThe VA and DOD shall jointly establish a system to share data and maintain the medical and personnel records of Armed Forces members and veterans."
