    "text": "Healthy Poultry Assistance and Indemnification Act\u00a0of 2025\n\nThis bill expands the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) producer indemnity and compensation program to include compensation for all poultry growers and layers located in an APHIS-determined control area, which may include non-infected poultry.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, APHIS provides indemnity and compensation to producers to remove animals classified as affected, suspect, or exposed to diseases of concern, including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). An APHIS-determined\u00a0control area consists of both an infected zone and a buffer zone. \u00a0Under the bill, APHIS must compensate all owners of poultry growing or laying facilities for flocks of birds that the facility owner was prohibited from growing or laying due to the location of the facility\u00a0within a control area. This may include facilities that are located in the buffer zones and have non-infected poultry.\n\nFurther, the bill establishes a new compensation payment formula that requires payments to be based on the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average income from the five most recent flocks.\u00a0Under the bill,\u00a0APHIS's compensation determination is final and not subject to judicial or administrative review (other than by the Secretary of Agriculture or a designee)."
