  <summary date="2025-11-14T14:26:51Z" status="Reported to House">Enhancing Stakeholder Support and Outreach for Preparedness Grants Act

This bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide outreach and support to stakeholders regarding grants for protecting communities from terrorist attacks.

Specifically, FEMA must provide ongoing outreach and technical assistance to public entities and other stakeholders before, during, and after awarding grants under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative. FEMA must conduct annual surveys of public entities regarding the grants and provide information on stakeholder feedback and how it was incorporated into these programs.

The Government Accountability Office and&#160;FEMA must report to Congress on FEMA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s implementation of the bill.</summary>
