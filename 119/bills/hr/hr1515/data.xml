This bill establishes requirements concerning the posting of agency guidance documents. Specifically, an agency must publish guidance documents online on the dates they are issued, publish all of its guidance documents that are in effect in a single location on a designated website, display a hyperlink on its website that provides access to the guidance documents on such website, and indicate on such website if a guidance document has been rescinded.

The documents must be categorized as guidance documents and further divided into subcategories.

No later than five years after the enactment of this bill, the Government Accountability Office must report on agency compliance with these requirements.</summary>
