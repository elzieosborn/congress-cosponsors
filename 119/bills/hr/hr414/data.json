    "text": "Student Visa Security Improvement Act\n\nThis bill establishes new requirements for foreign student visas and participating educational institutions.\u00a0\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must review the applications of student visa applicants and conduct in-person interviews when appropriate to determine whether they are inadmissible due to terrorist-related activities. DHS must also conduct on-site reviews of applications and supporting documents deemed appropriate prior to final adjudication.\n\nInstitutions and exchange student visitor programs must ensure that student visa-holders are active participants in the program. Students must be regularly observed and must be reported on if they transfer or change majors. The bill also provides for enhanced access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System for institutions and programs that meet staffing and training requirements.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must review the fees for the Student and Exchange Visitor program."
