    "text": "Federal Infrastructure Bank Act of 2025\n\nThis bill establishes the Federal Infrastructure Bank and the Federal Infrastructure Bank Holding Company (FIBHC). The bank shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of the FIBHC.\n\nThe bank must provide equity investments, direct loans, and loan guarantees for the planning, predevelopment, design, construction, operation, or maintenance of revenue-producing infrastructure projects in the United States with sufficient revenue sources and guarantees to support the interest and principal payments to the bank. At least 10% of the loans, equity investments, and loan guarantees must be for infrastructure projects in rural areas.\n\nEntities eligible for loans, equity investments, and loan guarantees include corporations, joint ventures, states, and governmental entities. The bank is prohibited from providing funding for infrastructure projects that are owned, directed, controlled, financed, or influenced by the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall have oversight and supervisory authority over the FIBHC and the bank. The bank must establish an Infrastructure Guarantee Fund to cover loans and loan guarantees in the event of nonpayment by loan recipients.\n\nThe FIBHC may issue equity securities, make dividend payments on the securities, and issue bonds.\u00a0\n\nThe bill provides for a tax credit in an amount equal to 10% of the amount a taxpayer paid to the FIBHC for an equity investment issued within three years of\u00a0the formation of the FIBHC."
