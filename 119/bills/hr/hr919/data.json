However, an HDHP may cover certain types of preventive care without requiring a deductible or with a deductible below the minimum threshold.\u00a0\n\nThe IRS issued guidance expanding the types of preventive care that may be covered by an HDHP without requiring a deductible or with a deductible below the minimum threshold to include\n\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for individuals with congestive heart failure, diabetes, or coronary artery disease;anti-resorptive therapy for individuals with osteoporosis or\u00a0osteopenia;beta-blockers for individuals with congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease;blood pressure monitors for individuals with hypertension;inhaled\u00a0corticosteroids and peak flow meters for individuals with asthma;insulin and other glucose lowering agents, retinopathy screening,\u00a0glucometers, and hemoglobin A1c testing for individuals with diabetes;international normalized ratio testing for individuals with liver disease or bleeding disorders;low-density lipoprotein testing for individuals with heart disease;statins for individuals with heart disease or diabetes; andselective\u00a0serotonin reuptake inhibitors for individuals with depression.\u00a0The bill provides statutory authority for the IRS's guidance.\u00a0"
