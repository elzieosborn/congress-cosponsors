The installation was originally designated as Fort Bragg for Confederate general Braxton Bragg, and was changed to Fort Liberty in 2023. On February 10, 2025, the Department of Defense issued a memorandum to rename it to Fort Bragg, in honor of Army PFC Roland Bragg, who served during World War II.</summary>
