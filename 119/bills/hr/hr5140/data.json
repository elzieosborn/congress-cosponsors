However, an individual who is 16 years of age or older may be tried as an adult if the individual is charged with\u00a0murder, first-degree sexual abuse, burglary in the first degree, robbery while armed, or assault with intent to commit any such offense. Additionally, an individual who is 15 years of age or older may be tried as an adult if the individual is alleged to have committed a felony and\u00a0it is determined that (1) it is in the interest of the public welfare to try the individual as an adult, and (2) there are no reasonable prospects for the individual's rehabilitation.\n\nThe bill lowers the minimum age to be tried as an adult in these cases to 14 years of age."
