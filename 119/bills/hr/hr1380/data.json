Further, the bill grants the office the authority to bring any civil or administrative action authorized by that act.\n\nAdditionally, the office must\n\nserve as a liaison to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission with respect to competition and trade practices in the food and agricultural sector,consult with the Department of Homeland Security on national security and critical infrastructure security in the food and agricultural sector, andmaintain a staff of attorneys and other professionals with appropriate expertise.As background,\u00a0the purposes of the P&S\u00a0Act are to\u00a0assure fair competition and trade practices, safeguard farmers and ranchers, protect consumers, and protect livestock, meat, and poultry industry members from unfair, deceptive, unjustly discriminatory, and monopolistic practices.\u00a0Those engaged in the business of marketing livestock, meat, and poultry in commerce are subject to the P&S\u00a0Act."
