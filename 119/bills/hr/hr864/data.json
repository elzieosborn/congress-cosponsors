    "text": "Freedom to Cooperate Act\n\nThis bill addresses issues related to state and local government cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nA state may not prohibit its personnel or another government entity from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts or making inquiries about an individual's immigration status. Currently, a government entity is only barred from prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nDHS may issue a detainer if there is probable cause to believe that an individual arrested for any criminal or motor vehicle offense is inadmissible or deportable.\n\nFurthermore, the bill provides legal immunity for a state or local government entity or official temporarily detaining a non-U.S. national under federal authority."
