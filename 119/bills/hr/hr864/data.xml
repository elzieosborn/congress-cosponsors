This bill addresses issues related to state and local government cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

A state may not prohibit its personnel or another government entity from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts or making inquiries about an individual's immigration status. Currently, a government entity is only barred from prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

DHS may issue a detainer if there is probable cause to believe that an individual arrested for any criminal or motor vehicle offense is inadmissible or deportable.

Furthermore, the bill provides legal immunity for a state or local government entity or official temporarily detaining a non-U.S. national under federal authority.</summary>
