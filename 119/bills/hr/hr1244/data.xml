This bill requires the coinsurance amount for covered drugs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit to be based on the actual acquisition cost of the drug (i.e., the negotiated price under the prescription drug plan net of any manufacturer price concessions), rather than the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug, if the actual acquisition cost is lower.</summary>
