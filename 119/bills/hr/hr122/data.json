    "text": "Original Living American Wage Act or the Original LAW Act\n\nThis bill increases the federal minimum wage according to a formula specified in the bill.\n\nFirst, the bill increases the minimum hourly wage to $10.59\u00a0beginning on January 1, 2026, and increases the minimum hourly wage by $4 annually from January 1, 2027,\u00a0through January 1, 2030.\n\nNext, beginning on January 1, 2031, the Department of Labor shall increase the minimum hourly wage every seven years\u00a0according to a specified formula.\n\nThe formula establishes the minimum hourly wage as the wage sufficient for a person working 1,799 hours per year (approximately 35 hours per week) to earn an annual income that is 40%\u00a0higher than the federal supplemental poverty threshold for a renter family of four, with two children under the age of 18, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the preceding year. However, if this formula results in a reduction, the minimum\u00a0hourly wage may not be lowered.\u00a0"
