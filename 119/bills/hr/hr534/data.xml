This bill requires the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service to allow border states to place temporary, movable structures on federal lands adjacent to the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico borders without a special use authorization.

Border states may place these structures on such lands for the purpose of securing the northern or southern border for a period of not more than one year. Interior and the Forest Service must approve extension requests in 90-day increments if U.S. Customs and Border Protection determines that operational control of the border area has not been achieved.</summary>
