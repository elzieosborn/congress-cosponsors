  <summary date="2025-05-07T23:17:26Z" status="Introduced in House">Deport Illegal Voters Act of 2025

This bill increases immigration restrictions for&#160;non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who vote in violation of a federal, state, or local constitutional provision, statute, ordinance, or regulation. Specifically, the bill adds such an act to the list of aggravated felonies that are grounds for deportation and inadmissibility.

Under current law, this act is generally grounds for deportation and inadmissibility. However, an exception exists for individuals who, in addition to other requirements, reasonably believed at the time of such act that they were citizens.</summary>
