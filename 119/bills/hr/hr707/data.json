Specifically, the bill adds such an act to the list of aggravated felonies that are grounds for deportation and inadmissibility.\n\nUnder current law, this act is generally grounds for deportation and inadmissibility. However, an exception exists for individuals who, in addition to other requirements, reasonably believed at the time of such act that they were citizens."
