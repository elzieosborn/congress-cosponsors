  <summary date="2025-03-11T19:01:36Z" status="Introduced in House">Water Rights Protection Act of 2025

This bill limits the transfer of&#160;water rights from water users to the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture (USDA).

First, the bill&#160;prohibits Interior and USDA from conditioning the issuance or renewal of&#160;land use or occupancy agreements (e.g., permits and leases) on the transfer of any water right to the United States. Next, it prohibits Interior and USDA from&#160;requiring water users, including Indian tribes,&#160;to acquire water rights in the name of the United States as a condition of the issuance or renewal of a land use or occupancy agreement. Finally, it prohibits Interior and USDA from&#160;conditioning or withholding the issuance or renewal of land use or occupancy agreements on (1) limiting the date, time, quantity, location of diversion or pumping, or place of use of a&#160;state water right beyond any applicable limitations under&#160;state water law; or (2)&#160;modifying&#160;the terms and conditions of groundwater withdrawal, guidance and reporting procedures, or conservation and source protection measures established by a state.

Interior and&#160;USDA must also ensure that federal action imposes no greater restriction or regulatory requirement than under applicable state water law.

Further, Interior and USDA must not take actions that adversely affect state authority in permitting water usage or in adjudicating water rights.</summary>
