Next, it prohibits Interior and USDA from\u00a0requiring water users, including Indian tribes,\u00a0to acquire water rights in the name of the United States as a condition of the issuance or renewal of a land use or occupancy agreement. Finally, it prohibits Interior and USDA from\u00a0conditioning or withholding the issuance or renewal of land use or occupancy agreements on (1) limiting the date, time, quantity, location of diversion or pumping, or place of use of a\u00a0state water right beyond any applicable limitations under\u00a0state water law; or (2)\u00a0modifying\u00a0the terms and conditions of groundwater withdrawal, guidance and reporting procedures, or conservation and source protection measures established by a state.\n\nInterior and\u00a0USDA must also ensure that federal action imposes no greater restriction or regulatory requirement than under applicable state water law.\n\nFurther, Interior and USDA must not take actions that adversely affect state authority in permitting water usage or in adjudicating water rights."
