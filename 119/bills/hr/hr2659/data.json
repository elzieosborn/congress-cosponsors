The task force must facilitate collaboration and coordination among the Sector Risk Management Agencies\u00a0(SRMAs) specified in the President's National Security Memorandum- 22 (e.g.,\u00a0the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Agriculture) to detect, analyze, and respond to Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors\u00a0by ensuring that such agencies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions are aligned and mutually reinforcing.\n\nThe bill directs\u00a0DHS, CISA, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and specified SRMAs\u00a0to provide the task force with analysis, inspections, audits, and other relevant information necessary for\u00a0the task force to carry out its responsibilities.\u00a0The production and use of information must comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, and executive orders, and task force members must have appropriate security clearances to access classified information.\n\nThe task force must\u00a0provide annual reports and briefings to Congress detailing its assessment of cyber threats and recommendations to improve the detection and mitigation of the cybersecurity threat posed by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors.\n\nThe first report must be provided no later than 540 days after the establishment of the task force, and additional reports must be provided annually thereafter for six years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
