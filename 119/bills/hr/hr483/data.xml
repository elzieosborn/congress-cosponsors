This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to delay certain requirements relating to the reporting of quality measures by accountable care organizations (ACOs) and to also test alternative reporting methods for ACOs.

Specifically, the CMS must delay the requirement that ACOs use a specified electronic system for reporting quality measures until January 1, 2030. Additionally, the CMS must establish a pilot program to test other digital reporting methods; ACOs that participate in the pilot program are exempt from using the existing electronic system.&#160;

The CMS must also implement standards for digital reporting by January 1, 2030, that ensure all electronic health record systems used by ACOs are able to support reporting across a range of practice sizes, specialties, and geographic locations. ACOs may use existing reporting methods until the standards are implemented.</summary>
