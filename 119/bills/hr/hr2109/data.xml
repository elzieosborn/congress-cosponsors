This bill amends the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Circuit Rider Program to include cybersecurity technical assistance for rural water systems serving fewer than 10,000 people. Under the program, USDA provides technical assistance to rural water systems that are experiencing day-to-day operational, financial, or managerial issues.

Specifically, the program's cybersecurity technical assistance must (1) assess system efficacy in protecting against cyber threats; and (2) implement cybersecurity plans, procedures, and technologies to protect against cyber threats.

The bill also reauthorizes the Circuit Rider Program through FY2030.</summary>
