Under the program, USDA provides technical assistance to rural water systems that are experiencing day-to-day operational, financial, or managerial issues.\n\nSpecifically, the program's cybersecurity technical assistance must (1) assess system efficacy in protecting against cyber threats; and (2) implement cybersecurity plans, procedures, and technologies to protect against cyber threats.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes the Circuit Rider Program through FY2030."
