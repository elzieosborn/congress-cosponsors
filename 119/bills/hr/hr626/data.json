    "text": "Northwest Energy Security Act\n\nThis bill requires Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) operations to be consistent with the preferred alternative in a\u00a02020 environmental impact statement (EIS)\u00a0decision that focuses on the operations, maintenance, and configuration of dams in the system rather than wild fish restoration. The system includes dams in the Columbia and Snake rivers in Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Idaho.\n\nSpecifically, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Bonneville Power Administration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must operate the FCRPS consistent with the Columbia River System Operations Environmental Impact Statement Record of Decision dated September 2020. Thus, Reclamation,\u00a0the Bonneville Power Administration, and the Army Corps must follow the EIS rather than the 2023 Resilient Columbia Basin Initiative\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a\u00a0supplemental EIS proposed in 2024\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat focus on wild fish restoration in the Columbia Basin.\n\nThe EIS decision may be amended if each agency determines that (1) changes are necessary for public safety or electrical grid reliability, or (2) certain requirements in the decision are no longer necessary.\n\nFurther, the bill requires statutory authorization for any structural modification, action, study, or engineering plan that (1) restricts FCRPS hydroelectric dam generation; or (2) limits navigation on the Snake River in Washington, Oregon, or Idaho."
