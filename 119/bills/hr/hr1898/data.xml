This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to report on the feasibility of installing a traffic alert and collision avoidance system in each military rotary-wing aircraft. Additionally, DOD must also report on the feasibility of installing automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast IN (ADS-B IN) capability in each military rotary-wing aircraft. (ADS-B IN generally provides operators of properly equipped aircraft with weather and traffic position information.)</summary>
