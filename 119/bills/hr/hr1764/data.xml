This bill exempts from securities regulations any securities issued by the International Development Association (IDA)&#160;of the World Bank. The association provides loans and grants to developing countries. The Securities and Exchange Commission may suspend this exemption at any time.

The bill does not apply if, before the bill's date of enactment, the Department of the Treasury reports that IDA is providing financial support to a country whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Department of State.&#160;</summary>
