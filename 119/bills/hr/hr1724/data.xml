  <summary date="2025-05-01T13:25:11Z" status="Introduced in House">No Dollars to Uyghur Forced Labor Act

This bill prohibits the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development from spending funds on a policy, program, or contract that knowingly uses goods from China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) or produced by entities associated with forced labor in XUAR.

This prohibition includes goods from (1) the XUAR; (2) entities that source materials from the XUAR; or (3) entities involved with forced labor from the XUAR, such as entities in the XUAR that manufacture goods with forced labor or entities working with the XUAR government to transport forced laborers.

The State Department may waive this prohibition, after notifying Congress, if it obtains written assurance that the relevant program partner (1) will not use goods produced in the XUAR for the program, and (2) will develop a system to ensure compliance with the bill's prohibitions.</summary>
