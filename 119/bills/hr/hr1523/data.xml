This bill&#160;allows health care entities to provide virtual services under the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program for an additional three years.

The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program&#160;offers Medicare beneficiaries who are at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes specialized training and education regarding diet, exercise, and other behavioral changes. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued temporary authorization for entities participating in the program to provide these services virtually until December 31, 2027.

The bill extends the authorization for virtual services until December 31, 2030.</summary>
