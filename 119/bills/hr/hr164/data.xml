This bill authorizes electric utilities receiving certain emergency assistance for the restoration of power&#160;to also carry out cost-effective hazard mitigation activities in combination with the power restoration activities. &#160;

Additionally, the bill specifies that electric utilities receiving such assistance for a facility may, if otherwise eligible, also receive hazard mitigation assistance for the same facility under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Public Assistance program.&#160;</summary>
