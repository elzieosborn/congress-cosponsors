  <summary date="2025-04-28T20:01:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Care Workforce Innovation Act of 2025

This bill establishes the Health Care Workforce Innovation Program within the Health Resources and Services Administration to provide grants to federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, and post-secondary vocational programs for developing education and training for allied health professionals (e.g., professionals providing clinical or&#160;non-clinical support services, community health workers, and health education specialists).

Specifically, grant recipients must use the funds to carry out innovative, community-based programs to train allied health professionals, with a focus on supporting rural and underserved areas. Grant recipients may use the funds to launch or expand health care professional partnerships&#160;(e.g., between a grant recipient and a school), establish apprenticeship or other career programs, or invest in training equipment, among other activities.</summary>
