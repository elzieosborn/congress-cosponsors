This bill requires the Science and Technology Directorate in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a department-wide policy for safeguarding research and development from unauthorized access or disclosures of sensitive information in related acquisitions.

Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on the compliance of DHS with a 2021 presidential memorandum and related guidance that required certain disclosures about government-funded research and development (e.g., conflicts of interest involving foreign governments).</summary>
