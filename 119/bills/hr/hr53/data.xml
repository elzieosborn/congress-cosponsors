This bill prohibits the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) from implementing changes to the single-family home loan pricing framework for upfront fees on certain home loans, announced in January 2023. The changes revise the fee charts that provide percentage adjustments based on a borrower's credit score and other risk factors.&#160;Overall, these changes increase the percentage adjustments, with variations based on the particular risk profile of the loan.</summary>
