  <description>An amendment numbered 67 printed in House Report 116-459 to prohibit funds from being used by the EPA to finalize, implement, or en force the proposed rule, Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter published in the Federal Register by the Environmental Protection Agency on April 30, 2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 24094 et seq.), which fails to protect, within an adequate margin of safety, communities of color from harmful air pollution during a global public health pandemic, where those communities are experiencing a disproportionately high death rate made worse by decades of exposure to toxic pollution.</description>
