This bill allows the use of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance qualified broadband projects. A qualified broadband project is any project that is designed solely to provide broadband service to one or more rural areas in which more than 50% of residential households do not have access to adequate broadband service. The bill also allows direct payments to issuers of broadband infrastructure bonds for 35% of the interest payable under such bonds.</summary>
