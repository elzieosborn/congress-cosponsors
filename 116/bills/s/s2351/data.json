The Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security shall bar such foreign persons from entering the United States and revoke visas belonging to such persons.\n\nThe State Department shall report to Congress about the extent to which Saudi Arabia is responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights and about\u00a0U.S. actions to address such violations. The report shall also describe the publication by\u00a0Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Education of intolerant educational materials and U.S. actions to encourage an end\u00a0to the production and use of such materials."
