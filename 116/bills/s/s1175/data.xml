This bill revises the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program under the Federal Direct Loan program.

Under current law, the PSLF program forgives the balance of a borrower's student debt after the borrower makes 120 qualifying loan payments under specified repayment plans while employed in a public service job. The bill expands the program to include payments under graduated or extended plans as payments that qualify a borrower for loan forgiveness under the PSLF program.

The bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to provide each borrower who has submitted a certification of employment under the PSLF program with a notification related to changes made to the program and a calculation of the borrower's monthly payments that count toward loan forgiveness.

It also requires ED to establish a dispute resolution process.</summary>
