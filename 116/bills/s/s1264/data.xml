This bill prohibits a federal employee from receiving federal retirement benefits if the employee (1) has been convicted of certain crimes relating to the sexual abuse of children, or (2) willfully remains outside the United States to avoid prosecution for such crimes.

Additionally, the bill requires that, for an individual convicted of such crimes, a computation of any refund of retirement contributions must exclude any interest for the period after the conviction.
