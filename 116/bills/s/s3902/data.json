The President must consult with Congress, in every instance possible, before invoking the authority to use military force.\n\nThe bill terminates the authority to use military force to suppress an insurrection after 14 days unless Congress enacts a joint resolution extending such authority. It also sets forth provisions for expedited consideration of a joint resolution in the House of Representative and the Senate.\n\nThe bill allows individuals or entities who have been injured by, or have a credible fear of injury from, the use of military force to bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief."
