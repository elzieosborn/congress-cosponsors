This bill establishes or modifies provisions to provide for standardized government-wide financial management requirements.

Each agency Chief Financial Officer must oversee and provide leadership in the areas of budget formulation and execution, planning and performance, risk management, internal controls, financial systems, and accounting.

The bill requires the government-wide financial management plan to include actions for improving financial management systems, strengthening the federal financial management workforce, and linking performance and cost information to budget decision-making.

The bill requires (1) the development of financial management performance-based metrics, and (2) an assessment of performance by such metrics to be included in the government-wide and agency-level financial management plans and status reports. Specifically, each agency shall annually assess and make a conclusion on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting and key financial management information.</summary>
