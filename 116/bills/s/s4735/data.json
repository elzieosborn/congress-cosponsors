The bill also establishes a penalty for authorized providers of electronic filing services that fail to comply with electronic return security standards. Further, the Internal Revenue Service must develop an organizational plan to coordinate all aspects of its efforts to protect return information while it is being held or transmitted by authorized providers of electronic filing services.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development must report on aspects of the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), including (1) the adequacy of Ginnie Mae's guarantee fee for single-family mortgage-backed securities, (2) the workforce composition and workforce challenges of Ginnie Mae, and (3) alternate ways of overseeing Ginnie Mae.\n\nAdditionally, the Navy must submit a specified report after identifying a critical operating and support cost estimate breach in a major defense ship acquisition program."
