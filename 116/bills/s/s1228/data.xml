  <summary date="2021-09-21T12:41:17Z" status="Passed Senate">Preventing Illegal Radio Abuse Through Enforcement Act or the PIRATE Act

This bill addresses unlicensed radio broadcasting (called pirating), including by increasing to $2 million the maximum fine for a pirate radio broadcasting violation and imposing a fine of up to $100,000 per day for pirating violations subject to the $2 million limit.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must (1) annually submit to Congress a report summarizing implementation of this bill and associated enforcement activities for the previous fiscal year; and (2) at least once a year, assign appropriate enforcement personnel to focus specific and sustained attention on the elimination of pirate radio broadcasting within the top five radio markets.

The FCC may not preempt any state or local law prohibiting pirate radio broadcasting.

The FCC shall (1) revise its rules to require that, absent good cause, in any case alleging a violation, it shall proceed directly to issue a Notice of Apparent Liability without first issuing a Notice of Unlicensed Operations; and (2) publish a database of all licensed radio stations operating in the AM and FM band that includes each licensed station and all entities that have received a Notice of Unlicensed Operation, Notice of Apparent Liability, or Forfeiture Order from the FCC.</summary>
