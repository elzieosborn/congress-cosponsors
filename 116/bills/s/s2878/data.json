It also sets out requirements related to these court orders and testing procedures for facial recognition technology systems used by federal agencies.\n\nAn individual who has been the subject of ongoing surveillance in violation of this bill may move to suppress information obtained by the surveillance in court, administrative, or similar proceedings."
