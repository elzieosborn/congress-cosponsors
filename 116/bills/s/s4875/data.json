Lenders are shielded from such enforcement actions brought under any federal, state, or other criminal or civil law or regulation.\n\nBorrowers under the program are only subject to a related enforcement action or penalty if the borrower commits fraud or makes certain prohibited expenses with loan proceeds.\n\nLoans under the program must be excluded from an asset threshold calculation made by a lending institution.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is prohibited from exercising oversight authority over any lender regarding their participation in the program."
