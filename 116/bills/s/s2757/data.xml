This bill prohibits an agency from imposing a civil fine on a small business for a first-time paperwork violation, with the exceptions that the agency may levy a fine for a violation that (1) interferes with the detection of criminal activity; (2) contravenes an internal revenue law; or (3) endangers public health, safety, or the environment. However, an agency must track each first-time violation and report each waiver or reduction of a civil penalty for the violation.</summary>
