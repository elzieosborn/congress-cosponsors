This bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop and implement a plan to make certain operational models available to the public and periodically review innovations and improvements made to such models in order to improve the accuracy and timeliness of NOAA forecasts.

In developing and implementing the plan, NOAA may make accommodations to ensure the public release of any model, information, documentation, or data does not jeopardize

 national security; intellectual property or redistribution rights; certain trade secrets, commercial information, or financial information; any models or data that are otherwise restricted by contract or other written agreement; or its mission to protect lives and property. NOAA must prioritize making available to the public operational models that it developed.</summary>
