    "text": "This bill modifies provisions related to journalistic independence and the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees public service media networks that provide news and information in countries where the press is restricted.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes a noninterference standard that provides U.S. international broadcasting with the expectation that other U.S. government agencies or officials shall not interfere with its journalists. It also requires the Department of State and the Broadcast Board of Governors to (1) respect the professional independence and integrity of the USAGM, its broadcasting services, and its grantees; (2) protect USAGM journalists from undue interference by U.S. government agencies or officials; and (3) ensure that USAGM employees are judged solely on the basis of their adherence to professional standards of broadcast journalism.\n\nFurther, the bill requires the Inspector General of the State Department and the Foreign Service to investigate any potential infringements to journalistic independence by senior USAGM officials or other federal officials."
