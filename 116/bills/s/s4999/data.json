    "text": "Emergency Direct Payments for Families and Workers Act of 2020\n\nThis bill allows individual taxpayers an additional 2020 recovery rebate in the form of a refundable income tax credit in the amount of $1,200 ($2,400 for joint returns). An additional $500 rebate is provided to each qualifying child of the taxpayer. A recovery rebate is a one-time stimulus payment made to eligible taxpayers in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.\n\nThe amount of the recovery rebate is reduced by a specified percentage of the amount an individual's adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns).\n\nIndividual taxpayers and their children must have a valid identification number (i.e., Social Security account number) to claim a rebate.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must conduct a public awareness campaign to inform taxpayers of the availability of the rebate."
