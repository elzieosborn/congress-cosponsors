Among other elements, the report should include the number of female participants by military department, the number of courses held under the program, and the locations where the courses were held.\n\n(Sec. 3) The VA is authorized to furnish transportation in connection with the receipt of covered health care services for a newborn child of a woman veteran (and the child's parents). The bill expands covered health care services to include services furnished at health care facilities other than the facility where the child was delivered.\n\nUnder the bill, the VA may furnish more than seven days of health care services and transportation to such services if a child is in need of additional care.\n\nExpenses incurred for transportation furnished in order for a newborn child of a veteran to receive health care services between May 5, 2010, and the enactment of this bill may be waived or reimbursed to the veteran by the VA."
