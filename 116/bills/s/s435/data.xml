This bill directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to require each federal agency to accept electronic identity proofing and authentication processes that allow an individual, under the Privacy Act, to access the individual's records or to provide prior written consent for the disclosure of the individual's records.

OMB must (1) create a template for electronic consent and access forms, and (2) require each agency to accept such forms from any individual properly identity proofed and authenticated.</summary>
