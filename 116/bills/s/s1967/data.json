Permittees issued a special recreation permit may voluntarily and temporarily return one or more of their service days.\n\nThe bill sets forth requirements for review by USDA of the renewal or adjustment of the allocations for the use of a special recreation permit.\n\nInterior and USDA may enter into agreements with states to allow the purchase of federal and state recreation passes in the same transaction.\n\nThe bill establishes a National Recreation Area System."
