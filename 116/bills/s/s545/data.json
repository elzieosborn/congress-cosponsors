Under the program, grants must be given to partnerships between (1) certain institutions of higher education, and (2) high-need local educational agencies or high-need early childhood education programs. Grants may be awarded for up to five years. In awarding the grants, ED must give preference to partnerships that recruit and enroll teachers who are from underrepresented populations or former English learners."
