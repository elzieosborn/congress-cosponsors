    "text": "WIC Enrollment Collaboration Act of 2020\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to report on the extent to which pregnant women, postpartum women (not more than one year postpartum), infants, and young children receiving benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) or Medicaid benefits are certified to participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, Children (WIC).\n\nThe report must include for each state (1) the monthly average of participants that received benefits under SNAP or Medicaid in the preceding year and for Medicaid purposes are a member of a family whose income was less than maximum income limit for free and reduced price meals, and (2) the percentage of participants that received benefits under SNAP or Medicaid who were certified to receive WIC.\n\nAdditionally, each state must implement an annual cross-enrollment plan that includes (1) goals for increasing the percentage of participants that received benefits under SNAP or Medicaid who were certified to receive WIC in the preceding year; (2) measures the state will carry out to achieve those goals, including by making improvements or modifications to information systems, data matching, or enhancing referrals; and (3) a time line for the state to implement such measures.\n\nUSDA must award competitive grants to states to implement a cross-enrollment plan in the state or to increase the percentage of such participants who were certified to receive WIC. Additionally, USDA must provide technical or training assistance to the states to increase the percentage."
