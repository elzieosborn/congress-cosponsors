The bill requires specified annual reports on the films disclosed pursuant to such limitation.\n\nThe President may not authorize the provision of such support, access, or authorization of such a contract if (1) the film is co-produced by an entity located in China that is subject to conditions on content imposed by a Chinese official or the Chinese Communist Party, or (2) the company is listed in the most recent annual report."
