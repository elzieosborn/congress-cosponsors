    "text": "Fair Chance at Housing Act of 2019\n\nThis bill limits the authority\u00a0of public housing agencies (PHAs) to deny or terminate\u00a0federally assisted housing based on criminal conduct by the applicant or\u00a0tenant.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, PHAs may deny or terminate assistance based only on criminal conduct that threatens the health or safety of other tenants or the employees or owner of the PHA, excluding misdemeanors and certain other lesser criminal offenses. Furthermore, with respect to applicants, a denial may be based only on a\u00a0felony conviction\u00a0other than a conviction\u00a0for\u00a0a drug offense for which the\u00a0individual served less than 10 years.\n\nBefore denying or terminating assistance based on criminal conduct, a PHA must conduct an individualized review and consider specified factors, including evidence of rehabilitation.\u00a0PHAs must also give the household an opportunity to remove the culpable member before proceeding with the denial or termination.\n\nAdditionally, PHAs may not drug test applicants or tenants as a condition of assistance.\n\nUnder current law, PHAs must\u00a0deny, and may terminate, federally assisted housing upon\u00a0a determination that any household member is illegally using a controlled substance. Current law also allows PHAs to take such actions if there is reasonable cause to believe that a household member's illegal use of a controlled substance or abuse of alcohol may interfere with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents. Further, tenants evicted on the basis of drug-related criminal activity are not eligible under current law for federally assisted housing for three years, unless the tenant successfully completes a rehabilitation program."
