This bill expands eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance. Specifically, the bill adjusts the type of service that entitles a member of the Armed Forces, reserves, or National Guard to such assistance.

Such service includes training, active military service, inactive training, and general duty for which basic pay is warranted.</summary>
