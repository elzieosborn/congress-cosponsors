However, the bill provides an exemption from this prohibition during an emergency declared by the President, a governor, or an authorized elected local official.\n\nLastly, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that such\u00a0governments or affiliates intending to provide public telecommunications services should consider public-private partnerships."
