This bill restricts state, local, or tribal governments from prohibiting or inhibiting such government entities or their affiliates from serving as public providers of telecommunications services or advanced telecommunications capabilities to any person or any public or private entity.

The bill prohibits such&#160;public providers from favoring themselves over competing providers in the application of regulations, ordinances, public rights-of-way, or permitting requirements. However, the bill provides an exemption from this prohibition during an emergency declared by the President, a governor, or an authorized elected local official.

Lastly, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that such&#160;governments or affiliates intending to provide public telecommunications services should consider public-private partnerships.</summary>
