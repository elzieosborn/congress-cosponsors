A \"restrictive employment agreement\" is any agreement between two or more employers that prohibits or restricts one employer from soliciting or hiring another employer's employees or former employees.\n\nAny employer that has in effect a franchise agreement that includes a restrictive employment agreement that was entered into before enactment of this bill must amend the franchise agreement to remove such agreement.\n\nThe bill allows aggrieved individuals to bring a civil action for actual and punitive damages, plus attorney's fees, against an entity that enters into, or threatens to enforce, or fails to remove, a restrictive employment agreement.\n\nThe bill grants the Federal Trade Commission the power to enforce the requirements of this bill."
