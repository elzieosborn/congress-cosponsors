This bill prohibits a voice or internet service provider from terminating service to a customer during the national emergency declared due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and for 180 days thereafter.

A provider that terminated voice or internet service to a customer following the emergency declaration and prior to the enactment of this bill must resume providing such service upon the date of enactment.

Terminating or failing to resume providing such service will result in a forfeiture penalty, and the proceeds of any such penalties collected shall be used to provide assistance to low-income individuals who lack access to affordable broadband service due to COVID-19.</summary>
