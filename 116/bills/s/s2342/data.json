Specifically, data brokers are prohibited from acquiring such brokered personal information through fraud or for specified illegal purposes, such as fraud, identity theft, or discrimination. Data brokers also must implement safeguards to prevent security breaches that result in the improper disclosure of brokered personal information. Additionally, data brokers must register with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on an annual basis and the FTC must make this registry publicly available. Violations of these requirements are enforceable by the FTC as an unfair or deceptive business practice."
