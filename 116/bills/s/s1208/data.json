    "text": "Protecting America's First Responders Act\n\nThis bill revises the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program. The program provides disability benefits to public safety officers who are injured in the line of duty and provides death and education benefits to survivors of public safety officers who are killed in the line of duty.\n\nSpecifically, the bill revises the payment amount of disability benefits for claims pending for more than one year. The amount must be based on the date of the adjudication of such claim rather than the date of the injury. The bill also increases the interim benefit payment amount and adjusts it based on the Consumer Price Index.\n\nAdditionally, the payment amount of death benefits must be the greater of (1) the amount payable as of the date of the public safety officer's death, or (2) the amount payable based on the date of the adjudication of the claim. Currently, such amount is based only on the date of death.\n\nNext, the bill includes within the definition of firefighter for purposes of benefits an individual whose primary duty during an emergency response is to secure the scene or manage traffic.\n\nFurther, the bill allows applicants who were denied benefits in the previous three years to reapply for benefits.\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Assistance of the Department of Justice (DOJ) must use all available investigative tools, including subpoenas, to (1) expedite the processing of a claimant's eligibility for a death, disability, or education benefit; and (2) obtain necessary information from third parties (e.g., public agencies).\n\nDOJ must provide retroactive educational assistance to eligible survivors of public safety officers.\n\nIn addition, DOJ must collect data on law enforcement officers who were killed or permanently disabled while on duty.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the average medical costs incurred by a disabled law enforcement officer over the officer's lifetime."
