  <summary date="2021-02-24T23:01:20Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 2020 

This bill addresses the security of active and retired federal judges and their immediate families, including by limiting the release of these protected individuals' personally identifiable information.

Specifically, federal agencies may not publicly post a protected individual's personally identifiable information. Furthermore, upon receiving a written request from a protected individual, an agency must within 72 hours remove any such information relating to the individual that has already been posted.

The Department of Justice must award grants to state and local governments to help prevent the release of protected individuals' personally identifiable information.

Additionally, data brokers may not sell the personally identifiable information of a protected individual. Upon receiving a written request from a protected individual, a private party (1) shall not publicly disclose personally identifiable information relating to the individual, and (2) must remove any such information already posted on the internet.

A protected individual may sue to enforce the bill's provisions.

The bill also authorizes additional security for protected individuals, including by providing home intrusion detection systems and expanding the availability of U.S. Marshals Service protection.</summary>
