This bill expands the use of federal incentive payments to states under the Child Support Enforcement Program to include establishing agreements for how much time a child spends with each parent as agreed to by the parents under a child support or medical support order. Generally, the incentive payments program provides funding based on a state's performance measures related to (1) establishing paternity, (2) the number of cases with child support orders in place, (3) the collection of current and past-due support payments, and (4) cost-effectiveness.</summary>
