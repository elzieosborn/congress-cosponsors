The bill also requires annual appropriations for each of these agencies to be at least the amount appropriated for FY2019.\n\nThe bill exempts appropriations provided pursuant to this bill from sequestration. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals."
