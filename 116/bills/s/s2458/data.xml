This bill require certain adjustments to the discretionary spending limits for FY2020-FY2024 to accommodate increases in appropriations for agencies that conduct agricultural research.

The bill requires adjustments for the following agencies within the Department of Agriculture:

 the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The bill also requires annual appropriations for each of these agencies to be at least the amount appropriated for FY2019.

The bill exempts appropriations provided pursuant to this bill from sequestration. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.</summary>
