    "text": "Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act of 2019\n\nThis bill addresses Medicare coverage for and access to treatment for chronic kidney disease. Specifically, the bill modifies provisions related to coverage by (1) allowing certain Medicare beneficiaries who have End Stage Renal Disease to enroll in Medicare supplemental policies, and (2) establishing new Medicare payment structures for renal dialysis services. Among other changes, the bill (1) provides for alternative payment methodologies for certain new drugs, biologics, and devices that are renal dialysis services; (2) revises quality measures; (3) establishes an incentive payment methodology; and (4) increases access to kidney disease education services.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires information sharing between hospitals and renal dialysis centers in some circumstances as well as federal studies on issues related to kidney disease, including the use of palliative care and\u00a0ways to increase\u00a0transplantation rates.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services may also award National Health Services Corps scholarships and loan repayment to nephrology health professionals."
