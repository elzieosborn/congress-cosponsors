This bill provides qualifying teachers with a new, incremental&#160;loan-cancellation program.

Specifically, with respect to a 12-month period,&#160;the Department of Education (ED) must cancel a specified portion of a borrower's qualifying Federal Direct Loan program loans if the borrower (1) has made 12 consecutive on-time monthly payments, (2) is employed in a qualifying teaching position at the time of such cancellation, and (3)&#160;was employed in a qualifying teaching position during the period in which the borrower made the 12 payments.&#160;After&#160;a borrower has received such partial loan&#160;cancellation for&#160;a specified&#160;number of years, ED&#160;must cancel the borrower's eligible loans in full.&#160;&#160;

The bill also

 increases and extends funding for teacher training; establishes grants for mentoring and professional development; makes changes to the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education&#160;grant program, including by making early childhood teachers eligible for such grants; requires&#160;ED to award grants to institutions of higher education to subsidize teacher certification and licensing fees for low-income individuals who have accepted a teaching position; expands the Teacher Quality Partnership grant program to include early childhood educators; and expands the centers for excellence grant program to include early childhood educators and school leaders.</summary>
