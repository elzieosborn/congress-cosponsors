This bill prohibits the Department of Justice (DOJ) from taking a certain position in the case of Bullock v. United States Bureau of Land Management. Specifically, DOJ may not argue that an individual exercising the authority of the head of an agency, regardless of the individual's title and the individual serving without congressional consent for over a year, does not violate the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. (That Act generally sets out the means by which an individual may temporarily serve in an executive agency position that requires the advice and consent of the Senate, including the categories of qualifying individuals and the duration of such service.)</summary>
