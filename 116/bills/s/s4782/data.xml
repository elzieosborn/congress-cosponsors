This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive grants to eligible entities (i.e., local educational agencies, educational service agencies, and the Bureau of Indian Education) to improve the indoor air quality in elementary and secondary schools in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.

In addition, ED must consult with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant agencies and national organizations to develop technical guidance for eligible entities to address the safety and health of students and staff. ED must, within 21 days, provide eligible entities with this technical guidance.

A grant recipient must use funds to improve or monitor the indoor air quality, ventilation, or circulation in schools using the technical guidance provided by ED.</summary>
