The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shall ensure that the International Space Station (ISS) remains a viable and productive facility capable of potential U.S. use through at least FY2030.\n\nNASA must submit a strategy that includes how it will transition to a successor platform to the ISS.\n\nThe bill expands the objectives of NASA to include the expansion of permanent human presence beyond Earth in a way that enables human space settlement and a thriving space economy.\n\nNASA shall establish a program of developing space suits and associated technologies."
