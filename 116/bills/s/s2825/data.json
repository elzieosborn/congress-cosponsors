Child care assistance may only be provided once for a child and for a period shorter than six months, but the VA is authorized to waive such limitations.\n\nThe term eligible veteran is defined as a veteran who is the primary caretaker of a child and (1) who is receiving VA training or vocational rehabilitation on a full-time basis, or needs and would receive such training or rehabilitation from the VA but for the lack of child care; and (2) whose family's adjusted gross income meets certain criteria.\n\nThe bill provides for various types of child care assistance, as the VA considers appropriate."
