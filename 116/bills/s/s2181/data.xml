  <summary date="2019-11-26T17:25:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Cybersecurity Standards for Aircraft to Improve Resilience Act of 2019 or the Cyber AIR Act

This bill addresses cyberattacks on aircraft systems and cybersecurity vulnerabilities to the U.S. commercial aviation system.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) must implement regulations to require domestic or foreign air carriers and manufacturers to disclose to the Federal Aviation Administration any attempted or successful cyberattack against any system on board an aircraft or against any maintenance or ground support system for aircraft.

DOT must also incorporate cybersecurity into the requirements for obtaining an air carrier operating certificate or a production certificate.

The Commercial Aviation Communications Safety and Security Leadership Group must (1) evaluate the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of broadband wireless communications equipment designed for consumer use on board aircraft; and (2) require the implementation by air carriers, manufacturers, and communications service providers of security measures it deems necessary to prevent cyberattacks that exploit such equipment.</summary>
