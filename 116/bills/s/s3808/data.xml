This bill expands access to child care for military families.

For example, the bill (1) lowers child development center fees for certain parents who are active-duty service members, (2) requires each military department to implement a fee assistance program for service members who obtain child care services from a civilian provider, and (3) directs each military medical treatment facility to ensure that service members and their spouses who are attending medical appointments at such facilities may obtain child care services for their children on an hourly basis.</summary>
