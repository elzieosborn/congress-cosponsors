  <summary date="2021-09-03T18:30:14Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Responsibility in Drug Advertising Act of 2020

This bill prohibits direct-to-consumer advertising of a drug in the first three years after the drug's approval. The Food and Drug Administration may (1) waive the third year of this prohibition for a drug if direct-to-consumer advertising of the drug would have an affirmative value to public health, or (2) extend the prohibition if the drug has significant adverse health effects.</summary>
