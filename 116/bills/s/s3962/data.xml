This bill repeals restrictions related to brokered deposits and provides for asset growth restrictions applicable to insured depository institutions.

Brokered deposits are deposits made to an insured institution, such as a bank, through a third-party broker for investment purposes. Currently, only well-capitalized banks are allowed to solicit and accept brokered deposits, while institutions that are adequately capitalized may accept if granted a waiver. Undercapitalized banks are prohibited from accepting these deposits.

The bill repeals these brokered deposit restrictions and directs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to establish limits on growth of average total assets for less than well-capitalized institutions to maintain their safety and soundness.</summary>
