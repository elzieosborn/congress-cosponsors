  <summary date="2020-08-31T22:59:05Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires an online retailer to disclose whether articles sold through its platform originate in China.

Specifically, any online retailer selling articles of foreign commerce imported into the United States shall legibly state and conspicuously disclose on the webpage for each such article if the article or any major component thereof originates in China or if the article was manufactured or assembled in China.

The bill also authorizes the Department of the Treasury to determine the acceptable method of disclosure and to authorize the exception of certain articles from disclosure requirements. Further, such disclosure is not required to be made for specified types of products (e.g., coffee and tea, spices, and silk products).</summary>
