Providers must also disclose information regarding (1) an individual's rights with respect to life-sustaining procedures, including hydration and sustenance; and (2) whether parental consent is required to provide, withdraw, or deny life-sustaining procedures, or to institute a do-not-resuscitate order, for a minor."
