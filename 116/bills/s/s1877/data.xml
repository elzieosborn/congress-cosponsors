  <summary date="2022-06-23T15:23:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Government Shutdown Accountability Act

This bill establishes various procedures and requirements for government shutdowns that occur due to a lapse in appropriations.

Among other provisions, the bill

 directs the Office of Personnel Management to designate services related to Federal Employee Health Benefits Program enrollments as excepted services under the Antideficiency Act to require the services to continue during a government shutdown, allows federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay during a government shutdown to seek and obtain employment outside the federal government, limits expenditures for official travel, restricts congressional recesses and adjournments, and prohibits Congress from considering legislation that is unrelated to appropriations or an emergency if a government shutdown is in effect. The provisions that restrict recesses, adjournments, and the consideration of legislation may be waived or suspended by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members of the applicable chamber of Congress.</summary>
