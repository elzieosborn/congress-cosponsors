This bill establishes a framework to prohibit and impose civil penalties for the use of riot control agents (e.g., tear gas) and kinetic impact projectiles (e.g., rubber bullets) by law enforcement officers.

Specifically, it prohibits federal law enforcement officers from using such items while on duty. Additionally, a state or local government must have in effect a similar prohibition and civil penalties to be eligible for funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program and the Community Oriented Policing Services program.</summary>
