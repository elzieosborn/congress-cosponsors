This bill allows the President, in certain circumstances, to (1) negotiate with a foreign country for tariff reductions on exported U.S. goods, or (2) impose additional duties on imported goods. Specifically, the President may take these actions if it is determined that the country (1) when importing a good from the United States, applies a higher rate of duty on that good than the rate imposed by the United States when imported from that country; or (2) similarly imposes other, nontariff trade restrictions on that good.

The President must terminate a rate of duty increase under this bill if the country no longer applies such higher rates or nontariff trade restrictions, or if the higher rate is no longer in the interest of the United States.

Congress may nullify a rate of duty increase implemented under this bill through a joint resolution.

This bill is effective for three years, subject to one three-year renewal.</summary>
