This bill imposes limitations on settlement agreements to which the United States is a party.

With certain exceptions, the United States may not enter into a settlement agreement requiring a payment or loan to an individual or to an entity other than the United States. Exceptions to this prohibition include payments or loans that (1) are intended to directly remedy the harm caused by the paying party and suffered by the recipient, (2) are for services rendered in connection with the case, and (3) are going to a third party for claims against that same third party.</summary>
