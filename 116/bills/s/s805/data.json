In addition, the VA may not take any collection action regarding an overpayment until 90 days after it issues such notice.\n\nThe VA must report on its plan for the improvement of the notification and communication processes for individuals who receive overpayments from the VA.\n\nThe bill prohibits interest and administrative cost charges on delinquent payments of debt resulting from a person's participation in a VA disability compensation program, pension program, or an educational assistance program.\n\nThe VA must establish a minimum debt threshold for when it will report to a consumer reporting agency in relation to a claim or debt arising from receipt of a VA benefit.\n\nThe bill extends the window to request relief from the recovery of debt arising from a person's participation in a VA benefit or program from 180 days to 1 year.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to prescribe an administrative process for the dispute of the existence or amount of debt. The VA is prohibited from deducting any amount of an individual's debt if the cost of recovery would exceed the amount to be recovered.\n\nThe VA must ensure its website and written notices contain all information veterans need regarding how to dispute an indebtedness.\n\nFinally, the VA must ensure that a veteran may remove any dependent from an award of compensation or pension using the VA's system."
