This bill revises the hiring process for air traffic control specialists.

Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to

 give preferential consideration to individuals who have successfully completed air traffic controller training and veterans, consider for the interview stage of the hiring process candidates who score at or above the passing score on the Air Traffic Skills Assessment (AT-SA) and meet minimum qualifications established by the FAA, and revise the AT-SA to ensure that all questions are supported by a peer reviewed job analysis and that it does not incorporate any biographical questionnaire or other questions of a biographical nature.</summary>
