The lawyers for the plaintiffs shall also provide the identity of the outside business.\n\nSpecifically, these requirements shall apply to any class action or multi-district litigation (i.e. related civil cases pending in different districts that are consolidated for pretrial proceedings). \n\n\u00a0"
