    "text": "Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2019\n\nThis bill directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to require fuel containers to include devices that impede flames from entering the container. This requirement applies to flammable, liquid fuel containers of fewer than five gallons that are intended for transport. CPSC may either promulgate a rule or adopt an existing standard. Additionally, CPSC must educate consumers about dangers associated with using or storing such containers near an open flame or a source of ignition. The bill also requires child resistant caps on kerosene and diesel fuel containers. Currently, this only applies to gasoline containers."
