This bill establishes a Maritime Task Force to address the health, safety, security, and logistical issues relating to the continuation of maritime travel, including the resumption of cruise operations, in United States waters during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.

The task force must consist of members from several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Transportation. It must work together with input from private sector stakeholders to develop a plan about policies and procedures that need to be adopted for the safe resumption of the cruise line industry during and after the COVID-19 public health emergency.</summary>
