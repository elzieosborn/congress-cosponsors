This bill prohibits any company doing business in the United States from taking certain actions relating to the government of China.

Specifically, such a company may not (1) make public statements that reflect Chinese government propaganda, except for statements required by a Chinese government regulation to protect health or safety; (2) take actions contrary to its fiduciary interests at the behest of the Chinese government; or (3) furnish personal information about Chinese dissidents to the Chinese government. Such a company shall report to the Department of State and Department of Commerce each instance&#160;in which&#160;the Chinese government attempted to pressure the company to take such prohibited actions.

The bill imposes criminal monetary fines and imprisonment for a company or company official that knowingly violates these prohibitions.</summary>
