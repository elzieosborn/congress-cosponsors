This bill directs the Water Power Technologies Office of the Department of Energy (DOE) to carry out a program to accelerate the introduction of marine energy production into the United States energy supply while fostering accelerated research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of technology, including programs to to identify and study critical short- and long-term needs to create a sustainable marine energy supply chain based in the United States.

DOE must award grants to institutions of higher education for (1) the continuation and expansion of research, development, and testing activities at National Marine Energy Centers established as of January 1, 2019; and (2) the establishment of new centers.

DOE must also conduct a study to examine opportunities for research and development in advanced marine energy technologies to (1) support the maritime transportation sector to enhance job creation, economic development, and competitiveness; (2) support associated maritime energy infrastructure; and (3) enable scientific missions at sea and in extreme environments, including the Arctic.</summary>
