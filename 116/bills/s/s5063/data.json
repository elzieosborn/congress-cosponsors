    "text": "Emergency Direct Payments Act\n\nThis bill provides an additional recovery rebate (i.e., refundable tax credits) beginning in 2020 to individual taxpayers whose adjusted gross income does not exceed $75,000 ($150,000 for joint return filers). The increased amount is $1,200 per taxpayer ($2,400 for joint return filers) and $500 for each dependent of the taxpayer.\n\nTo be eligible for the increased rebate amount, a taxpayer must provide a valid identification number (i.e., Social Security account number). The bill allows an exemption from the identification requirement for members of the Armed Forces if at least one military spouse provides a valid identification number. It also provides for a qualified exemption for the recovery rebate from garnishments and other offsets.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the availability of the recovery rebate."
