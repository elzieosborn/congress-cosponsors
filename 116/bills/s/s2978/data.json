    "text": "Energy and Water Research Integration Act of 2019\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to integrate water considerations into its energy research, development, and demonstration programs and projects.\n\nSpecifically, the DOE must develop and implement a strategic plan\u00a0that advances energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices\u00a0to\n\n minimize freshwater withdrawal and consumption, seismic impacts,\u00a0and\u00a0deleterious impacts on water bodies, groundwater, and waterways; increase water use efficiency; and utilize nontraditional water sources. Further, the strategic plan must (1)\u00a0consider the effects climate variability may have on water supplies and quality for energy generation and fuel production, and (2) improve the understanding of the energy required to provide reliable water supplies as well as the water required to provide reliable energy supplies. The plan must be updated every five years.\n\nIn addition, DOE must establish an Energy-Water Committee to promote and enable improved energy and water resource data collection, reporting, and technological innovation."
