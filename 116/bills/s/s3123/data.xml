This bill provides for the registration of insurance savings and loan holding companies. Certain Federal Reserve Board (FRB) regulations as applied to these companies must be tailored to the insurance business and applicable state insurance requirements.

The bill generally excludes assets attributable to the business of insurance for the purpose of calculating whether these companies are subject to certain FRB assessments and fees.</summary>
