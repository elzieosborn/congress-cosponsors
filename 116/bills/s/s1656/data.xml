This bill revises the effective date of the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) to the date on which the first market area assessment is completed. Such assessments must be completed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to assess factors related to the provision of VA health care services (e.g., the capacity of the VA and providers under the VCCP to provide care).

Additionally, the bill authorizes the VA to furnish care and services under the Veterans Choice Program until the VA has entered into contracts to provide care under the VCCP.</summary>
