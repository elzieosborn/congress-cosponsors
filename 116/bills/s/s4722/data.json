In any civil action in federal or state court for damages in which it is asserted or alleged that an entity acted negligently in the selection or retention of a motor carrier, such entity shall be considered to have acted reasonably and prudently in the selection if it establishes that it verified information relating to the motor carrier through the FMCS."
