The bill also establishes requirements for schools with respect to concussions and excessive heat.\n\nSpecifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must (1) develop information for schools, childcare centers, and others on high-risk cardiac conditions in children, adolescents, and young adults; and (2) incorporate questions about cardiac conditions in an existing\u00a0school-based health survey.\n\nIn addition, the CDC must develop guidelines for emergency action plans for youth athletics programs,\u00a0and the Food and Drug Administration may issue guidelines related to youth consumption of\u00a0energy drinks.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must award matching grants to local educational agencies for automated external defibrillator and cardiopulmonary resuscitation trainings.\n\nThe Department of Education, in consultation with HHS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, must\u00a0develop public education materials focused on the health risks of exposure to extreme heat and humidity, and public schools must develop action plans for athletic activities during periods of excessive heat or humidity.\n\nThe bill establishes minimum requirements for elementary and secondary schools related to concussions, including but not limited to (1) implementing a standard plan for concussion safety and management, and (2) ensuring students returning to academics after a concussion receive certain services and supports."
