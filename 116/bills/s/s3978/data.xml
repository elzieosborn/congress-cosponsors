This bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to report on its plans to pursue a U.S. strategy regarding the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Such plans must (1) facilitate the full implementation of WTO agreements, (2) enable the maximum benefits from trade to accrue to those members of the WTO that face the greatest difficulty integrating into the multilateral trading system, and (3) ensure that certain members of the WTO do not receive special and differential treatment.</summary>
