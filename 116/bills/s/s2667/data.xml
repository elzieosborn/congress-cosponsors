  <summary date="2021-01-07T15:11:05Z" status="Introduced in Senate">FAFSA Simplification Act of 2019

This bill revises certain provisions related to federal financial student aid.

Specifically, the bill replaces the expected family contribution metric with a student aid index used to assess a family's financial need and approximate their financial resources to contribute to a student's higher education expenses.

The bill also revises the process for filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and it removes certain eligibility requirements having to do with drug-related offenses and registration with the Selective Service System.

In addition, the bill reauthorizes the Pell Grant program through FY2021 and establishes a new eligibility formula for Pell Grants. The Department of Education must conduct certain activities to educate students and their families about Pell Grant eligibility at a younger age.</summary>
