This bill expands the hiring authority of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, which was created to oversee loan programs and other forms of financial assistance related to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic that are administered by the Department of the Treasury.

Specifically, the bill allows the office to exercise, for up to six months, the expedited hiring authorities that are afforded to temporary organizations. The office may also hire up to 25 retired governmental employees; such retirees may continue to receive their pensions.</summary>
