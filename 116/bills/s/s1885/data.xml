This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate final rules requiring certain issuers of securities to disclose whether the issuer has established procedures to recoup from compensation paid to its executive officers fines and penalties for illegal behavior. If the issuer has not established such procedures, it must explain why such procedures are not necessary for the benefit of its shareholders.</summary>
