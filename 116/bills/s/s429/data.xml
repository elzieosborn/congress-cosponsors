This bill provides for the establishment of voluntary employee exchange programs relating to cybersecurity positions between the private sector and certain federal agencies.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Justice must each submit to Congress a plan for implementing an exchange program at the agency and an evaluation of the benefits.

 If an agency determines that it is unable to establish the program, it shall submit a notification describing the legal basis for that inability and any other specific factor that prevents its establishment.</summary>
