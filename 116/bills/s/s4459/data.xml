This bill increases from five to nine the membership of the Congressional Oversight Commission that oversees the implementation of specific measures intended to provide economic stability as a result of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. It also requires that at least four members be from a group that has experienced disproportionately negative impacts from the pandemic and the resulting economic recession.</summary>
