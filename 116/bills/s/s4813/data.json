    "text": "Taiwan Relations Reinforcement Act of 2020\n\nThis bill contains provisions pertaining to the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.\n\nThe director of the American Institute in Taiwan's Taipei office shall be subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. (The United States does not have official relations with Taiwan as a result of China's position that Taiwan is part of China. The American Institute in Taiwan is a private organization that represents U.S. interests in Taiwan and provides consular services.)\n\nNo U.S. government department or agency may formally or informally recognize China's claims of sovereignty over Taiwan without the assent of Taiwan's people, as expressed through the democratic process.\n\nThe Department of State shall establish the U.S.-Taiwan Cultural Exchange Foundation, which shall work with schools to send U.S. high school and university students to Taiwan to study the Chinese language, politics, and other subjects.\n\nIn addition, the State Department shall develop and implement a strategy to respond to Chinese government attempts to use misinformation, media manipulation, economic coercion, and other strategies against Taiwan or persons in Taiwan.\n\nThe bill also directs the President to establish an interagency Taiwan policy task force, which shall annually report to Congress a plan for enhancing U.S.-Taiwan relations.\n\nThe bill also requires reports on topics including (1) China's efforts to block Taiwan's participation in international bodies such as the United Nations, and (2) the military posture of Taiwan and the United States as it pertains to conflict deterrence and readiness in the Taiwan Strait."
