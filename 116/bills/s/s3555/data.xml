  <summary date="2021-08-16T14:24:49Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Trade Adjustment Assistance For Workers Reauthorization Act of 2020

This bill revises and reauthorizes through FY2027 the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program.

Specifically, the bill provides trade adjustment assistance for workers, including staffed workers and teleworkers, who experience an employment loss because of supply chain disruptions or weak demand during a public health emergency. Such assistance also extends to workers similarly affected by retaliatory tariff increases.

The bill authorizes the Department of Labor to reimburse workers for certain out-of-pocket training expenses. Labor must take necessary action to apprise eligible workers of available benefits, and affected workers must be provided with information about registered apprenticeship programs and other on-the-job training opportunities in their area.

The bill extends the duration of income support for workers enrolled in a registered apprenticeship program, associate's degree program, or other qualified training program, and it authorizes benefits to be paid to certain workers whose annual income is below a specified threshold.

Employees shall not be considered to have experienced an employment loss due to a plant closing or mass layoff if such closing or layoff is the result of the relocation or consolidation of the employer's business and, prior to such closing or layoff, the employer offers to transfer the employees to certain other sites of employment. If such loss of employment is caused by conditions justifying trade adjustment assistance, the employer must notify its employees of the availability of such assistance.

The bill also extends the tax credit for health insurance costs through 2026 and increases the percentage of such credit.</summary>
