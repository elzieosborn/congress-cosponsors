This bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to publish National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) rate maps for the entire United States (current law directs the mapping of certain risk areas). In developing these rate maps, FEMA must use the most current remote sensing technology.

In coordination with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, FEMA must establish a digital database to display the flood hazard risks of buildings in NFIP. The database must contain specified information about each property, including a certification of the building's elevation. FEMA must provide a one-time premium credit for the purchase of an elevation certificate by a policyholder.

The bill allows reimbursement to local governments that assist FEMA in developing flood risk zone data.</summary>
