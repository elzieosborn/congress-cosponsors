This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish the Cyber Shield Program, a voluntary program to identify and certify covered products. These products are consumer-facing physical objects that meet industry-leading cybersecurity and data security benchmarks and that can (1) connect to the internet; and (2) collect, send, or receive data or control the actions of a physical object or system.

Commerce must also establish a Cyber Shield Advisory Committee to recommend (1) the format and content of Cyber Shield labels for covered products; and (2) the process to identify, establish, report on, adopt, maintain, and promote compliance with industry-leading cybersecurity and data security benchmarks to enhance cybersecurity and protect data.

On its website, Commerce must make publicly available (1) program information, (2) a database of covered products certified under the program, and (3) contact information for each manufacturer of a covered product certified under the program.</summary>
