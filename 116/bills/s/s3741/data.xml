  <summary date="2022-04-14T18:45:37Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Health Care at Home Act of 2020

This bill requires private health insurance plans to cover certain services provided via telecommunications systems (i.e., telehealth) during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. Specifically, the telehealth services must be deemed medically necessary by a health care provider and covered under the plan if provided in person. Plans must apply the same cost-sharing and reimbursement amounts that would otherwise apply to such services and may waive cost-sharing requirements for any services to diagnose or treat COVID-19, including via telehealth.</summary>
