  <summary date="2020-08-14T16:40:09Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Preparing Superfund for Climate Change Act of 2019

This bill requires the consideration of factors related to climate change when selecting remedial actions for the cleanup of Superfund sites (sites contaminated with hazardous substances). Specifically, the potential threat to human health and the environment associated with local natural disasters and extreme weather hazards, including those exacerbated by climate change, must be taken into account when selecting remedial actions.

Under current law, some remedial actions result in hazardous substances remaining at the site, so there must be a review every five years to assure that human health and the environment are being protected. The bill requires such review to include an assessment of whether the selected remedial action remains protective after taking into account local natural disasters and extreme weather hazards, including those exacerbated by climate change.</summary>
