The required payment is the lesser of 90% of the tax for the taxable year or a specified percentage of the preceding year's tax.\n\nFor 2018, the bill reduces the percentage of the preceding year's tax from 100% to 80%. For taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes for the preceding year that exceed $150,000, the bill reduces the percentage from 110% to 100%."
