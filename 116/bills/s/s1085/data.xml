This bill authorizes appropriations through FY2024 to the Department of Energy (DOE) for research, development, engineering, demonstration, and commercial application of innovative vehicle technologies.

Among other things, the bill requires DOE to

 conduct a program on materials, technologies, and processes with the potential to substantially reduce or eliminate petroleum use and the emissions of&#160; U.S. passenger and commercial vehicles, including in the areas of natural gas and hydrogen vehicle technologies, electrification of vehicle systems, and hydraulic hybrid technologies; implement a program of advanced vehicle manufacturing technologies and practices, including innovative processes to increase the production rate and decrease the cost of advanced battery and fuel cell manufacturing; and seek opportunities to leverage resources and support initiatives of state and local governments in developing and promoting advanced vehicle technologies, manufacturing, and infrastructure.</summary>
