Specifically, SAMHSA may award grants to eligible public and nonprofit private entities, including states and drug-free community coalitions, to carry out such programs in\u00a0schools, athletic programs, and\u00a0communities. Among other activities, grant recipients may use funds to educate teachers, campus-based medical providers, and others on signs of opioid misuse and options for treatment and prevention. In addition, SAMHSA must report annually on federal programs to prevent pain medication misuse and addiction."
