This bill eliminates or consolidates various federal reporting requirements.

Such reports include a Transportation Security Administration report on unclaimed money at airports, several required from the Department of Homeland Security (e.g., regarding antidumping and countervailing duties), and reports from the General Services Administration on the reimbursement costs of travel and use of photovoltaic energy in public buildings.

The bill eliminates various National Archives and Records Administration and Office of Management and Budget reports.

The bill reduces the frequency of U.S. Digital Service reports to Congress.</summary>
