This bill requires the President to develop a plan to maintain and restore the U.S. economy in response to a cyberattack or other significant event that is natural or human-caused that results in severe degradation to economic activity.

Among other requirements, this plan shall (1) examine the distribution of goods and services across the United States necessary for the reliable functioning of the country during such an event; (2) identify the economic functions of relevant actors whose disruption, corruption, or dysfunction would have a debilitating effect on security, defense readiness, or public health or safety; and (3) identify the critical distribution mechanisms for each economic sector that should be prioritized for operation during such an event.</summary>
