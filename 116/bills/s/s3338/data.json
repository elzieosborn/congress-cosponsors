    "text": "Two-Generation Economic Empowerment Act of 2020\n\nThis bill establishes the Interagency Council on Multigenerational Poverty and Economic Mobility to carry out specified objectives and the 2-generation approach (i.e., breaking the cycle of multigenerational poverty by improving family economic security through the implementation of 2-generation pilot programs that create opportunities for, and address the needs of, parents and children together). Among other activities, the council must (1) submit a national strategic plan to end and prevent multigenerational poverty and create a cycle of family prosperity; (2) provide guidance for implementing 2-generation approaches; and (3) establish certain 2-generation programs, including a 2-generation performance partnership pilot program.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget shall designate lead agencies for purposes of carrying out the 2-generation programs. A lead agency may award up to five performance partnership pilots that allow state, tribal, or local governments to combine discretionary federal funds across multiple federal programs in order to achieve certain outcomes. The Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report on these partnership pilots."
