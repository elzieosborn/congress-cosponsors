This bill provides for sanctions against foreign persons responsible for conflict-related acts of sexual and gender-based violence.

The President may impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on foreign persons responsible for sexual and gender-based violence against individuals seeking human rights or attempting to expose illegal activity by government officials.

Foreign government officials and their immediate family members who have been involved in significant corruption involving sexual or gender-based violence shall be ineligible to enter the United States.

The bill also expands existing foreign-assistance-related reporting requirements to include information on conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence.</summary>
