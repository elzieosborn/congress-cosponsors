Additionally, employers must provide short-duration breaks to employees who have a documented medical condition and allow restroom breaks to their employees for every four-hour work period.\n\nThe requirements of this bill shall not supercede any provision in a collective bargaining agreement. The bill further provides legal or equitable relief for violations of its requirements."
