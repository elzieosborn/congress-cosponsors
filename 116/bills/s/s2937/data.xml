This bill requires employers to compensate their employees for their meal, medical, and restroom breaks. Specifically, employers must compensate at prescribed rates employees who work a six-hour period for a 30-minute break to consume a meal. Additionally, employers must provide short-duration breaks to employees who have a documented medical condition and allow restroom breaks to their employees for every four-hour work period.

The requirements of this bill shall not supercede any provision in a collective bargaining agreement. The bill further provides legal or equitable relief for violations of its requirements.</summary>
