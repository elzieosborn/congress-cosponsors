This bill requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to study access by underserved populations to general surgeons, including (1) whether the health professional shortage area designation under the National Health Service Corps program accurately assesses adequacy of access, (2) whether another measure would be more accurate, and (3) potential methodologies for designating general surgery shortage areas.

HRSA must publish data comparing the availability and need of general surgery services in urban, suburban, and rural areas.

HRSA may establish a methodology for designating general surgery shortage areas and make such designations. HRSA must publish a list of general surgery shortage areas.</summary>
