Specifically, it requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to notify the Internal Revenue Service of any individual who receives a nonimmigrant visa during the eligibility period for recovery rebates. DHS must deny visas to any resident aliens who fail to repay a recovery rebate for which they are ineligible."
