  <summary date="2020-01-27T20:33:31Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill expands a Department of Justice (DOJ) program for compensating states and localities for costs related to the incarceration of certain aliens.

Currently, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) requires DOJ to compensate state and localities for the costs for incarcerating an undocumented criminal alien. The bill expands SCAAP to require DOJ to provide compensation for incarcerating aliens whose immigration status cannot be definitively identified.

The bill also expands the definition of an "undocumented criminal alien" to include qualifying aliens who were charged with a felony or two misdemeanors, where the statute currently requires convictions of such crimes. The bill also authorizes the program through FY2024.</summary>
