This bill establishes the Broadband Development Grant Program, under which the Federal Communications Commission shall make grants of at least $75 million to states for broadband development. A state that receives such a grant must give priority to opportunity zones and unserved areas or locations and must expend at least 5% of the grant funds in a technologically neutral manner to support broadband adoption by populations that face barriers to digital equity.</summary>
