    "text": "Cracking Down on Gangs and Deporting Criminals Act of 2020\n\nThis bill provides for additional instances when the prison sentence may be increased by up to ten years for an individual involved in a criminal street gang and is convicted of certain crimes, and contains other related provisions.\n\nCurrently, the increased prison sentence applies to certain offenses related to (1) controlled substances, (2) violence involving physical force, or (3) human trafficking or sexual abuse. The bill establishes that certain offenses related to deriving income from or participating in a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt shall also be eligible for the sentence increase.\n\nThe bill also expands the circumstances in which an individual may be considered to be involved in a criminal street gang and thus be eligible for the sentence increase.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) shall establish and maintain a national criminal street gang database. If an individual who is convicted and eligible for such a sentence enhancement is an alien, DOJ shall report the sentence enhancement to the Department of Homeland Security and the individual shall be subject to removal proceedings."
