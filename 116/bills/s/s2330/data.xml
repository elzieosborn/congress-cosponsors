  <summary date="2020-11-09T13:56:33Z" status="Public Law">Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020

This bill establishes safeguards to protect amateur athletes from abuse, including sexual abuse, by coaches and employees in U.S. Olympic and Paralympic sports.

The bill establishes (1) legislative mechanisms by which Congress can dissolve the Board of Directors of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and decertify national governing bodies; and (2) a duty of care that USOPC owes to amateur athletes, including protecting athletes by requiring it to ensure that any allegation of child abuse of an amateur athlete who is a minor is immediately reported to law enforcement.

The bill provides for an annual amateur athlete survey conducted anonymously and an Athletes' Advisory Council.

The bill revises duties of the Office of the Ombuds regarding the pursuit of abuse claims by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, confidentiality, and retaliation against an employee or member for disclosing information or seeking assistance in mediation. The USOPC and the national governing bodies shall not interfere in or attempt to influence the outcome of an investigation.

The center shall report to Congress within 72 hours of an attempt to interfere in, or influence the outcome of, an investigation.

The bill establishes within the legislative branch the Commission on the State of U.S. Olympics and Paralympics to study matters relating to the state of U.S. participation in the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The bill prohibits retaliation against protected individuals (including amateur athletes, coaches, and trainers) because of disclosures pertaining to sexual abuse or harassment.</summary>
