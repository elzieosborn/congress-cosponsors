This bill provides for unemployment benefits to workers affected by the coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19).

In any major disaster emergency declared by the President related to the coronavirus, the President may provide assistance for unemployment and lost wages, including by expanding the eligibility for assistance.

An individual in an area for which such a declaration is declared shall be eligible for unemployment assistance if he or she

 has experienced a week of unemployment in such area as a result of the coronavirus; has good cause to voluntarily reduce regular work hours or refuse a bona fide offer of employment, or, in the case of an unemployed self-employed individual, refuses to resume or commence suitable self-employment, for a reason such as illness or incapacity, family crises, or changed individual or family circumstances in the area, as a result of the coronavirus; or is unable to work due to the immediate federal, state, tribal, or local government response to the coronavirus. The assistance authorized for a week of unemployment shall be not less than the weekly amount authorized under the unemployment compensation law of the state for which the disaster declaration was issued.

The state unemployment compensation requirement that an individual be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work shall not apply. Compensation shall be made to an individual otherwise eligible without any waiting period.</summary>
