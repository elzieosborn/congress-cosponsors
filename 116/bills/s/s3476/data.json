The assistance authorized for a week of unemployment shall be not less than the weekly amount authorized under the unemployment compensation law of the state for which the disaster declaration was issued.\n\nThe state unemployment compensation requirement that an individual be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work shall not apply. Compensation shall be made to an individual otherwise eligible without any waiting period."
