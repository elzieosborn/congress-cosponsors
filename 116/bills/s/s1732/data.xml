This bill disallows tax deductions for certain charitable contributions made to an institution of higher education, or associated entity, within a specified period during which a specified family member (e.g. child or grandchild) attends that educational institution.

Specifically, the bill prohibits deductions for certain contributions to universities that do not have policies in place that prohibit as a factor in admissions decisions the consideration of direct or indirect donations from an applicant or family member of an applicant, and the financial ability of an applicant or family member of an applicant to make a donation.</summary>
