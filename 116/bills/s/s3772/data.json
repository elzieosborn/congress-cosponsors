These facilities include nursing homes and senior living communities.\n\nIn addition, HHS must develop, within ten days and in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a plan to enhance COVID-19 testing for older adults. The plan must include, among other topics, recommendations to address access and capacity challenges related to such testing."
