This bill modifies allocations of certain COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) relief funding for, and requires a plan focused on, COVID-19 testing of older adults.

Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must allocate a minimum level of funding to health care providers and facilities that serve significant populations of individuals aged 65 and older for expenses related to COVID-19 testing. These facilities include nursing homes and senior living communities.

In addition, HHS must develop, within ten days and in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a plan to enhance COVID-19 testing for older adults. The plan must include, among other topics, recommendations to address access and capacity challenges related to such testing.</summary>
