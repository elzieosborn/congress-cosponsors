        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>Fast Track To and Through College Act</b></p> <p>This bill provides grants for the establishment of fast track pathways that enable students to earn up to one year of college credits while still in high school.</p> <p>Grant recipients (i.e., certain partnerships that include states' educational agencies) shall use awarded funds to support statewide implementation of early college fast track pathways and early high school graduation fast track pathways. Early college fast track pathways are programs of advanced coursework resulting in credit that (1) is equivalent to two semesters of full-time postsecondary enrollment, and (2) satisfies the requirements for a high school diploma. Early high school graduation fast track pathways are scholarships for students who graduate high school early, do not require remedial coursework in postsecondary education, and attend a public two- or four-year institution of higher education.</p> <p>A grant recipient may also use grant funds to offer scholarships to students who graduate high school early, provide training or professional development for faculty who teach courses in an early college fast track pathway, or provide students with transportation to and from advanced courses in an early college fast track pathway.</p> <p>The bill also makes certain high school students participating in an early college fast track pathway eligible to receive Pell Grants.</p>]]></text>
