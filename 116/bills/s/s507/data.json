States may not use the failure of a registered individual to vote or respond to a notice as the basis for initiating the removal of the individual from the voting rolls due to a change of address.\n\nThe bill revises the voting procedure for a voter who failed to report a change of address. Such a voter who moved within a state must be allowed to vote at the polling place of the voter's current address or at a central location in the jurisdiction of the local voter registration office."
