Applicable personally identifiable\u00a0information includes, but is not limited to, precise geolocation data, long-lasting digital identifiers of individuals, and personal health information. However, such\u00a0information does not include data\u00a0that is de-identified, related to employee health screening for on-site entry, or publicly available.\n\nCovered entities, which include businesses, common carriers, and certain\u00a0nonprofit organizations,\u00a0also must provide a mechanism for individuals to revoke prior affirmative consent."
