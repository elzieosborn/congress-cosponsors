Treasury must also provide additional information in every fifth year on the impacts and outcomes of a designation of a census tract as a qualified opportunity zone using specified economic indicators.\n\nTreasury must also\u00a0establish procedures to protect against disclosure of return information that can be associated with any particular taxpayer or competitive or proprietary information."
