This bill removes restrictions on the President's power to remove upper-level executive branch officers.

Specifically, the bill (1) eliminates existing for-cause removal protections for principal officers (officers required to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate), and (2) limits the creation of future removal restrictions by requiring Congress to expressly establish such restrictions by statute.

The bill provides that a federal statute that vests discretionary decision-making authority in an executive branch officer other than the President, or that designates an agency to be an independent agency or an independent establishment, shall not be construed as a limitation on the President's power to supervise and direct the exercise of such authority.</summary>
