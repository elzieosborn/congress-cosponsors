This bill addresses the advancement of domestic refining of rare earth elements and the safe storage of thorium.

The Department of Commerce must establish a privately funded, operated, and managed Thorium-Bearing Rare Earth Refinery Cooperative tasked with the creation of a fully integrated domestic rare earth value chain to serve U.S. national security needs and the critical advanced manufacturing industries.

The Department of Energy must coordinate with other agencies to procure the issuance of a federal charter for the Thorium Storage, Energy, and Industrial Products Corporation which shall assume liability for and ownership of all thorium and mineralogically actinides and decay products contained within the rare earth element ores utilized by the cooperative.</summary>
