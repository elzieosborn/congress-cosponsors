Specifically, the bill allows a income tax credit for 40% of the sum of wages paid in a medical product manufacturing economically distressed zone, employee fringe benefit expenses, and depreciation and amortization allowances with respect to qualified medical product manufacturing facility property, and a credit for economically distressed zone products and services acquired by domestic medical product manufacturers..\n\nThe bill also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to study the extent to which the health of aging individuals and vulnerable populations have been disproportionately harmed by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and prior epidemics and pandemics."
