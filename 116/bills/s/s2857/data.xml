This bill designates certain educational assistance funds as federal educational assistance for the purpose of determining a for-profit institution's revenue sources.

Under current law, a for-profit institution must receive at least 10% of its revenue from non-federal sources (known as the 90/10 Rule). Certain federal educational assistance funds provided to students who are servicemembers or veterans are not currently counted as federal sources, which enables a for-profit institution to count those funds towards its 10% requirement.

This bill designates such educational assistance funds as federal educational assistance, prohibiting a for-profit institution from counting such funds towards its 10% requirement. In addition, the bill establishes a tiered system of penalties for a school that violates the 90/10 Rule, but it also provides an appeal process that allows a for-profit institution to seek temporary relief from such penalties upon a showing that it meets certain conditions (e.g., offering high-quality academic or job-training programs and placing veterans and servicemembers in jobs after graduation).

The bill also requires disclosure&#8212;on the Department of Education's College Navigator website and the Department of Veterans Affairs' GI Bill Comparison Tool website&#8212;of any for-profit institution that is not in compliance, as well as the applicable sanction on such institution.

Lastly, any for-profit institution that converts to nonprofit status shall be subject to the 90/10 Rule for the two-year period after the date of conversion.</summary>
