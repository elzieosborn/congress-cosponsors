    "text": "Inclusive Aging Act\n\nThis bill includes an older individual's status as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) within the scope of greatest social needs and makes other changes to the functions of the Administration on Aging (AOA), grant programs, and other activities concerning older LGBT individuals. Under current law, certain programs and services for older Americans must target those with the greatest economic and social needs.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes the Office of Inclusivity and Sexual Health within the AOA and reestablishes the National Resource Center on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Aging to provide resources and other support pertaining to services for older LGBT individuals. The AOA must also report on the effectiveness of, and conduct data collection and studies on, services for older LGBT individuals.\n\nWith respect to grant programs, the bill establishes a program for states, tribes, and others to provide education and resources for sexual health and other services for older LGBT individuals in rural areas. It also expands eligibility for other grants to include, for example, organizations that serve LGBT individuals and broadens the scope of certain grant-funded activities specifically focused on families and caregivers to include individuals with the greatest social needs.\n\nIn addition, state long-term care ombudsmen must collect, and report on, data relating to discrimination of, and need for sexual health services by, older LGBT individuals and those in a protected class."
