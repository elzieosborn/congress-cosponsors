This bill permanently reauthorizes, and expands, the Indian Reservation Drinking Water Program.

Specifically, the bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency to connect, expand, or repair existing public water systems that are on Indian reservations or off-reservation sites that serve tribes in the Columbia River Basin or its adjacent coastal river basins. Currently, only projects that are on Indian reservations in the Upper Missouri River Basin or the Upper Rio Grande Basin are eligible for the program.</summary>
