A court may use a pseudonym to protect a depicted individual's confidentiality when granting an injunction.\n\nEvidence that a depicted individual consented to the capturing of the intimate image shall not by itself constitute consent for disclosure of the image. Similarly, evidence that a depicted individual provided an intimate image to a person shall not by itself constitute consent to further disclosure of that image."
