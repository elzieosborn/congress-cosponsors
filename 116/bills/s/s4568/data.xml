This bill establishes various entities to develop and distribute forensic science standards.

The Office of Science and Technology Policy shall establish an interagency working group to develop a research strategy for forensic science and publish such strategy once every two years.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) shall establish the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science to facilitate the development of forensic science standards. NIST shall establish scientific area committees to carry out the work of the organization and a Forensic Science Standards Board to oversee the operation of the organization and its committees.

NIST shall conduct foundational studies to (1) identify and document the technical merit and validity of select forensic science methods, practices, and disciplines; and (2) identify opportunities for advancements in forensic methods, practices, and disciplines through additional research and improvements to practice.</summary>
