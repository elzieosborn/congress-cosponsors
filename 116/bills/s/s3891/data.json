    "text": "Advancing Artificial Intelligence Research Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires the development of standards for artificial intelligence and establishes the National Program to Advance Artificial Intelligence Research.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) shall have the mission, among other things, of advancing frameworks, standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for artificial intelligence. NIST shall also participate in the development of standards and specifications for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe bill provides for a research program with a national scope to advance use-inspired artificial intelligence research and its use to serve the needs of the United States, NIST, and specified stakeholders.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) shall establish at least six National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes to serve the needs of the United States and other specified stakeholders by (1) conducting research on longer-time-horizon challenges in artificial intelligence research, and (2) creating and developing processes to advance use-inspired artificial intelligence research and its deployment.\n\nThe NSF shall award grants to establish traineeship programs and support trainees in topics of national importance selected by the NSF, including the selection of artificial intelligence as the initial topic.\n\nThe NSF shall establish a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of awarding grants to conduct research in rapidly evolving, high priority topics (i.e, of high importance to the economy and security of the United States). It shall select artificial intelligence as the initial topic for the pilot program."
