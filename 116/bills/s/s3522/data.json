Specifically, states may\u00a0(1) allow certain families that have incomes of up to 400% of the federal poverty level and that have experienced\u00a0reduced incomes because of COVID-19 to receive TANF assistance, and (2) provide additional cash payments to these and other TANF recipients.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must increase state and tribal TANF grants to offset increased expenditures that result from these changes. The bill\u00a0provides appropriations for this purpose.\n\nThe bill also suspends TANF work requirements and other conditions during the emergency."
