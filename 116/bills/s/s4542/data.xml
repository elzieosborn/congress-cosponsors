  <summary date="2020-10-21T19:24:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">America First Vaccine Act 

This bill prohibits a U.S.-headquartered manufacturer of a COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine that was developed with federal pandemic relief funding from distributing it outside of the United States, unless the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) certifies that domestic need for the vaccine already has been met.

However, HHS may waive the certification requirement and permit distribution outside of the United States if HHS makes a determination that such distribution would be in the interest of U.S. public health.

A manufacturer that violates the requirement must reimburse the federal government for all amounts received by the manufacturer in support of development of the vaccine, plus interest.</summary>
