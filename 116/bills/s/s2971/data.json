    "text": "CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2019 The bill revises and reauthorizes through FY2026 state and community-based child abuse and prevention grants programs. Specifically, the bill directs the Children\u2019s Bureau of the Office of the Administration of Children and Families and state-level child protective service systems to use state grants to support (1) interagency coordination; (2) evidence-informed best practices; (3) services for underserved or overrepresented populations, including abandoned youth, victims of sexual abuse and exploitation, and unaccompanied homeless youth; and (4) addressing the link between child abuse and domestic violence, among other purposes.\n\nThe bill also revises various reporting requirements, including requiring states to provide more detailed information about the number and circumstances of child deaths that result from abuse and neglect. The bill further modifies the community-based grants program, through which a designated lead agency coordinates resources and develops continuity of care. Specifically, the lead agency must select local programs to support based on such program\u2019s ability to (1) provide broad and comprehensive services, (2) involve parents, and (3) increase access to community-based and prevention-based services to underserved and overrepresented populations.\n\nSuch community-based grants also are revised to permit using funds for (1) assessments of community needs, (2) connecting individuals and families to nutrition programs; (3) referrals to workforce development programs; and (4) developing and maintaining kinship caregiver relationships, among other uses."
