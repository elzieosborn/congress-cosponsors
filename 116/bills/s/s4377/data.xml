  <summary date="2020-09-16T15:33:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Protect our Children from COVID-19 Act

This bill requires the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in coordination with relevant federal and nonfederal experts, to support research on the role of children in transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

This research must address, among other topics, the transmissibility of the virus among children and adults and the vulnerability of children to COVID-19 while travelling to and from school, playing sports, and engaging in other extramural activities. It may also address the vulnerability to COVID-19 of adults who live with children and the types of personal protective equipment appropriate for students, teachers, and other staff in school buildings. In undertaking this research, the NIH must ensure that it takes into consideration certain demographic and other characteristics, such as&#160;race or ethnicity and health or economic status.

The NIH must, within six months,&#160;report findings on this research and disseminate best practices for protecting those in educational settings. The NIH must&#160;update its findings and best practices quarterly through the end of the declared COVID-19 emergency.</summary>
