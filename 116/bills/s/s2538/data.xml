This bill repeals the requirement that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopt a standard unique health identifier for each individual, employer, health plan, and health care provider.

Historically, language has been included in annual appropriations bills for HHS that prohibits the use of federal funds related to the development of a unique individual identifier. In 2019, however, an appropriations bill passed the House of Representatives without such a prohibition.</summary>
