    "text": "America's Conservation Enhancement Act This bill reauthorizes or establishes several programs that conserve or manage wildlife. TITLE I--WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT, DISEASE, AND PREDATION (Sec. 101) This section establishes a Theodore Roosevelt Genius Prize, under which at least one cash prize is awarded annually for technological innovation for reducing the frequency of human-predator conflict using nonlethal means. (Sec. 102) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must establish a program to award grants to states and Indian tribes. The grants must be used to assist livestock producers in carrying out proactive and nonlethal activities to reduce the risk of livestock loss due to depredation by federally protected species (e.g., endangered species) and related research activities. Grants may also be used to compensate livestock producers for such losses. (Sec. 103) The USFWS may issue depredation permits to livestock producers authorizing takings (e.g., capturing or killing) of black vultures or common ravens otherwise prohibited by federal law to prevent such vultures or ravens from taking livestock during the calving season or lambing season. However, permits may be issued only to livestock producers in states and regions affected or that have been affected in the prior year by such vultures or ravens.\n\n(Sec. 104) APHIS, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the USFWS must enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to study the predominant pathways and mechanisms of the transmission of chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, and farmed populations of deer, elk, reindeer, and moose in the United States.\n\nAPHIS, the USGS, and the USFWS must then jointly establish within the USFWS a Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force. The section outlines the task force's duties, including the duty to develop an interstate action plan to stop the spread of and mitigate the impacts of chronic wasting disease. (Sec. 105) This section revises requirements under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act concerning federal strategic plans to reduce invasive species populations in land or water managed by specified federal agencies. Specifically, the section directs agencies tasked with developing strategic plans for the implementation of their invasive species programs to consult with stakeholders and coordinate with other federal agencies. (Sec. 106) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 the North American Wetlands Conservation Act. (Sec. 107) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 and revises the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, including requirements concerning the foundation's board.(Sec. 108) This section prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating the lead content of sport fishing equipment under the Toxic Substances Control Act.\n\n(Sec. 109) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n\n(Sec. 110) This section reauthorizes through FY2025 the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network and the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Grants Assistance Program.\n\n(Sec. 111) The USFWS must establish the Chesapeake Watershed Investments for Landscape Defense program to (1) identify, prioritize, and implement restoration and protection activities within the watershed; (2) adopt a Chesapeake Bay watershed-wide strategy that supports the implementation of a shared set of science-based restoration and protection activities; and (3) establish a grant program to provide funding and technical assistance for restoration and protection activities.\n\nTITLE II--NATIONAL FISH HABITAT CONSERVATION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS\n\n(Sec. 203) This section creates the National Fish Habitat Board to establish national goals and priorities for fish habitat conservation and makes recommendations regarding fish habitat conservation projects.\n\n(Sec. 204) The board may recommend to Congress the designation of Fish Habitat Partnerships based on the criteria outlined in this section. Any existing partnership must obtain congressional designation within five years in order to receive federal funds. (Sec. 205) Each designated partnership must submit to the board a list of priority fish habitat conservation projects recommended for annual funding. The board must submit to the Department of the Interior a list of projects based on the criteria outlined in this section. Interior must approve or reject projects within 90 days of receipt of the list. (Sec. 206) Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the EPA, and the USGS may provide scientific and technical assistance to partnerships, participants in fish habitat conservation projects, and the board. (Sec. 207) Interior must coordinate with states and Indian tribes on project activities within their boundaries. (Sec. 208) Interior must develop an interagency operational plan concerning the implementation of this title. (Sec. 212) Interior may accept donations of funds, property, and services to carry out this title.\n\nTITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n(Sec. 301) The Department of Agriculture, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the USFWS must conduct a study about factors affecting successful conservation activities taken to protect and conserve a threatened or endangered species. The agencies must then publish the results of the study.\n\n(Sec. 302) This section establishes reporting requirements concerning amounts expended or disbursed by federal departments and agencies as a direct result of any provision of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\n(Sec. 303) This section allows any institution eligible to receive federal funds under the Agriculture Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 to use the value of any land owned by the institution as an in-kind match to satisfy any cost-sharing requirement under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act."
