This bill makes changes to the Peace Corps.

The bill changes the Peace Corps from an independent agency that reports to the President to a subordinate agency within the Department of State.

The Peace Corps shall also terminate any programs in China. The Peace Corps may not operate in any country that the State Department deems hostile to U.S. national security interests.

The State Department shall annually report to Congress on Peace Corps programs around the world, including how each program furthers U.S. interests and is not contrary to U.S. national security.</summary>
