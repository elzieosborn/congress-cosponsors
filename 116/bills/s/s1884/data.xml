  <summary date="2019-07-16T19:55:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Start Advancing Firearms Enhancements and Technology Act of 2019 or the SAFETY Act 

This bill increases the rate of the research tax credit from 20% to 30% for research expenses to develop smart gun technologies. The bill also modifies the excise tax on the sale of firearms to exempt the portion of the sale price that is attributable to smart gun technology.

"Smart gun technology" is technology (other than a simple mechanical lock) that is designed to (1) prevent a firearm from being fired by any individual other than an authorized user; and (2) convert the firearm from the inoperable condition to the operable condition in less than two seconds after the authorized user makes contact with the firearm, the firearm's arming device, or an external safe or locking device.</summary>
