In addition, the bill provides certain authorities to health care professional regulatory bodies, such as medical boards, to investigate and take disciplinary actions against a professional who provides telehealth services to a patient in that organization's jurisdiction pursuant to this bill.\n\nThe bill also permits the Department of Health and Human Services to similarly expand the authority of health care professionals to provide these services in the event of future major disasters or emergencies."
