The bill defines marginalized youth as a person under the age of 26 who is disadvantaged by underlying structural barriers and social inequity. \n\nGrants may be used to (1) provide sexual health information to marginalized youth, (2) promote effective communication regarding sexual health among marginalized youth, (3) promote and support opportunities for school-age parents, and (4) train individuals who work with marginalized youth to promote sexual health and the development of safe and supportive environments.\n\nGrants may not be used to provide access to health services that (1) are medically unsound; (2) withhold sexual health-promoting or lifesaving information; (3) promote gender stereotypes; or (4) are insensitive or unresponsive to the needs of young people, including youth with varying gender identities and sexual orientations, sexually active youth, pregnant or parenting youth, and survivors of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nUnobligated funds for abstinence education are transferred and made available for these grants."
