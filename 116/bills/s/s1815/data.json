    "text": "Farmworker Smoke Protection Act of 2019\n\nThis bill requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to address the exposure of farmworkers to wildfire smoke.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes an initial occupational safety and health standard to\u00a0protect farmworkers from wildfire smoke. The initial standard\u00a0must require employers to\u00a0provide farmworkers with (1)\u00a0appropriate equipment (e.g., N95 mask or N100 masks)\u00a0to protect them when they are\u00a0exposed to wildfire smoke that reaches a certain level of air pollution, and (2)\u00a0training and education materials\u00a0about how to use the equipment and the potential health impacts of breathing smoke without protective equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Under the standard, workers are required to use the equipment when the air pollution reaches a specified level.\n\nOSHA must promulgate an occupational safety and health standard that provides at least the same level of protection as the initial standard.\n\nUpon request,\u00a0OSHA must provide technical assistance to employers on how to comply with the standards. OSHA must also develop sample training and education materials that may be used by employers."
