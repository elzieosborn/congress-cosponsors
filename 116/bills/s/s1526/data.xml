  <summary date="2020-01-27T22:07:41Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Prevention of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces Act

This bill addresses sexual assault in the armed forces. It directs the Department of Defense to establish a Defense Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct.

Upon a determination not to refer a case of alleged sexual assault for trial by court-martial, the commander making such determination shall notify the victim, at least monthly, of the status of further action.

The bill also allows each military department to detail certain enlisted members meeting requirements for acceptance of a commission as commissioned officers as students at accredited U.S. law schools for a period of legal training leading to a law degree. A service member agreeing to such training will, upon completion, accept a commission as a judge advocate or law specialist. Selections shall be on a competitive basis for active duty for a two-year period (in addition to any other service obligation).</summary>
