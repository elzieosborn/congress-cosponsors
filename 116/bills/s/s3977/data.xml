  <summary date="2020-07-28T23:58:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Cut Profits to the Cuban Regime Act of 2020

This bill requires the Department of State to publish a list of countries that contract with&#160;Cuba's medical missions program and to consider, when determining a country's ranking for the annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, whether the country participated in programs with foreign organizations that enable human trafficking.

Cuba's overseas medical missions program employs health care&#160;professionals in more than 60 countries but has been included in the annual TIP Report for indicators of human trafficking in the program.</summary>
