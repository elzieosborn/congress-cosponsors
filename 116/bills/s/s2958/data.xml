  <summary date="2021-09-13T17:34:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expanded Food Safety Investigation Act of 2019

This bill provides that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may, under specified circumstances,&#160;request access to a concentrated animal-feeding operation (i.e., a stabled or confined animal-feeding operation) to conduct microbial sampling.

Specifically, the bill allows the FDA to request access if the FDA determines that sampling is necessary to facilitate an investigation of a foodborne-illness outbreak, determine the cause of the outbreak, or address other public health needs.

The bill provides that such an operation shall be subject to penalties for refusing such a sampling.</summary>
