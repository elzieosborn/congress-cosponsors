This bill authorizes the Department of Labor to make available the following amounts for youth employment programs:

 up to $1.5 billion to provide youth ages 14-24 with subsidized summer employment opportunities, and up to $2 billion to provide them with subsidized year-round employment opportunities. Labor must award (1) one-year planning and three-year implementation grants out of the subsidized summer employment opportunities funding, and (2) similar grants out of the subsidized year-round employment opportunities funding.

To be eligible to receive these grants, an entity must be a state, local government, Indian tribe or tribal organization, or community-based organization that meets certain partnership requirements of this bill.

Labor shall establish performance measures to carry out annual reviews of each grant recipient.</summary>
