    "text": "Internet Development for Tribes Act of 2020\n\nThis bill establishes requirements to assist tribal entities with access to spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band.\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may not (1) impose a build-out or performance requirement on certain tribal entities that hold licenses for spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band, or (2) cancel or terminate a license if the licensee fails to meet any construction or performance benchmark.\n\nThe FCC must, upon request, provide technical assistance and guidance on the most effective use of the 2.5 GHz band for wireless and broadband services. Further, the FCC must award grants to these license holders for technical assistance and acquisition of appropriate equipment and services related to the use of the 2.5 GHz band, respectively.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must determine whether the federal government possesses surplus equipment that can be used to access the 2.5 GHz band. If surplus equipment is found, each federal agency possessing surplus must transfer it to the FCC for distribution to tribal license holders to aid in their deployment of broadband service."
