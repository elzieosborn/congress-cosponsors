Specifically, no agency may require a person to comply with this standard with respect to a fiscal year beginning before December 31, 2024.\n\nAdditionally, the community bank leverage ratio is set at 8% for community banks seeking to satisfy simplified capital adequacy requirements. Currently, banking agencies are required to set the rate between 8% and 10% through rulemaking."
