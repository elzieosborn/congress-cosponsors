Such plan must be tailored to achieve specific objectives, including\n\n enhancement of the response and resiliency of computer networks, industrial control systems, and communications systems against cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities; implementation of continuous vulnerability assessments and threat mitigation practices; adoption of cybersecurity best practices by entities performing cybersecurity functions within a state; and confirmation that continuity of communications and data networks would be maintained in the event of a catastrophic disruption of such communications or networks."
