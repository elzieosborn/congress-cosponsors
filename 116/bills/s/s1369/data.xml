  <summary date="2020-03-02T15:33:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act of 2019

This bill requires the President to (1) impose financial sanctions on, and prohibit U.S. entry by,&#160;nationals of Vietnam who are complicit in human rights abuses committed against nationals of Vietnam or their family members, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in Vietnam; and (2) submit to Congress a publicly available list of individuals determined to be complicit in such human rights abuses.

The President may waive sanctions to comply with international agreements or if in the U.S. national interest.

Sanctions shall be terminated if the President certifies to Congress that the government of Vietnam has (1) released all political prisoners; (2) ceased using violence, detention, and abuse against Vietnamese nationals engaging in peaceful political activity; and (3) conducted a transparent investigation into the killings, arrest, and abuse of such political activists and prosecuted those responsible.</summary>
