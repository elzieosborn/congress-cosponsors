This bill modifies label requirements for meat food products of cattle.

Specifically, the bill prohibits the label of cattle meat or a meat food product of cattle from bearing the phrase Product of U.S.A. unless such meat or meat food product is exclusively derived from one or more cattle born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States.

The requirement does not apply to cattle meat or a meat food product of cattle that is intended and offered for export to a foreign country.</summary>
