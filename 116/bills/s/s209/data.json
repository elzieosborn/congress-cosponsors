Under the program, Native American tribes or organizations may receive grants to plan for participation in self-governance and to negotiate the terms of participation.\n\nIn addition, the bill revises the Department of the Interior's process for approving self-governance compacts and funding agreements with tribes. Interior must negotiate contracts and funding agreements to maximize implementation of the self-governance policy. The bill sets forth requirements for tribes participating in self-governance with respect to conflicts of interest, audits, redesign and consolidation of programs, retrocession of programs, non-duplication\u00a0of funding, and records.\n\nFunding agreements must include provisions for Interior to monitor the performance of trust functions by the tribe and to reassume a program and funding under specified circumstances.\n\nTribes participating in self-governance may elect to assume some federal responsibilities with respect to certain construction projects.\n\nThe bill prohibits\u00a0obligating a tribe\u00a0to continue performance of a compact or funding agreement that provides insufficient funding."
