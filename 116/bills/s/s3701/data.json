    "text": "Supporting Connectivity for Higher Education Students in Need Act\n\nThis bill establishes and provides funds for the Emergency Higher Education Connectivity Fund. Specifically, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) must use the fund to support institutions of higher education (IHEs) in providing broadband internet access service, videoconferencing systems and services used for distance learning, and equipment (e.g., computers, Wi-Fi hotspots, and other one-time costs) to enrolled students during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.\n\nThe bill requires the NTIA, in consultation with the Department of Education, to promulgate regulations within 14 days related to support for IHEs.\n\nAmong other things, the regulations must\n\n prioritize support for IHEs that receive certain institutional grants, including historically Black colleges and universities, minority-serving institutions, and rural-serving institutions; require IHEs to prioritize support for students who are eligible for need-based financial aid; and establish a schedule of reasonable per-student funding amounts for eligible services and equipment."
