The program provides capital, planning, and operating assistance to states to support public transportation in rural areas with populations of less than 50,000.\n\nTo qualify for the increased federal share, a project must serve an area that is\n\n an area of persistent poverty (a county in which at least 20% of the population has lived in poverty during the most recent 30-year period); a county in which at least 25% of residents are age 65 or older, a county designated as a health professional shortage area on the basis of a primary care or mental health care shortage, or a county with low population density of not more than 20 people per square mile of land area."
