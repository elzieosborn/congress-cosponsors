This bill requires certain manufacturers of drugs that are covered under Medicare medical services to report pricing information to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Specifically, manufacturers of such drugs that do not have rebate agreements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must report similar information as is required under the program, including average sales price, total units, and wholesale acquisition cost. Manufacturers that fail to comply or that report false information are subject to civil penalties.</summary>
