This bill expands financial assistance for, and establishes measures to support, the creative economy and art entrepreneurs.

Specifically, the bill requires (1) the Small Business Administration to develop loan criteria, evaluation procedures, and technical assistance programs for small business concerns that are owned by artists and support the creative economy, (2) the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture to ensure that traditional economic development tools, such as business incubators and grant programs, support the arts industry and creative economy, and (3) the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure that expenses incurred by a self-employed worker to repair or replace needed tools because of a major disaster are eligible for disaster assistance.

Further, the recipient of a national service program grant is authorized to carry out the program through an Artist Corps that identifies and meets unmet needs in communities through artistic activities.

The bill also requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assist activities that support creative placemaking through community development mechanisms and partnerships between local governments and nonprofit cultural organizations.

Commerce shall establish a demonstration program to promote creative and performing arts in the economic planning of local governments.

Finally, the Department of Homeland Security must adjudicate petitions for nonimmigrant visas for aliens with extraordinary ability or achievement, and artists and entertainers, within 14 days after receiving them.</summary>
