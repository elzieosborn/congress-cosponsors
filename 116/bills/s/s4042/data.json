    "text": "Frontline At-Risk Manual Laborers Protection Act or the FARM Laborers Protection Act This bill requires agricultural employers that receive federal agricultural-specific funding related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) to provide employees with emergency paid sick leave and specified premium pay through 90 days after the date on which the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. Specifically, during such period, such agricultural employers must provide paid sick time to employees who are unable to work due to the effects of COVID-19. Full-time employees are entitled to 80 hours of such leave and part-time employees are entitled to such leave in the amount of the average number of hours the employee works during an average two-week period. Under current law, employers of fewer than 50 employees may be exempt from these emergency paid sick leave requirements. The bill also requires such agricultural employers to provide premium pay of $13 per hour up to a maximum of $10,000 per employee, or a maximum of $5,000 for employees who earn $100,000 or more per year, during the public health emergency and 90 days thereafter. The Department of Labor must provide grants for agricultural employers to meet these premium pay requirements. Labor also must promulgate rules to limit the involuntary furlough or termination of applicable agricultural workers during such time period. Additionally, the bill establishes grants to agricultural employers with 50 or fewer employees to provide employees with handwashing stations, portable restrooms, and personal protective equipment that comply with guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
