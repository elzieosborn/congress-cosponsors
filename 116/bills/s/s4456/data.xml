This bill requires the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to take certain actions to standardize, in the United States Postal Service (USPS) standard, the format of postal addresses.

Specifically, the ONC must, within 90 days, make available a USPS tool that automatically formats addresses into the correct standard to health care providers and laboratories that test for COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) at no cost. The USPS currently provides this tool to online retailers at no cost.

In addition, the ONC must update regulations to require, as a condition of certification, that health information technology use the USPS standard for postal addresses.</summary>
