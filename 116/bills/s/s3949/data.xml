This bill expands the types of educational expenses that may be paid from a qualified tuition program (commonly known as a 529 plan) for students enrolled at or attending an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school. It also permits payments of certain education expenses for home schooling during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period beginning on March 13, 2020, and ending on the date the emergency period has ended.

The bill also permits penalty free distributions from tax-preferred retirement plans for the period after February 29, 2020, and before January 1, 2021, if contributed to a 529 plan.</summary>
