Such requirements apply to travel expenses incurred on or after December 31, 2019, and on or before September 30, 2020.\n\nThe State Department must (1) waive any travel expenses paid by it on or after December 31, 2019, for any U.S. citizen who is evacuated from a foreign country and repatriated to the United States due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, or any future pandemic or international crisis; (2) nullify any travel expense promissory note required for reimbursing the State Department; (3) reimburse such individuals for travel expenses associated with evacuation and repatriation, including the costs of flights and ground transportation expenses associated with travel to a foreign airport and from the domestic airport to their homes in the United States; and (4) develop an online reimbursement system for individuals to submit claims for the reimbursement of travel expenses."
