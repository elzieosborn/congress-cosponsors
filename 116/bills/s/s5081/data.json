Under current law, responsible parties are liable for the total of all removal costs plus $75 million. The bill removes the cap of $75 million on liability and makes the responsible parties liable for all covered damages. Covered damages includes damages for (1) loss of natural resources, property, revenue, or profits; or (2) costs of providing increased public services during or after removal activities, such as fire protection."
