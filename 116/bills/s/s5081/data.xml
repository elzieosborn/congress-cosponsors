This bill revises requirements governing the liability of parties that are responsible for oil discharges from offshore facilities into navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. Under current law, responsible parties are liable for the total of all removal costs plus $75 million. The bill removes the cap of $75 million on liability and makes the responsible parties liable for all covered damages. Covered damages includes damages for (1) loss of natural resources, property, revenue, or profits; or (2) costs of providing increased public services during or after removal activities, such as fire protection.</summary>
