    "text": "21st Century Community Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act of 2020\n\nThis bill expands the allowable uses for subgrants provided under the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. Additionally, the bill provides funds to subgrant recipients for specified activities and supplies.\n\nSpecifically, the bill allows eligible entities (e.g., local educational agencies and community-based organizations) that are awarded program subgrants for community learning centers to use these subgrants to carry out activities that advance student academic achievement and support student success during the regular school day when full-time in-person instruction is not available to students. Further, eligible entities may carry out these activities regardless of whether such activities are conducted in person or virtually. (Currently, the program only supports academic enrichment opportunities for children during non-school hours or periods when school is not in session.)\n\nSubgrant recipients must comply with all applicable health and safety requirements.\n\nFinally, the bill provides funds for subgrant recipients to provide additional hours of service, hire additional staff to maintain social distancing, and purchase cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment."
