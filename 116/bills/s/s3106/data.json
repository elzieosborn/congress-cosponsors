    "text": "Reforestation Act of 2019\n\nThis bill addresses the need for reforestation of National Forest System (NFS) lands following certain unplanned events, including wildfires, weather events, and infestations of insects or diseases.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to transmit to Congress annually, for 10 years, an estimate of the funds needed to replant and otherwise treat an acreage equal to the acreage to be cut over that year plus a sufficient portion of the backlog of lands in need of treatment to eliminate the backlog in the 10-year period.\n\nThe Forest Service shall create a priority list of projects that promote effective reforestation following specified unplanned events.\n\nThe bill sets 2029 as the target year for when the renewable resources of the NFS must be operating where there are no longer any backlogs and the major portion of planned intensive multiple-use sustained-yield management procedures must be installed and operating on an environmentally-sound basis.\n\nThe bill increases the amount that may be transferred to the reforestation trust fund for any fiscal year.\n\nThe land management goals of Forest Service stewardship end result contracting projects may include reforestation in accordance with the priority list.\n\nUSDA may enter into good neighbor agreements for reforestation activities in accordance with the priority list."
