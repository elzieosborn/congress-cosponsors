    "text": "PPE Innovation Act of 2020\n\nThis bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry out and expand programs for research and development of personal protective equipment, particularly with respect to equipment used by health care personnel.\n\nGenerally, the bill requires the CDC to continue the activities of the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This laboratory operates within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and conducts scientific research, develops guidance, and disseminates information concerning workplace health hazards.\n\nThe bill also specifically directs the CDC, in consultation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Food and Drug Administration, to establish a program in the laboratory to research personal protective equipment used in health care settings. In carrying out this program, the CDC must consult with health care personnel to inform research, conduct pilot tests of new equipment, and coordinate with manufacturers concerning the production of, and supply chain for, such equipment.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Health and Human Services shall enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to periodically conduct public workshops focused on research, development, and other issues concerning personal protective equipment."
