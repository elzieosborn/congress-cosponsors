The refinanced interest rate is fixed for the period of the loan.\n\nThe bill also directs the Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to carry out a campaign to notify qualified borrowers who are not in default on their loans that they are eligible to apply for refinancing under the program within a two-year period."
