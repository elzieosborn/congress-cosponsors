This bill revises and extends through FY2025 the fixed guideway capital investment grant program.

Specifically, the bill (1) increases funding for the program; (2) revises how the Department of Transportation (DOT) evaluates and rates new fixed guideway capital projects under the program based upon, among other things, a consideration of inoperability; and (3) directs DOT to report on financing and technical barriers to the construction and operation of fixed guideway transportation projects with a total estimated capital cost of not more than $500,000 in small urbanized and rural areas.</summary>
