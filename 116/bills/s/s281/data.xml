This bill provides continuing appropriations to prevent a government shutdown if any appropriations measure for a fiscal year has not been enacted before the fiscal year begins and continuing appropriations are not in effect.

 The bill provides appropriations at the rate of operations that was provided for the prior fiscal year to continue programs, projects, and activities for which funds were provided in the preceding fiscal year.

The bill also prohibits the Senate from considering matters other than appropriations or emergency legislation on or after October 1 of each fiscal year if continuing appropriations provided by this bill are in effect.</summary>
