This bill establishes and provides funding for the Microbusiness Assistance Fund through which the Department of the Treasury must provide grants to specified small entities.

Specifically, the bill provides $125 billion for grants to entities such as community small businesses and nonprofits that have suffered a drop in revenue of over 20% during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Such a grant shall not exceed $250,000 and may only be used for certain purposes, including (1) rehiring or hiring furloughed employees; (2) payment of compensation, rent or mortgage, utilities, or insurance; and (3) providing health care and benefits to employees.

Treasury is prohibited from denying a grant on the basis of any criminal history or involvement with the criminal legal system. Further, Treasury must give priority to people of color, veterans, women-owned community businesses, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and 75% of appropriated amounts shall be provided to businesses or nonprofits owned or controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</summary>
