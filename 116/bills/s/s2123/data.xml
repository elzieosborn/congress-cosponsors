This bill requires the Department of Education to develop an alternative certification program that allows students to use Pell Grants for enrollment in educational programs that have existed for at least five years and would not otherwise be eligible.

The alternative certification program may not require accreditation, state authorization, minimum instructional hours, or minimum classroom time for an educational program to be eligible.</summary>
