This bill prohibits the use of federal funds for health care services unless the entity receiving the funds certifies to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that the entity respects all human life.

Specifically, the entity must ensure that health care practitioners employed by or affiliated with the entity (1) exercise the same degree of professional skill and diligence to preserve the life and health of any patient as a conscientious health care practitioner would render to a patient in a different state of functionality, including patients in specified categories (e.g., terminally ill patients, elderly patients, and the unborn); (2) do not intentionally end the life of, or otherwise harm, any patient; and (3) do not institute a do-not-resuscitate or similar order without obtaining specified informed consent.

In addition, HHS must (1) establish a public database that indicates whether an entity is in compliance, and (2) periodically review entities to ensure compliance. The Department of Justice or a person adversely affected may bring a civil action for violations.</summary>
