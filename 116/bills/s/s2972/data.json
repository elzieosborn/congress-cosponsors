The President shall (1) place such items on the Commerce Control List (a list of items subject to export controls); and (2) require authorization for the export, reexport, or transfer of such items to or within China. The bill terminates certain prohibitions, such as a prohibition against obligating funds for U.S. Trade and Development Agency activities in China, upon a report by\u00a0the President to Congress that China has taken specified actions, including ending the mass internment of Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang."
