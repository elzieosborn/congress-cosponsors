This bill establishes certain requirements for voting by mail in federal elections, including by requiring mail-in ballots to be received by the time the polls close on election day. Further, the bill requires states to count all eligible ballots within 24 hours after the election.

In addition, the bill makes it unlawful to possess or return a mail-in ballot completed by another person (commonly referred to as ballot harvesting), with exceptions. A violator is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to one year, or both.</summary>
