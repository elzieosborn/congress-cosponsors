This bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to use the same procedures when enforcing antitrust law, and it requires the FTC to issue a decision within 180 days of receiving a merger application.

Under current law, the FTC litigates the merits of contested merger cases before its own administrative tribunals. The bill requires the FTC to litigate these cases in federal court, similar to DOJ.</summary>
