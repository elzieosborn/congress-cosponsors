This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to get a medical opinion to determine if a service-connected disability was the principal or contributory cause of death in situations where a veteran with a service-connected disability dies from COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), or complications from COVID-19, and the death certificate does not clearly identify the service-connected disability as the principal or contributory cause of death.</summary>
