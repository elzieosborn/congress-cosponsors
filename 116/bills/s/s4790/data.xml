This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to ensure that a member of the Armed Forces who is separating or retiring from service may elect to have DOD transmit their name and contact information to accredited veterans service officers based on the post-separation mailing address they provided. An accredited veterans service officer is a person who has been recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for purposes of preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims for VA benefits.</summary>
