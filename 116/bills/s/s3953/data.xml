This bill directs the Department of Defense to carry out two five-year pilot programs to

 assess the feasibility and advisability of mechanisms to reduce barriers to participation in the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps at certain historically Black colleges and universities and certain other minority institutions of higher education (covered institutions) by creating partnerships between satellite or extension Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps units at such institutions and military installations, and assess the feasibility and advisability of providing financial assistance to members of the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps and members of the Coast Guard College Student Pre-Commissioning Initiative at covered institutions for participation in flight training.</summary>
