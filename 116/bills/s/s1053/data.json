    "text": "Saving for the Future Act\n\nThis bill requires employers to make minimum contributions to savings plans for full-time employees and increases certain individual and corporate income tax rates. Specifically, it requires employers of 10 or more full-time employees to contribute 50 cents for each hour an employee works to a qualified pension plan. The minimum contribution increases to 60 cents per hour after two years and proportionally based on income beginning two years thereafter. The bill further establishes the Federal Universal Personal Savings Investment Board to oversee UP retirement and savings accounts. Applicable small employers may make contributions to such accounts directly as a qualified plan or through a state-run program. UP retirement accounts are portable, defined-contribution pension plans to which employees must contribute 4% of the employee's wages unless the employee opts out. Employers must make the minimum required contribution under this program as well as match employee contributions up to 10% of an employee's wages. The initial $2,500 of such employer contributions may be applied to an UP savings account and used for certain nonroutine expenses such as a large medical bill or home mortgage down payment. Employer contributions to UP accounts are generally deferred from income tax and employee contributions may be pretax or posttax. Employers also receive a tax credit for a specified proportion of the minimum contribution amount for up to the employer's first 30 employees. Additionally, the bill also increases the highest individual income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% and the highest corporate income tax rate from 21% to 23%."
