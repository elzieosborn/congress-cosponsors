DHS may not continue a contract with any facility deemed less than adequate in two of the most recent inspector general inspections, audits, or investigations.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties within DHS shall (1) investigate civil rights and civil liberties complaints in immigration detention facilities, and (2) periodically release on a public website data about such complaints and investigations.\n\nThe bill requires various reports to Congress, including a DHS plan for decreasing the number of immigration detention beds and implementing community-based alternatives to detention."
