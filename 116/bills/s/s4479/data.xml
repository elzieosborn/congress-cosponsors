  <summary date="2020-12-03T19:24:34Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill temporarily revises bankruptcy provisions related to a lease of nonresidential real property. Specifically, if a Chapter 11 small business reorganization bankruptcy debtor is experiencing material financial hardship due to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, a court may extend the time the debtor may pay rent on a nonresidential real property from 60 days to 120 days. Additionally, businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic have an additional 90 days to determine whether to keep or end a nonresidential lease agreement.

The bill also prohibits a bankruptcy trustee from voiding transfers of the debtor's interest due to the payment of certain rental and supplier arrearages.

These provisions have a two-year sunset.</summary>
