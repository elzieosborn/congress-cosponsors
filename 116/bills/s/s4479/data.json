    "text": "This bill temporarily revises bankruptcy provisions related to a lease of nonresidential real property. Specifically, if a Chapter 11 small business reorganization bankruptcy debtor is experiencing material financial hardship due to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, a court may extend the time the debtor may pay rent on a nonresidential real property from 60 days to 120 days. Additionally, businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic have an additional 90 days to determine whether to keep or end a nonresidential lease agreement.\n\nThe bill also prohibits a bankruptcy trustee from voiding transfers of the debtor's interest due to the payment of certain rental and supplier arrearages.\n\nThese provisions have a two-year sunset."
