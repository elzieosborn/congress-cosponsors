  <summary date="2019-11-21T20:07:56Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety Act of 2019

This bill addresses highway-rail grade crossing safety.

The bill reauthorizes the highway safety improvement program through FY2024, with $50 million set aside in FY2020-FY2024 for the Railway-Highway Crossings Program.

Eligibility requirements are revised for the award of capital grants to states under the rail line relocation and improvement program.

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) must hire

 16 full-time grade crossing safety managers to work with state and local officials to identify safety improvements to highway-rail grade crossings; and 8 trespass prevention managers to work with local governments, schools, businesses, and railroads to develop site-specific mitigation plans. The Department of Transportation must gather and publish information and statistics relating to highway-rail grade crossing problems, including from studies conducted by the FRA, rail carriers, and independent entities.</summary>
