  <summary date="2020-10-09T12:57:18Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill provides FY2020 supplemental appropriations to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the COVID-19 Telehealth Program.

 Under the program, the FCC provides funding for health care providers to purchase telecommunications services, information services, and devices necessary to provide critical connected care services during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

The bill designates the funding as emergency spending, which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.</summary>
