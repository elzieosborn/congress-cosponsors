Specifically, consumer goods include those deemed vital and necessary by public health officials for the health, safety, and welfare of consumers during an emergency or disaster (e.g., food, water, medications, and personal protective equipment). The price of these goods is presumptively excessive or oppressive during such an emergency or disaster if the sale price exceeds by more than 10% the average price of such good during the 120-day period preceding the emergency or disaster."
