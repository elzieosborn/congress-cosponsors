This bill establishes and funds grants to provide services to youth aging out of the foster care system. Such grants must be awarded based on specified degrees of evidence-based effectiveness. Grant applications must specify the target population for the grant, such as foster youth who (1) are at risk of homelessness; (2) have, or are expecting, a child; (3) lack financial stability; or (4) have been involved with the juvenile justice system.

The bill also modifies child welfare programs to facilitate the enforcement of child support orders.</summary>
