This bill expands various sanctions and reporting requirements pertaining to North Korea and contains other related provisions.

The bill expands existing sanctions related to various prohibitions against North Korea to cover parties that knowingly sponsor or provide significant support&#160;for violations of such prohibitions. Individuals engaging in prohibited conduct may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment.

The President shall impose sanctions on entities that knowingly transfer crude oil to North Korea or to an affiliated entity.

The Department of State shall report on U.S. efforts to pressure North Korea, including a list of countries that are uncooperative with such efforts. The State Department may (1) alter U.S. diplomatic relations with such countries, such as by reducing engagement; and (2) reduce foreign assistance to such countries.

The President must make certifications to Congress before (1) removing certain persons from a blocked persons&#160;list maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or (2) terminating North Korea's designation as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.

The Department of Homeland Security may require enhanced screening procedures for cargo originating from a country of concern with respect to evading sanctions against North Korea.

The bill calls for briefings and reports on various topics, including (1) North Korea's use of rocket fuels for its ballistic missiles, (2) Russian efforts to block United Nations sanctions against North Korea, and (3) businesses and countries that employ North Korean laborers.</summary>
