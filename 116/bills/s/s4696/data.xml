This bill directs the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to establish a program to identify and convey available federal land in Alaska to the University of Alaska for a land grant to support higher education.

No later than two years after enactment of the bill, Alaska and the university may jointly identify no more than 500,000 acres of land for inclusion in the program. Upon the request of Alaska and the university, the BLM shall provide technical assistance in the identification of land.

If Alaska and the university submit to the BLM one or more joint letters concurring with the conveyance of all or a portion of the land identified for conveyance, the BLM shall convey the land to the Board of Regents of the university, to be held in trust for the exclusive use and benefit of the university.

The BLM shall convey no more than 360,000 acres of land to the university.

The BLM shall notify Congress upon conveyance of the land.</summary>
