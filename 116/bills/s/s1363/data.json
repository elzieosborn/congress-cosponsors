The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must (1) issue a memorandum to federal agencies regarding AI governance approaches, to be followed by preparation and submission of governance plans by the agencies and updates at specified intervals; and (2) issue a draft version of the memorandum for public comment and submit to Congress a comprehensive plan with a time line to complete requirements of this bill.\n\nThe bill requires agencies that use or anticipate using AI to submit to the OMB and post on a publicly available page of the agency website a plan to achieve consistency with the memorandum.\n\nIn addition, the Office of Personnel Management must, among other things\n\n identify key skills and competencies needed for positions related to AI; and establish an occupational series, or revise an existing job series, to include positions the primary duties of which relate to AI."
