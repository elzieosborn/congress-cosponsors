  <summary date="2020-09-09T17:42:08Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Tenant Protection Act

This bill prohibits a credit reporting agency from creating a report containing a landlord-tenant court or other housing court record unless

 the case resulted in a judgment of possession, the decision is not being appealed, and the record is not more than three years old. If a person takes an adverse action against a consumer based upon a housing court record contained in a credit report, the person must provide the consumer a free copy of the report.

A person who willfully creates a credit report that contains an inaccurate housing record is civilly liable to the consumer.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must (1) issue regulations that direct tenant rating agencies to create a central source for consumers to obtain reports and submit disputes, and (2) report on tenant rating agency compliance.</summary>
