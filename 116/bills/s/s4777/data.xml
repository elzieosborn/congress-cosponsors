This bill restores leave that is lost by federal employees during a public health emergency relating to a pandemic. Specifically, the bill restores leave for employees of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government that was lost because the employee's accumulated leave exceeded the maximum amount that is otherwise allowable.

The bill applies to leave that is lost on or after the date of enactment of this bill.</summary>
