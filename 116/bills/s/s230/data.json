    "text": "Preserving American Justice Act\n\nThis bill requires an investigation to determine whether the Saudi Arabian government helped any Saudi citizen or national leave the United States to escape criminal prosecution. It also establishes certain penalties for foreign governments that assist with such departures.\n\nSpecifically, the bill directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate whether the Saudi Arabian government materially assisted or facilitated the departure of any Saudi citizen or national in order to escape criminal prosecution in the United States. Further, DOJ must submit a report to Congress and the Department of State if it determines the Saudi Arabian government committed such acts.\n\nThe bill generally prohibits the issuance of visas to certain Saudi nationals or citizens if DOJ determines that the Saudi Arabian government assisted any Saudi national or citizen in escaping criminal prosecution.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ must annually report on foreign nationals who leave the United States while awaiting trial or sentencing for a criminal offense that was committed in the United States.\n\nDOJ must also maintain a list of countries that it determines have materially assisted or facilitated the departure of foreign nationals. Further, the bill makes foreign governments that are included on this list ineligible for the tax exclusion for certain income received from investments in the United States."
