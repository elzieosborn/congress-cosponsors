This bill modifies the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, the bill extends the program through August 15, 2020, and it allows a loan recipient to select any eight-week period within the program's duration to use their loan.

The bill also prohibits the Small Business Administration from requiring a paycheck protection loan recipient to use at least 50% of loan amounts for payroll costs.

Further, the bill defers payment of applicable employment taxes for a paycheck protection loan recipient that has had loan amounts forgiven. Currently, a taxpayer that has had loan amounts forgiven is ineligible for such deferral.</summary>
