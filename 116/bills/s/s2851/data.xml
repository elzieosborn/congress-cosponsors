  <summary date="2021-01-15T21:08:04Z" status="Passed Senate">This bill revises conflict-of-interest limitations applicable to personnel at the Government Publishing Office (GPO).

Current law prohibits GPO personnel from having any printing-related interest.

This bill creates an exemption for certain interests&#8212;interests in diversified mutual funds, diversified unit investment trusts, employee benefit plans, and retirement plans&#8212;that have underlying holdings in printing-related interests.

Additionally, the prohibition applies only to the GPO director&#8212;not to other GPO personnel.</summary>
