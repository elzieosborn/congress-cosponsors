    "text": "Health Force and Resilience Force Act of 2020\n\nThis bill establishes and expands programs to bring on individuals to perform public health functions, such as contact tracing and vaccine administration, to respond to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency and meet other public health needs after that emergency ends.\n\nThe bill provides funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish a Health Force to recruit and train individuals for roles in public health and health care. The funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules. Among other activities, the CDC must award grants to, or enter into contracts with, states and other jurisdictions to hire and deploy Health Force personnel.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency must hire and train additional individuals for its Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees. These employees may be detailed to certain federal agencies or to state, local, or tribal governments to support efforts with respect to COVID-19 and other disasters and emergencies."
