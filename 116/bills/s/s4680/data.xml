This bill addresses jurisdiction of U.S. district courts over eminent domain proceedings and the use of eminent domain by the holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to acquire land or property with respect to natural gas pipelines.

Specifically, the bill

 provides that U.S. districts courts shall not have jurisdiction to condemn property in which a state owns any interest, and prohibits the holder of a certification of public convenience and necessity that authorizes construction and operation of a natural gas pipeline from exercising the right of eminent domain for a pipeline designed to export liquefied natural gas to a foreign country.</summary>
