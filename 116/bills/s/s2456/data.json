    "text": "Clean Water Through Green Infrastructure Act\n\nThis bill establishes grant programs for innovative stormwater control infrastructure, which means any green stormwater management technique that (1) uses systems that mimic natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or capture stormwater; and (2) preserves, enhances, or mimics natural hydrology to protect or restore water quality.\n\nSpecifically, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must provide grants to eligible institutions of higher education or research institutions to establish and maintain between three and five centers of excellence for innovative stormwater control infrastructure. Among other things, the centers must research such infrastructure and provide technical assistance to state, tribal, and local governments to assist with stormwater control infrastructure projects. One of the centers must be the national electronic clearinghouse center. That center must operate a website and a public database on the infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, the EPA must provide grants to state, tribal, or local governments or entities that manage stormwater, drinking water resources, or wastewater resources for innovative stormwater control infrastructure projects."
