Specifically, the bill concerns veterans with service-connected disabilities to whom the VA is required to provide nursing home care. Medical foster homes are homes designed to provide non-institutional, long-term, supportive care for veterans who are unable to live independently and prefer a family setting.\n\nIn any year, not more than a daily average of 900 veterans placed in a medical foster home may have their care covered."
