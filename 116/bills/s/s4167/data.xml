  <summary date="2020-07-27T16:58:26Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Small Business Disaster Loan Enhancement Act of 2020

This bill authorizes and provides funding for additional disaster loans and grants made to small businesses by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and temporarily limits the interest rate for certain economic injury disaster loans.

Specifically, the bill authorizes an additional disaster loan to a prior recipient that received such a loan during the period between February 15, 2020, and December 31, 2020, up to an aggregate amount of $2 million. Further, the bill prohibits the SBA from imposing a maximum loan amount limit that is lower than $2 million for an initial disaster loan; rather, the SBA shall only consider the financial need and ability of the applicant to repay.

The bill also authorizes a recipient of such additional lending to request an additional advance, up to an aggregate amount of $10,000. A recipient that suffered a decline in revenue of not less than 50% between March 2, 2020, and December 31, 2020, may request an advance of not more than $25,000.

Further, the interest rate for any economic injury disaster loan made between February 15, 2020, and December 31, 2020, shall not exceed 1%.

Any amounts made available to provide loans under the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) that are unobligated as of August 8, 2020, shall be made available for SBA disaster loans.</summary>
