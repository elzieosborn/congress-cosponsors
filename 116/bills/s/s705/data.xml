This bill prohibits the use of funds to take any action that would violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) during the six-month withdrawal period that&#160;started after the United States provided notice of its intention to withdraw from the treaty on February 2, 2019.

During the six-month period, the Department of State shall periodically report to Congress on (1) U.S. efforts to bring Russia into compliance with the INF Treaty during the withdrawal period, (2) the status of the development of various Russian missile systems that would fall under the INF Treaty, and (3) the status of negotiations of the new arms control proposal the President referenced in his State of the Union Address on February 5, 2019.</summary>
