  <summary date="2020-05-27T16:51:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Farmers-Feeding-Families Coronavirus Response Act 

This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to use specified federal funding to purchase specialty crops, dairy, meat, and poultry products from specific agricultural producers relying on markets affected by COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) to provide to food assistance programs, including the Emergency Food Assistance Program.

USDA must also provide additional funding to the states for the purpose of procuring food products to support food assistance programs within each state.

USDA and the states must use at least 10% of the funding to purchase crops and products that would otherwise have been sold through direct-to-consumer, direct-to-institution, direct-to-retail, or direct-to-restaurant marketing channels.</summary>
