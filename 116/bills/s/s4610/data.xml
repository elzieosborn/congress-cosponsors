  <summary date="2020-10-09T16:26:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Wear Your Mask Act

This bill requires each federal agency to take action to ensure that an individual is required to wear a face mask inside a federal facility under its jurisdiction if the individual is within six feet of another individual to minimize the transmission of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Each agency shall make face masks available at each entrance to a federal facility at which such agency maintains a presence.

The bill terminates such requirements when the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases determines, and publishes in the Federal Register a notification, that the requirement to wear a mask is no longer necessary to prevent such transmission.</summary>
