Specifically, the notice shall state that (1) an adverse immigration determination may not be based solely on information furnished by the party engaged in the unlawful activity, and (2) the alien's information shall not be disclosed. Such an alien may not be removed until the appropriate law enforcement agency has had a chance to interview the alien.\n\nRemoval proceedings against an alien who has filed or is a witness to a workplace claim shall be stayed until the resolution of the claim, with limited exceptions."
