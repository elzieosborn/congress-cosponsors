This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to increase diversity of ownership in the broadcasting industry.

Specifically, the bill allows companies engaged in the qualifying sale of a broadcast station to receive favorable tax treatment by electing nonrecognition of the gain or loss resulting from the sale. To qualify for this treatment, the sale must result in or preserve ownership of a broadcast station by socially disadvantaged individuals.

The bill also requires the FCC to foster investment in broadcast stations owned by socially disadvantaged individuals.</summary>
