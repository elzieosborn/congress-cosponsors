In addition, the federal agencies involved\u00a0with the agenda\u00a0must prioritize its implementation and take certain steps to achieve that goal.\n\nThe bill also establishes the position of the United States Coordinator for Global Health Security in the executive branch to coordinate federal responses to global health security emergencies."
