This bill directs the President to create the Global Health Security Agenda Interagency Review Council to implement the Global Health Security Agenda, an initiative launched by nearly 30 nations to address global infectious disease threats.

The council's responsibilities include (1) providing policy recommendations on agenda-related goals, objectives, and implementation; (2) helping federal agencies with implementation; and (3) reviewing the progress and challenges in achieving U.S. commitments, including assistance to help other countries meet agenda&#160;targets. In addition, the federal agencies involved&#160;with the agenda&#160;must prioritize its implementation and take certain steps to achieve that goal.

The bill also establishes the position of the United States Coordinator for Global Health Security in the executive branch to coordinate federal responses to global health security emergencies.</summary>
