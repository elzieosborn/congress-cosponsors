This bill directs the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to implement a safety framework to protect its personnel from exposure to potential synthetic opioids.

Among other things, the CBP must do the following:

 issue a policy that specifies protocols and procedures for the safe handling of potential synthetic opioids; require mandatory training on the potential risk of exposure to and safe handling procedures for synthetic opioids, as well as how to administer opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naloxone) after exposure; and provide personal protective equipment and opioid receptor antagonists to officers, agents, other personnel, and canines at risk of exposure to synthetic opioids.</summary>
