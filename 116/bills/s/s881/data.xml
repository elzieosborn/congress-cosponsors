This bill sets forth provisions concerning improving the ability of the United States to forecast space weather events and mitigate the effects of space weather.

The bill provides statutory authority for the National Science and Technology Council's Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation Working Group, which coordinates executive branch efforts regarding space weather.

The bill directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Science Foundation, Air Force, Navy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and U.S. Geological Survey to carry out specified space weather activities.

NOAA may establish a pilot program under which NOAA offers to enter into contracts with entities in the commercial space weather sector to provide NOAA with space weather data that meets certain standards.

The working group must periodically review and update the benchmarks described in the report of the National Science and Technology Council titled Space Weather Phase 1 Benchmarks and dated June 2018, as necessary, based on (1) any significant new data or advances in scientific understanding that become available, or (2) the evolving needs of entities impacted by space weather phenomena.</summary>
