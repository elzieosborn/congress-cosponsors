A state energy security plan must contain specified content, including a risk assessment of energy infrastructure and cross-sector interdependencies and a risk mitigation approach to enhance reliability and end-use resilience. The plan must address potential hazards to each energy sector or system, including physical threats and cybersecurity threats.</summary>
