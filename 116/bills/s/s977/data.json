    "text": "Transparent Drug Pricing Act of 2019\n\nThis bill establishes several requirements relating to the prices of prescription drugs.\n\nFor example, state Medicaid drug-use review programs must require pharmacists to disclose an individual's out-of-pocket cost for a prescription drug, and the price without health insurance, at the point-of-sale. Additionally, health insurers must publish the co-payment amount for each covered prescription drug prior to the annual open-enrollment period.\n\nThe bill also temporarily prohibits the retail list price of drugs and biologics from exceeding the lowest retail list price among Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, or Germany."
