Under the program, a primary care\u00a0practice\u00a0shall be accountable for (1)\u00a0providing comprehensive, coordinated, continuous, and accessible care to applicable Medicare beneficiaries at home; and (2) coordinating health care across all treatment settings.\n\nSubject to meeting specified quality performance standards, a participating practice\u00a0is eligible to\u00a0receive an incentive payment under the program if actual expenditures for applicable beneficiaries are less than\u00a0the estimated spending target established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nThe CMS shall terminate a program\u00a0agreement with a participating practice if the practice (1)\u00a0for the third of three consecutive years under the program, did not achieve savings; or (2) fails to meet a minimum number of quality performance standards established by the CMS.\n\nThe bill extends the existing Independence at Home Medical Practice Demonstration Program pending implementation of the permanent program. In addition, the bill\u00a0removes the limit on the number of beneficiaries that may participate in the demonstration program."
