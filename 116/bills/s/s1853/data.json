The bill expands access to (1) the national crime information database for NamUs, and (2) the NCIC for each tribal justice official.\n\nFinally, the Department of the Interior must establish a five-year demonstration program for the purpose of conducting or adjudicating personnel background investigations for applicants for law enforcement positions in the BIA."
