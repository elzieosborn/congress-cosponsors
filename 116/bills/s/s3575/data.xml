This bill addresses Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) assistance entitlements and subsistence allowances.

Under the bill, an assistance payment for training and rehabilitation programs for veterans with service-connected disabilities shall not be charged against an individual's entitlement to such assistance if an individual was unable to complete a course or program due to the closure of an educational institution or disapproval of the course.

The bill also authorizes the VA to continue to pay subsistence allowances for a specified amount of time during periods following the permanent closure of an institution or the disapproval of a course of study.</summary>
