The bill also requires reports to Congress on the effect of a treaty lapse on U.S. intelligence-collection capabilities, the structure of the Armed Forces, U.S. nuclear weapons programs, and foreign relations. The President shall report to Congress on the progress of treaty-related discussions with Russia and a strategy for future strategic arms control agreements with Russia.\n\nThe bill prohibits increasing the number of various U.S. weapons (such as deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles) above specified thresholds if the treaty lapses or if the President takes certain actions to withdraw from or suspend the treaty, unless the President certifies that Russia has made certain militarily significant increases to its weapons stockpiles."
