  <summary date="2020-12-01T19:42:41Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill provides an automatic extension for certain J-1 (exchange visitor) visas if the visa holder has a contract or employment agreement with the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the agency that operates U.S. government media outlets such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.

Specifically, if such a J-1 visa expires during the two-month period before this bill's enactment or the 90-day period after, the visa shall remain valid until the end of the 90-day period. The Department of Homeland Security may deny an extension on a case-by-case basis if it (1) determines that extending a particular visa would pose a national security risk, and (2) explains the reasons for the determination to Congress.</summary>
