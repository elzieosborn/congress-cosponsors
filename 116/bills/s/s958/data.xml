This bill requires verification and notice of the removal of registrants from an official list of eligible voters. Specifically, the bill requires a state or political subdivision to provide notice to individual registrants that are removed, the grounds for the removal, and information on contesting the removal. Public notice must be provided after any systematic removal of names.

The bill provides conditions for the removal of names from an official list of eligible voters. A state is prohibited from removing a name unless the state verifies that the registrant is ineligible to vote. A state is prohibited from considering failure to vote in an election or failure to respond to a notice as evidence of ineligibility to vote.</summary>
