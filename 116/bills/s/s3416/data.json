The CFATS program regulates high-risk chemical facilities to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks.\n\nAmong other requirements, DHS must\n\n issue a strategy to improve the cybersecurity of chemical facilities and the sharing of information with local emergency responders; prescribe regulations to establish the CFATS Recognition Program to enhance security of chemical facilities and provide incentives for greater regulatory relief; conduct a review every two years of audits and inspections and develop an official standard to evaluate the consistency of such audits and inspections; implement a Personnel Surety Program with respect to Tier 3 and Tier 4 facilities (currently, limited to Tier 1 [highest risk] and Tier 2); make information available to state, local, and regional fusion centers and state and local government officials, in a secure and expeditious manner; and implement a system under which an owner or operator of a chemical facility may request an informal consultation relating to a preliminary deficiency determination."
