This bill requires the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) to implement certain cybersecurity measures.

Specifically, CISA, in consultation with MARAD and the U.S. Coast Guard, shall make a resource available to assist maritime operators in identifying, detecting, protecting against, responding to, and recovering from cyber incidents.

MARAD must also designate a cyber coordinator office to, among other things, (1) coordinate cybersecurity activities for the commercial maritime sector and cyber incidents that affect maritime operators, and (2) notify CISA and the Coast Guard of unaddressed cyber incidents that affect maritime operators.</summary>
