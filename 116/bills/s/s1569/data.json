Currently, cybersecurity assistance is considered to be an in-kind contribution.\n\nFurther, the bill prohibits an authorized committee from selling any cybersecurity technology, products, or services that were purchased with building funds. However, such items may be donated to charitable organizations or government agencies at the end of a campaign.\n\nThe bill also specifies that cybersecurity technology, products, or services that are provided at less than fair-market value to a political committee or candidate are generally considered in-kind contributions."
