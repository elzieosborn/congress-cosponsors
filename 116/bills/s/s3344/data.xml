This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to develop and disseminate an evidence-based curriculum on substance use disorders (e.g., opioids, tobacco, and vaping) for grades K-12. ED must review and update such curriculum every two years.

Additionally, ED must award grants to state educational agencies to implement such evidence-based curriculum. In awarding such grants, ED must give priority to those states that have experienced the highest drug overdose death rates per capita.</summary>
