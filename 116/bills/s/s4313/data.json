These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.\n\nSpecifically, HHS must award grants to national or state medical organizations and other institutions that have expertise in diseases and conditions related to PFAS to provide these trainings."
