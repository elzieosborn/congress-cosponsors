Identity factors include gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, income, criminal background, military service, first-generation students, students with disabilities, student parents, and transfer students.\n\nIn addition, ED must award grants to IHEs for executing improvement plans that address inequities.\n\nFinally, higher education accrediting agencies and associations must assess the findings from the audits and assist IHEs in addressing inequities."
