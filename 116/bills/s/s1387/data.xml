This bill revises the service obligation verification process for the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grant program.

For example, the bill provides a process for the Department of Education to reconsider and reverse the conversion of a TEACH grant to a loan. The bill also establishes certain program flexibilities with respect to the service obligations of teachers affected by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.</summary>
