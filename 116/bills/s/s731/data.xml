This bill revises the waiver authority of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)&#160;for polygraph examinations of applicants for law enforcement positions in the CBP. Such waiver authority terminates five years after the enactment of this bill.

Any individual who receives such waiver and holds a current background investigation may be subject to further background investigation.

The CBP may administer a polygraph examination to an applicant for employment or an employee who is eligible for a waiver if information is discovered prior to the completion of a background investigation that makes necessary a final determination regarding suitability for employment or continued employment.</summary>
