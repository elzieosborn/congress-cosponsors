The State Department shall periodically report to Congress on recommendations for continued actions.\n\nThe State Department shall establish an independent Reconciliation Board to contact any employee (or a family member of a deceased employee) improperly terminated during the Lavender Scare and offer to change the employee's record to reflect such a finding. The board shall accept and review grievances from former employees who believe they were terminated due to sexual orientation.\n\nThe State Department shall establish a board of senior-level officials to address issues that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) Foreign Service employees and their families face. The board shall report to Congress comments on or recommendations for improving State Department policies to prevent sexual orientation discrimination.\n\nThe State Department shall report to Congress on (1) countries that do not issue spousal visas for Foreign Service employee spouses due to sexual orientation, and (2) recommendations on how to address\u00a0the issue."
