This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat ambulance services as reimbursable emergency services in certain circumstances. Specifically, services are reimbursable when the ambulance request was made because of the sudden onset of a medical condition that would reasonably be expected to be hazardous to the individual in the absence of immediate medical attention.</summary>
