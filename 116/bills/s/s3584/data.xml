This bill addresses the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency, including by requiring occupational standards to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure.

Within one month of the bill's enactment, the Department of Labor must establish emergency temporary standards to protect health care sector employees, first responders, and other elevated-risk employees from occupational exposure to COVID-19. Labor shall establish permanent standards within 24 months of the bill's enactment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall collect data and analyze reports on cases of COVID-19 among the employees covered by the emergency temporary standards.

The bill also conditions a medical facility's receipt of certain Medicare funds on the facility's compliance with the permanent standards established under the bill.</summary>
