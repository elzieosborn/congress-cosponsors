This bill establishes programs that address water pollution along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Specifically, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Tijuana River Public Health and Water Quality Restoration Program. Under the program, the EPA must plan, implement, coordinate, and provide grants for public health and water quality restoration and protection activities in the Mexican Tijuana River watershed and the American Tijuana River watershed in California.

In addition, the EPA must establish the California New River Public Health and Water Quality Restoration Program to plan, implement, coordinate, and provide grants for water quality restoration and protection activities in the New River watershed.

Finally, the bill provides statutory authority for the U.S.-Mexico Border Water Infrastructure Program to provide assistance for activities related to the construction of infrastructure for drinking water treatment or distribution, wastewater management, or stormwater management.</summary>
