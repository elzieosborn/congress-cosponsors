This bill requires the Department of State to annually report to Congress on steps the State Department has taken to help strengthen Taiwan's diplomatic relationships and partnerships around the world. (Taiwan is self-governing, but China considers it a renegade province and has taken actions to encourage countries and international organizations to limit or cut off relations with Taiwan.)</summary>
