    "text": "Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019 This bill requires specified commercial entities to conduct assessments of high-risk systems that involve personal information or make automated decisions, such as systems that use artificial intelligence or machine learning. Specifically, high-risk automated decision systems include those that (1) may contribute to inaccuracy, bias, or discrimination; or (2) facilitate decision-making about sensitive aspects of consumers' lives by evaluating consumers' behavior. Further, an automated-decision system, or information system involving personal data, is considered high-risk if it (1) raises security or privacy concerns, (2) involves the personal information of a significant number of people, or (3) systematically monitors a large, publicly accessible physical location. Assessments of high-risk automated-decision systems must (1) describe the system in detail, (2) assess the relative costs and benefits of the system, (3) determine the risks to the privacy and security of personal information, and (4) explain the steps taken to minimize those risks, if discovered. Assessments of high-risk information systems involving personal information must evaluate the extent to which the system protects the privacy and security of such information."
