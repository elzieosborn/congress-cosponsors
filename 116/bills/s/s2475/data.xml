  <summary date="2022-02-16T15:00:39Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill modifies the effective date on which certain active duty service members are included under the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement Program. This program allows colleges and universities to voluntarily enter into agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover costs that are not covered by existing educational assistance amounts.

The bill includes under the program active duty service members who are pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis starting on August 1, 2020, instead of the previous effective date of August 1, 2022.</summary>
