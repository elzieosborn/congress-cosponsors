    "text": "Student Right to Know Before You Go Act of 2019\n\nThis bill requires the National Center for Education Statistics to establish and maintain a new higher education data system. The Center must use the system to calculate student education, debt-related, and earning metrics (e.g., student graduation rates, transfer rates, rates of continuation to subsequent levels of education, dropout rates, loan debt amounts, loan repayment rates, and debt-to-earnings ratios) for each institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs. The metrics must be disaggregated and separately provided on the basis of specified categories.\n\nThe system must meet requirements for minimizing privacy and security risks.\n\nThe bill provides for the transition from the existing Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to the new higher education data system.\n\nThe Department of Education (ED) must publish the metrics and post the metrics on its website. Within five years, an IHE that participates in federal student aid programs must display links on its website to ED's website that provides metrics data."
