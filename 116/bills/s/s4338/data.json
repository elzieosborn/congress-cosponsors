Additionally, the implementation of, and conversion to, the New Swine Slaughter Inspection System must be suspended.\n\nNo funds made available to USDA during such period shall be used to develop, propose, finalize, issue, amend, or implement any policy, regulation, directive, constituent update, or any other agency program that would increase line speeds at meat and poultry establishments.\n\nNot later than 90 days after the end of the period, the Government Accountability Office shall conduct a review of actions taken by specific federal agencies, including USDA, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to determine the effectiveness of such actions in protecting animal, food, and worker safety."
