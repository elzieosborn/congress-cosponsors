This bill authorizes appropriations for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) through FY2029.

USADA shall

 serve as the independent anti-doping organization for the amateur athletic competitions recognized by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, be responsible for certifying in advance any testing conducted by international organizations under the World Anti-Doping Code for international amateur athletes and athletic competitions occurring within U.S. jurisdiction, and be recognized worldwide as the independent national anti-doping organization for the United States. Any administrative action taken by USADA to enforce a USADA policy, procedure, or requirement against a person with respect to a violation of federal law shall be carried out in a manner that provides due process protection to the person.

The bill also directs (1) USADA to promote a positive youth sport experience by providing educational materials on sportsmanship, character building, and healthy performance for those participating in youth sports; and (2) the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Food and Drug Administration&#160;to provide to USADA information relating to the prevention of the use of performance-enhancing drugs or the prohibition of performance-enhancing methods.</summary>
