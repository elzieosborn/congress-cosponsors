This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to reimburse a veteran for a co-payment owed for emergency treatment furnished at a non-VA facility if such veteran is enrolled in VA health care and is personally liable for such emergency treatment. Such reimbursements shall apply for emergency treatment furnished on or after February 1, 2010.

This bill shall not limit the rights of those certified as a class in the case of Wolfe v. Wilkie (i.e., all claimants whose claims for reimbursement of emergency medical expenses incurred at non-VA facilities).</summary>
