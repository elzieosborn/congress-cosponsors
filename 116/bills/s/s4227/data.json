Further, the bill prohibits the SBA from imposing a maximum loan amount limit that is lower than $2 million for an initial disaster loan.\n\nThe bill also requires the SBA to provide a disaster loan applicant with an advance no later than three days after the applicant submits a loan application, regardless of whether such application has been approved by that date. Further, the SBA shall provide a recipient of an additional disaster loan an additional advance such that the total advance amount received by the applicant is $10,000."
