  <summary date="2021-03-31T19:28:09Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Ensuring Increased Disaster Loans for Small Businesses Act or the EIDL for Small Businesses Act

This bill authorizes and provides funding for additional Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loans and advances on such loans, and it modifies the requirements for providing such advances.

Specifically, the bill authorizes an additional disaster loan to a prior recipient that received such a loan during the period between January 31, 2020, and December 31, 2020, up to an aggregate amount of $2 million. Further, the bill prohibits the SBA from imposing a maximum loan amount limit that is lower than $2 million for an initial disaster loan.

The bill also requires the SBA to provide a disaster loan applicant with an advance no later than three days after the applicant submits a loan application, regardless of whether such application has been approved by that date. Further, the SBA shall provide a recipient of an additional disaster loan an additional advance such that the total advance amount received by the applicant is $10,000.</summary>
