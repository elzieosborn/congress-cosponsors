  <summary date="2020-04-07T22:22:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill directs the Election Assistance Commission to create a national federal write-in absentee ballot that must be made available on the internet in a printable format.

States must permit certain individuals to use the ballot to cast a vote in any election for federal office. The individuals who qualify to use the ballot are those who

 reside in an area where a state of emergency has been declared by the state due to a natural disaster, expect to be absent from their jurisdiction on election day due to professional or volunteer service in response to a natural disaster or emergency, expect to be hospitalized on election day, or requested an absentee ballot but did not receive it in time for it to be counted in the election.</summary>
