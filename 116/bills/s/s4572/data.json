Under a presumption of service-connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded.\n\nThe bill also makes disability or death from certain diseases due to service in support of a military operation for at least 15 days in a specified location compensable as a work injury."
