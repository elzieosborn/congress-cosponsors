This bill directs the National Science and Technology Council to establish an interagency working group to coordinate activities to (1) protect federally funded research and development from foreign interference, cyberattacks, theft, or espionage; and (2) develop common definitions and best practices for federal science agencies and grantees, while taking into account the importance of the open exchange of ideas and international talent required for scientific progress and American leadership in science and technology.

The working group's responsibilities, among other things, shall include

 developing unclassified policy guidance to assist federal science agencies and grantees in having consistent policies to defend against threats to federally funded research and development and the integrity of the U.S. scientific enterprise, and developing guidelines to create a consistent cybersecurity policy across federal agencies to protect federally funded research and development from foreign interference theft or espionage through cybeersecurity breaches. The Office of Science and Technology Policy must provide biennial summary reports on the working group's activities and the most current version of such policy guidance and guidelines.

The National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense, and any other federal agencies, as appropriate, shall enter into a joint agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to create a National Science, Technology, and Security Roundtable.</summary>
