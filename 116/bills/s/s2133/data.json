The Office of Science and Technology Policy must provide biennial summary reports on the working group's activities and the most current version of such policy guidance and guidelines.\n\nThe National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense, and any other federal agencies, as appropriate, shall enter into a joint agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to create a National Science, Technology, and Security Roundtable."
