This bill directs each state that has a voter registration requirement for federal elections to automatically register eligible individuals when they turn 18 years old. States that do not implement automatic registration must permit eligible individuals to register and vote on the day of a federal election.

The Election Assistance Commission shall make grants to states to implement automatic voter registration and improve election security systems related to voter registration.

The bill revises the procedure for voting following a registered voter's failure to return a change of address card.</summary>
