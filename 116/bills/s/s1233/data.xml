This bill creates an exemption from internal control report attestation requirements for depository institutions with assets less than $5 billion. These institutions are also exempt from certain annual reports on financial condition and management.

The Securities and Exchange Commission must revise Regulation D (which exempts certain offerings from securities registration requirements) to (1) raise the limit on the number of purchasers of securities, and (2) include a person's primary residence as an asset used in determining whether a person is an accredited investor eligible to participate in these offerings.</summary>
