It also requires the center to provide modeling, simulation, and analyses to federal agencies upon request and not later than 15 days after completion.\n\nThe CISA shall provide by October 1, 2021, and annually thereafter, summaries of priorities of the center and of current projects carried out to each federal agency or department with critical infrastructure responsibilities. If such an agency requests additional information on a specific project, the CISA shall provide the information within 30 days after the request.\n\nThe CISA shall (1) within 45 days after this bill's enactment, provide all pandemic reports of the center completed before enactment to each federal agency with critical infrastructure responsibilities; and (2) by October 1, 2021, and annually thereafter, brief Congress on current pandemic modeling, simulation, and analyses of the center, and how the Department of Homeland Security is applying this information to current and future COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic work."
