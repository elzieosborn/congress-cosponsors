This bill addresses relief for areas impacted by a major disaster.

Specifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development must provide disaster recovery assistance under the Community Development Block Grant program to states, local governments, certain territories, and Indian tribes.

In addition, the Government Accountability Office must report on an existing grant program designed to help communities implement mitigation measures to reduce the risk of loss of life and property in future disasters.</summary>
