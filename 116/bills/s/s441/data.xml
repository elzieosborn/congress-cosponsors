This bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a federal agency from issuing a rule that causes a new financial or administrative burden on businesses or people in the United States unless the agency has repealed or amended two or more existing rules causing such a burden and the cost of the rule to be issued is less than or equal to that of the rules repealed or amended.

In determining whether to repeal such a rule, an agency must consider (1) whether the rule has achieved its purpose, has become obsolete, or overlaps with a rule to be issued; (2) any adverse effects that could materialize if the rule is repealed; and (3) whether the costs of the rule outweigh its benefits.</summary>
