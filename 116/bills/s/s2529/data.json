Specifically, the bill extends protections from retaliation to individuals who (1) assist in a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation of these violations, (2) make disclosures that are required or protected under any law subject to the CFTC's or the SEC's jurisdiction, or (3) provide information to supervisors or other employees with the authority to investigate potential misconduct. Currently, these protections apply only to individuals who report information directly to the CFTC or the SEC.\n\nThe bill also provides for the processing of these whistleblower awards no later than one year after the deadline to file a claim."
