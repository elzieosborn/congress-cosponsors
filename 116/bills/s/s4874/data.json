The bill establishes criteria for deciding which country's posts shall receive additional personnel, such as the number of nationals of that country who have been identified as a suspected terrorists and whether that country has been cooperative with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\n\nIn addition to existing duties, such personnel shall screen visa applications against U.S. criminal, national security, and terrorism databases.\n\nDHS shall establish a security fee for all nonimmigrant visa applications to offset the costs of operating and increasing the size of the visa security units."
