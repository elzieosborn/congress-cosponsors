This bill addresses the interaction of disaster recovery relief assistance provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Small Business Administration (SBA).

Specifically, the bill prohibits HUD and recipients of HUD disaster relief grants from (1) considering whether an applicant for assistance rejected a separate disaster loan from the SBA, or (2) reducing the amount of assistance by the amount of a rejected SBA loan.</summary>
