  <summary date="2020-11-13T19:07:54Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act 

This bill establishes investment programs and generally revises provisions related to community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions.

The Department of the Treasury must establish a Neighborhood Capital Investment Program to facilitate direct capital investments in low- and moderate-income community financial institutions. To qualify for the program, these institutions must, among other things, (1) demonstrate specified lending history regarding low-and moderate-income borrowers and other targeted populations, and (2) provide details regarding plans to expand or maintain lending to certain minority communities and historically disadvantaged borrowers.

The bill also establishes the Neighborhood Loan Program through the Federal Reserve Board's emergency powers to create a credit facility for small business loans, specifically targeting low- and moderate-income community financial institutions serving low- and moderate-income and minority communities. The bill requires certain amounts available through existing COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) economic aid programs to be set aside for the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.

Regarding minority depository institutions, the bill

 establishes the Minority Bank Deposit Program to expand the use of minority depository institutions to hold the deposits of federal departments and agencies, allows new minority depository institutions to take three years to meet initial capital requirements, and establishes a program allowing minority depository institutions to apply to receive deposits from certain Treasury accounts.</summary>
