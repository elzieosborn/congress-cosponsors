The bill also provides funding for\u00a0$1,200 tax rebates\u00a0to individuals, with additional $500\u00a0payments per qualifying child. The rebate begins phasing out\u00a0when\u00a0incomes exceed $75,000 (or $150,000 for joint filers).\n\nThe bill establishes limits on requirements for employers to provide paid leave.\n\nWith respect to taxes, the bill\n\n establishes special rules for certain tax-favored withdrawals from retirement plans; delays due dates for employer payroll taxes and estimated\u00a0tax payments\u00a0for corporations; and revises other provisions, including those\u00a0related to\u00a0losses, charitable deductions, and business interest. With respect to health care, the bill\n\n provides additional funding for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19; limits liability for volunteer health care professionals; prioritizes Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of certain drugs; allows emergency use of certain diagnostic tests that\u00a0are not approved\u00a0by the FDA; expands health-insurance coverage for diagnostic testing and requires coverage for preventative services and vaccines; revises other provisions, including those\u00a0regarding the medical supply chain, the national stockpile, the health care workforce, the Healthy Start program, telehealth services, nutrition services, Medicare, and Medicaid. With respect to education, the bill\n\n temporarily suspends payments for federal student loans; and\u00a0 otherwise revises provisions related to campus-based aid,\u00a0supplemental educational-opportunity grants,\u00a0federal work-study, subsidized loans, Pell grants, and foreign institutions. The bill also authorizes the Department of the Treasury\u00a0to temporarily guarantee money-market funds."
