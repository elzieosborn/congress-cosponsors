Within seven days of identifying such a person or entity, the President shall report the identification to Congress.\n\nIdentified individuals shall be barred from entering the United States and shall have current visas revoked. With respect to foreign persons and state-affiliated entities, the President shall impose one or more of specified sanctions, such as (1) prohibiting a U.S. person from making investments that would benefit an identified foreign person; (2) suspending security assistance to a foreign state, in the case of a state-affiliated entity; and (3) directing U.S. representatives to international financial institutions to oppose any loan that would benefit an identified foreign person or entity.\n\nThe President may impose additional sanctions on foreign states that are affiliated with an identified entity, such as the withdrawal\u00a0of security assistance or the\u00a0imposition of prohibitions on\u00a0arms shipments."
