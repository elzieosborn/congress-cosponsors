This bill directs the President to identify and impose sanctions on foreign persons and state-affiliated entities that engaged in or supported cyber activities that reasonably likely contributed to a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, or financial health. Within seven days of identifying such a person or entity, the President shall report the identification to Congress.

Identified individuals shall be barred from entering the United States and shall have current visas revoked. With respect to foreign persons and state-affiliated entities, the President shall impose one or more of specified sanctions, such as (1) prohibiting a U.S. person from making investments that would benefit an identified foreign person; (2) suspending security assistance to a foreign state, in the case of a state-affiliated entity; and (3) directing U.S. representatives to international financial institutions to oppose any loan that would benefit an identified foreign person or entity.

The President may impose additional sanctions on foreign states that are affiliated with an identified entity, such as the withdrawal&#160;of security assistance or the&#160;imposition of prohibitions on&#160;arms shipments.</summary>
