The bill provides statutory authority for the agency's existing initiatives. Such initiatives include the Minority Business Development Center Program, which is a national network of public-private partnerships that assist, provide counseling and mentoring to, and facilitate the growth of minority businesses.\n\nThe bill also establishes new initiatives to promote resiliency for minority businesses, such as (1) an annual government-business forum to review the status of problems and programs relating to capital formation by minority businesses, (2) an agency study on opportunities to provide alternative financing solutions to minority businesses, and (3) grants to institutions of higher education for developing and implementing entrepreneurship curricula."
