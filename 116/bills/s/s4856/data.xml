  <summary date="2020-11-10T20:24:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a major medical facility project starting in FY2021 for the construction of a VA medical center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The bill requires the VA and the Department of Defense to jointly submit a report assessing the feasibility and advisability of providing health care services to both veterans and active duty service members at the new Colorado facility.

After appropriations are provided for the project, the VA must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to procure services to carry out the major medical facility project to completion as the construction agent.</summary>
