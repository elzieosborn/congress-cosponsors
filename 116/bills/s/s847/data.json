Facial-recognition data includes attributes or features of the face that permit facial-recognition technology to uniquely and consistently identify a specific individual. Controllers of facial recognition data also are prohibited from (1) using such data to discriminate against end users, (2) using such data for a purpose that is not reasonably foreseeable to the end user, (3) sharing such data with a third party without the additional affirmative consent of the end user, or (4) conditioning the use of a product on an end user providing affirmative consent."
