This bill imposes sanctions on foreign entities related to surveillance in China's Xinjiang province.

The President shall (1) report to Congress a list of foreign entities that provide the Chinese government with technology to conduct surveillance in Xinjiang; and (2) consider whether specified entities, such as China Communications Services Co. Ltd., should be on the list. Entities on the list shall be subject to Bureau of Industry and Security export licensing requirements. Such entities, and any corporate officer or primary shareholder, shall be subject to property-blocking sanctions.

The Department of Commerce may not remove Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (or any subsidiaries or affiliates) from the President's list until the President certifies that Huawei (1) is not involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, and (2) does not conduct or facilitate Chinese government surveillance in Xinjiang.

U.S. entities that conduct transactions with entities on the President's list shall disclose such transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</summary>
