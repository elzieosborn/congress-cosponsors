For patents issued after approval of an application, a drug manufacturer must submit the required patent information within 30 days of issuance. The USPTO must publish the patent information and invite requests for patent validity challenges.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration must provisionally list in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations publication (commonly known as the Orange Book) a drug patent submitted to the USPTO in accordance with this bill until the Patent Trial and Appeal Board confirms the patent to be patentable or the patent is not challenged within a specific time frame."
