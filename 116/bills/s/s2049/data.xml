  <summary date="2020-03-10T21:06:36Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to automatically discharge loans under the Federal Family Education Loan program for certain borrowers who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Specifically, ED must

 automatically discharge a veteran borrower's loan when the Department of Veterans Affairs has assigned the borrower a rating of total disability for a service-connected disability or has determined the borrower to be unemployable due to a service-connected condition, determine whether a state might&#160;impose a tax liability for the discharge of such a loan, and provide&#160;the borrower with a notification related to potential tax liability and an opportunity to opt out of such loan discharge.</summary>
