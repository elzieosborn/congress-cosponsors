  <summary date="2020-05-22T19:06:52Z" status="Reported to Senate">Venezuelan Contracting Restriction Act 

This bill prohibits an executive agency from entering into a contract for the procurement of goods or services with any person that it determines, with the concurrence of the Department of State, knowingly engages in significant business operations with an authority of the Venezuelan government that is not recognized by the U.S. government as the legitimate government of Venezuela. (The United States recognizes Juan Guaido as interim President of the legitimate government of Venezuela.)

This bill provides exceptions, including for (1) contracts that the State Department determines to be in the national security interest of the United States, and (2) contracts that support U.S. government activities in Venezuela.</summary>
