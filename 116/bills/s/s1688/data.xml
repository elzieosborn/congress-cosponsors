  <summary date="2020-01-25T20:01:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill establishes certain requirements relating to health care billing practices.

Specifically, the bill requires health care facilities and practitioners to (1) provide patients with a list of rendered services upon discharge, and (2) send all bills to patients within 30 business days. Further, patients may not be required to pay a bill earlier than 30 business days from the date of receipt.

Facilities and practitioners must report any bills that are sent outside of the authorized time period to the Department of Health and Human Services and must also issue refunds to the patients billed; repeated violations are subject to civil penalties.</summary>
