The Department of the Treasury must reduce the yearly U.S. contribution to a financial institution by the amount of any loans or assistance provided by the institution to a country or entity to create new capacity for fossil fuel activity during that year.\n\nFurther, the bill prohibits the United States from providing any loan, insurance, guarantee, or extension of financial or technical assistance to a country or entity for any fossil fuel activity."
