This bill permits the use of Urban Area Security Initiative or State Homeland Security Grant Program grant funds to protect a faith-based community center or vulnerable populations, including children or the elderly. A faith-based community center is a facility operated by a nonprofit faith-based community organization for the provision of recreational, social, or education services, or a house of worship.

The bill increases the term of imprisonment from 5 to 10 years for providing false or misleading information or engaging in hoaxes.</summary>
