This bill creates wildfire smoke mitigation, smoke resilient housing, and smoke resilient business grant programs.

The bill authorizes the President to provide assistance, including grants, equipment, supplies, and personnel, to any eligible state, unit of local government, or Indian tribe for the mitigation, management, and control of smoke caused by one or more wildfires.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall establish a program under which HUD shall provide grants to eligible entities (a state, an Indian tribe, a homeowner, an individual or family renting a dwelling unit or home, and an owner of a building with rental dwelling units or of a home that is rented to an individual or family) to increase the smoke resiliency of dwellings owned or occupied by vulnerable persons and pay for any associated increases in energy costs.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) shall establish a program under which the SBA shall provide grants to owners of small business concerns to increase the smoke resiliency of the business concern.</summary>
