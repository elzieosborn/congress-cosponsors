  <summary date="2020-06-12T20:21:51Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Quality Care for Nursing Home Residents and Workers During COVID-19 Act of 2020

This bill modifies several requirements for Medicare skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and Medicaid nursing facilities (NFs) during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, SNFs and NFs must comply with specified quality of care, worker safety, and transparency requirements, subject to civil penalties. Requirements include (1) testing residents and employees for COVID-19 weekly or before shifts, respectively, and reporting any lack of available testing kits on a daily basis; (2) providing at least two weeks of paid sick leave to each employee; and (3) reporting the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, including demographic information, on a daily basis.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services&#160;must also distribute funds to allow states to establish strike teams that may be deployed to SNFs and NFs within 72 hours of three or more COVID-19 diagnoses to help separate those who have been exposed, supervise testing, and ensure enforcement of whistleblower protections, among other needs. Teams must include members of the National Guard, public health officials, medical experts, and representatives of residents and workers.</summary>
