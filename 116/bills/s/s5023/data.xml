This bill suspends the authority of the Department of Education (ED) to collect student loan debt through wage garnishment until ED certifies to Congress that it has implemented a revised wage garnishment process. Further, the bill provides a right of action against employers for improper wage garnishment, and requires ED to pay a borrower whose wages were improperly garnished double the amount of those wages.</summary>
