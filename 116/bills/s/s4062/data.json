    "text": "Stopping Big Tech's Censorship Act\n\nThis bill modifies the requirements that providers and users of interactive computer services (e.g., social media companies) must meet in order to qualify for certain liability protections.\n\nSpecifically, in order to be exempt from being treated as the publisher or speaker of any information published by a third-party information content provider, a provider or user of an interactive computer service must take reasonable steps to prevent or address the unlawful use of such service or unlawful publication of information on the service.\n\nFurther, the bill removes the protection against civil liability for a provider or user of an interactive computer service that voluntarily takes action in good faith to restrict access to or availability of certain offensive material, unless such action meets specified First Amendment requirements.\n\nLastly, to be eligible for protection from liability for information published by a third-party information content provider, a provider or user of an interactive computer service must meet certain notice requirements."
