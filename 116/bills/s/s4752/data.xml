This bill establishes the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policy in the United States and sets forth its powers, duties, and membership. Among other activities, the commission must study the impacts and ongoing effects of the Indian Boarding School Policy (a federal policy under which American Indian and Alaska Native children were forcibly removed from their family homes and placed in boarding schools) and make recommendations to discontinue the removal of American Indian and Alaska Native children from their families and tribal communities by state social service departments, foster care agencies, and adoption agencies.</summary>
