This bill requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to take specified steps to increase cybersecurity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT is the extension of internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects.

By March 31, 2020, NIST must develop standards and guidelines for the appropriate use and management of IoT devices owned or controlled by the government, including minimum information security requirements for managing cybersecurity risks. The OMB shall then issue policies and principles for each agency that are consistent with such guidelines.

NIST shall publish guidelines for the reporting, coordinating, publishing, and receiving of information about a security vulnerability relating to agency information systems, including IoT devices, and the resolution of such security vulnerability. The OMB shall oversee the implementation of the guidelines.</summary>
