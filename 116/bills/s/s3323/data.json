Currently, a member may be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the credit union membership present at a special meeting.\n\nThe expelled member may request reinstatement by the credit union board.\n\nMember conduct that may be cause for expulsion includes\n\n a loss to the credit union, a violation of the credit union membership agreement, a disruption to the operations of a credit union, fraud or attempted fraud, and other illegal or inappropriate behavior."
