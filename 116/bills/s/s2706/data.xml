  <summary date="2021-04-14T19:25:23Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Heat Efficiency through Applied Technology Act or the HEAT Act

This bill addresses interconnection procedures, fees, and standards for the deployment of heat recovery technologies. (Interconnection means service to an electric consumer under which an on-site generating facility on the consumer's premises is connected to the local distribution facilities.)

Specifically, the bill directs

 the Department of Energy to establish model rules and procedures for interconnection and its associated costs, and for determining fees or rates for supplementary power, backup or standby power, maintenance power, and interruptible power supplied to facilities that operate combined heat and power technology and waste heat to power technology; and the Environmental Protection Agency to create a voluntary grant program to encourage states to update state or local air permitting procedures to incorporate output-based emission standards.</summary>
