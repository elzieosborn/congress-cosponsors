  <summary date="2020-12-10T21:23:32Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Transparent Reporting and Use of Statistics in the Transmission of Coronavirus Data Collection or the TRUST CDC Act

This bill nullifies specified guidance issued by the White House Coronavirus Task Force on July 10, 2020, concerning the reporting of state and hospital COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) data.

Specifically, states and hospitals must revert to reporting this data directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Under the task force guidance, they report it to the Department of Health and Human Services.

In addition, the CDC must reinstate, and update daily, a particular website that reported certain COVID-19 data, including the number of cases and deaths in each state.</summary>
