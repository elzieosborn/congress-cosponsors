Additionally, the bill requires the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office to coordinate technology assessment activities with the office to avoid duplication or overlapping of research activities.\n\nThe office may temporarily appoint specified technical and professional personnel to work for the office, and the office must also make the findings of completed analyses publicly available.\n\nThe bill also (1) revises the appointment of board members, (2) requires the board to hold an annual meeting at which Members of Congress may appear and present information regarding technology assessment activities, and (3) requires the board to report annually on the activities of the office."
