This bill increases the maximum amount of funding available in FY2020 for, and revises certain&#160;requirements pertaining to, temporary assistance for U.S. citizens and their dependents who are returning from foreign countries due to a crisis and are without available resources. Under current law, the Department of Health and Human Services may provide assistance such as money payments and medical care to these individuals on a temporary basis.

In providing temporary assistance during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency declared on January 31, 2020, only certain members of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service shall have direct, in-person contact with those receiving assistance. Specifically, they must be uniformed, active-duty&#160;members of the Regular Reserve Corps or the Ready Reserve Corps. In addition, they must have received&#160;training on infection prevention and control and have access to personal protective equipment.</summary>
