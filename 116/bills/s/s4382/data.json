The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) must store the statues and bust until it arranges their return to the states that provided them.\n\nAdditionally, the bill\n\n prohibits the display of statues in National Statuary Hall of persons who served as officers or voluntarily with the Confederate States of America or of the military forces or government of a state while it was in rebellion against the United States; requires the AOC to identify such statues and arrange for their transfer and delivery from the Capitol to the Smithsonian Institution; requires the Smithsonian to follow its preexisting policies and procedures regarding the storage and display of such transferred statues; requires each statue to be returned to the providing state, including its ownership, if the state requests and agrees to pay any transportation-related costs; and permits a state that has a statue removed to replace the statue."
