This bill prohibits no-knock warrants, which generally permit law enforcement officers to enter a premises without first identifying their authority and purpose.

Specifically, it requires federal law enforcement officers to provide notice of their authority and purpose before executing a warrant. State and local law enforcement agencies that receive funds from the Department of Justice must execute warrants that require the serving officer to provide notice of his or her authority and purpose before forcibly entering a premises.</summary>
