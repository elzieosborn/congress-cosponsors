This bill provides statutory authority for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to seek disgorgement (i.e., repayment) as a remedy for unjust enrichment that a person gained through a securities law violation. It also allows the SEC to seek restitution for an investor's loss as a result of a securities law violation by a person registered as or associated with a securities dealer, broker, or other specified financial advisor.

The bill establishes a 5-year statute of limitations for disgorgement and a 10-year statute of limitations for equitable remedies, including restitution.</summary>
