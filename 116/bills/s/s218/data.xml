  <summary date="2021-01-28T16:17:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Opportunities for the Nation and States to Harness Onshore Resources for Energy Act or the ONSHORE Act 

This bill addresses onshore oil and gas resources on federal land and non-federal surface estates.

The bill allows the Department of the Interior to delegate to states the authority to manage certain federal permitting and regulatory responsibilities for oil and gas development on federal lands within their borders.

The bill provides a mechanism for states to receive an increased percentage of sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals for all public land or deposits located in the state by collecting royalties directly without paying the existing administrative fees to Interior.

Certain oil and gas activities conducted on non-federal surface estates do not require a permit and are exempt from certain environmental review requirements.

Interior must defer to state regulations, guidance, and permit requirements for all activities regarding hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on federal land.

Interior must conduct a review of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska to determine what land in the reserve should be made available for oil and gas leasing.</summary>
