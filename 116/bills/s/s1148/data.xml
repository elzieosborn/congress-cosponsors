The bill also requires (1) the FAA to submit semi-annual reports to Congress on the hiring and training of air traffic controllers, (2) the FAA to give preferential consideration to applicants who gained air traffic control experience at a National Guard facility, and (3) the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation to conduct a review that assesses the assumptions and methodologies used by the FAA in developing the air traffic controller pre-employment test.</summary>
