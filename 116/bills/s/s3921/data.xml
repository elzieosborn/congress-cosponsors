This bill provides emergency funding, subject to certain limitations, for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fulfill requests from states, territories, and tribes for critical health care resources to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). FEMA and the Department of Health and Human Services must report specified information related to these requests to Congress on a weekly basis until the end of the COVID-19 emergency.

In addition, the bill directs the President to use specified authorities, including authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950, to fulfill these requests.</summary>
