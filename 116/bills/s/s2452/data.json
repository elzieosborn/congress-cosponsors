It also modifies and increases funding levels for some of these programs.\n\nThe Forest Service must award cost-share grants to states, Indian tribes, local governments, and nonprofit entities to conduct projects to reforest certain land.\n\nThe bill also establishes a civilian conservation corps to provide youth from low-income communities, indigenous communities, and communities of color with the academic, vocational, and social skills necessary to pursue long-term, productive careers in the forest sector and the wetland restoration sector.\n\nFurther, the bill sets forth a grant program for states, Indian tribes, local governments, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit entities to conduct coastal wetland restoration projects, including projects that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions."
