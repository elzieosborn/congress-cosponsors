This bill addresses education for the public and for health care providers regarding biosimilars. (Biosimilars are biological products approved by the Food and Drug Administration based on their similarity to an already approved biological product.)

The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create a website for educational materials on the meaning and use of biosimilars and interchangeable biological products.

HHS must also develop or improve continuing medical education programs for health care providers regarding biosimilars.</summary>
