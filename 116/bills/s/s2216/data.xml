The bill revises the administration of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) caregiver programs. Specifically, the bill requires the VA to report on the feasibility and advisability of formally recognizing caregivers of veterans by identifying them in the veteran's electronic health record. Such caregivers covered by the bill include those approved as a provider of personal care services under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and those participating in the Program of General Caregiver Support Services. If the VA determines that formally recognizing caregivers is feasible and advisable, it must implement recognition.

The bill requires the VA to use standardized letters to notify veterans, their caregivers, and applicants for the program regarding decisions affecting the furnishing of assistance under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Such notifications must contain specified details regarding the decision.

The bill also authorizes the VA to extend benefits for a 90-day period under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, including the monthly personal caregiver stipend, after determining that a veteran is no longer eligible for the program solely because of improvement in their condition. The effective date of discharge from the program shall not be earlier than 60 days after the date on which the VA provides notice of the lack of eligibility.</summary>
