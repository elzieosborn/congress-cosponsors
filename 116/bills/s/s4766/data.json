    "text": "Chai Suthammanont Remembrance Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires federal agencies to develop and disclose reopening plans that incorporate certain information before sending employees back to work during a public health emergency, such as the emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires an agency to post a reopening plan on its website at least 30 days before reopening a facility. Among other information, the plan must detail (1) the personal protective equipment (PPE) that the agency will provide to its employees; (2) protections for employees whose work requires them to be in nonfederal buildings, such as auditors; and (3) potential measures to reverse the reopening that still ensure the continuity of operations.\n\nEach agency's Office of the Inspector General must report on whether the agency has complied with this bill's requirements and whether the agency has provided adequate PPE for its employees."
