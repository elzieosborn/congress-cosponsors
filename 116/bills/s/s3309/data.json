Specifically, HHS must, upon determination of a public health emergency, convene a group of federal officials to prepare monthly reports concerning such matters as funding, collaboration, and best practices. The GAO must (1) report on, among other topics, the capacity of the public health system to respond effectively to infectious disease outbreaks and how funds for public health emergencies have been expended within the last two years; and (2) issue a post-emergency report on response efforts by government entities."
