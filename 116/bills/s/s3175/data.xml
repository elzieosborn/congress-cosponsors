This bill revises and permanently reauthorizes the Intelligent Transportation Systems Advisory Committee of the Department of Transportation (DOT).

DOT must create, publish, and maintain a resource guide that is designed to assist states and local communities in developing and implementing intelligent transportation technology or smart community transportation programs.

The bill designates at least 10 consortia of public institutions of higher education as Centers of Excellence in Advanced Transportation Workforce Training that must seek to expand their capacity to train students for career opportunities in industry and government service related to the use of intelligent transportation technologies and systems, including by establishing new career pathways from secondary school to associate degree and baccalaureate degree programs.

DOT must carry out a program to award grants to certain entities for projects that support (1) the education and recruitment of technical workers for the intelligent transportation technologies and systems industry; and (2) the development of a workforce skilled in various types of intelligent transportation technologies, components, infrastructure, and equipment.

The Government Accountability Office must conduct a study that identifies issues relating to workforce development in intelligent and zero-emissions transportation technology, including any shortages of skilled employees in those fields.</summary>
