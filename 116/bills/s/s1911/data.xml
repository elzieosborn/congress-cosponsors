The Department of Labor must award grants to states to provide for subgrants to certain sector partnerships or labor-management partnerships. Priority must be given to sector partnerships or labor-management partnerships that (1) demonstrate they will prepare the local workforce for employment in growing in-demand industry sectors or occupations, and (2) target low-income individuals.

In addition, Labor must also maintain a CareerOneStop website that contains, among other things (1) an Upskill Account Portal for eligible individuals to request such accounts, and (2) lists of approved training providers.</summary>
