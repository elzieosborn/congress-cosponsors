This bill directs the Department of Labor to convene an interagency working group to develop recommendations to address the workforce needs of the telecommunications industry.

Labor shall establish and issue guidance on how states can address the workforce needs of the telecommunications industry, including guidance on how a state workforce development board can (1) utilize federal resources available to states to meet the workforce needs of the telecommunications industry; and (2) promote and improve recruitment in qualified industry-led workforce development programs, including the Telecommunications Industry Registered Apprenticeship Program and other industry-recognized apprenticeship programs.

The Government Accountability Office must submit to Congress a report that estimates the number of skilled telecommunications workers that will be required to build and maintain (1) broadband infrastructure in rural areas; and (2) the 5G wireless infrastructure needed to support 5G wireless technology.</summary>
