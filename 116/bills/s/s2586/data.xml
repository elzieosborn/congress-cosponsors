Specifically, grants must be used to (1) develop best practices to reduce preventable maternal mortality, (2) train health care professionals to reduce and prevent adiscrimination when providing maternal health services, and (3) support the collaboration of professionals across health settings with respect to maternal health. Grants may also be used to establish evidence-informed, integrated health care services to pregnant and postpartum women and their infants. HHS also must contract with an independent research organization to study and make recommendations about best practices for reducing and preventing discrimination in the provision of maternal health services and meet certain reporting requirements for specified maternal and child health care grant programs.</summary>
