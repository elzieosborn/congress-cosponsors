The Department of Health and Human Services may make an exception to this requirement if convening a meeting would not be in the public interest.\n\nTo receive an emergency authorization, the product sponsor must agree to seek FDA market approval for the vaccine within a certain time period.\n\nAfter an emergency authorization, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices shall report recommendations regarding the vaccine to Congress and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
