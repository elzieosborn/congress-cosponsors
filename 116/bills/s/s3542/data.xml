This bill sets forth a special rule for determining the amount of the earned income tax credit and the refundable portion of the child tax credit. Specifically, the bill allows a taxpayer to use the earned income of the preceding taxable year in computing such credits if such income is greater than the income for the current taxable year (i..e., 2020).</summary>
