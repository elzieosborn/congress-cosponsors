Currently, an alien shall be inadmissible if the alien seeks to enter the United States to engage in such an action.\n\nFurthermore, the bill expands these grounds of inadmissibility and other security-related grounds to cover the spouse or child of the barred alien if the act occurred in the last five years.\n\nThe bill also modifies the authority of the Department of Justice to waive certain security-related grounds of inadmissibility for an alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa."
