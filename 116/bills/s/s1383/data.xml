  <summary date="2019-10-30T21:49:06Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill addresses the process of business registration by a spouse accompanying a service member deployed away from the state of residence.

 The accompanying spouse shall not be deemed to have (1) lost a residence or domicile in the state, (2) acquired a residence or domicile in another state, or (3) become a resident in or of any other state. The spouse may elect to use the same residence as the member regardless of the date of marriage.

The bill authorizes the Department of Defense to enter into an agreement with the Council of State Governments to assist with funding for interstate compacts on licensed occupations in order to alleviate burdens associated with relicensing when members make a permanent change of duty station to another state.</summary>
