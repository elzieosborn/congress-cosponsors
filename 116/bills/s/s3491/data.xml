  <summary date="2020-03-30T14:24:25Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Job Protection for Quarantined Individuals Act of 2020 This bill prohibits employers from taking adverse actions (e.g., terminating, disciplining, threatening, or penalizing) against employees who are unable to work because the employee is or has been (1) quarantined, (2) in isolation, or (3) caring for a family member in isolation or quarantine. Such isolation or quarantine may be due to (1) a regulation by the Office of the Surgeon General concerning the spread of a communicable disease; (2) an order by a state, local, or tribal government; (3) a written recommendation by such government; or (4) voluntary health monitoring pursuant to guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other applicable public health agency. Employees may enforce this prohibition through civil claims to recover damages and reinstatement of employment, if appropriate. The Department of Labor also may conduct administrative actions and file civil claims on behalf of employees.</summary>
