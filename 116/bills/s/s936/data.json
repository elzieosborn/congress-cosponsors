FISA warrants shall only be for items specifically identified in the FBI's application to access the records.\n\nFISA currently allows the FBI to apply for a warrant to access records and other documents to obtain foreign intelligence information or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The application for such a warrant is ex parte before courts designated under FISA, meaning that the government is the only party present in the proceedings."
