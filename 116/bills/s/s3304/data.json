The Department of Agriculture (USDA) must use amounts in the fund to provide grants for the conservation of such butterflies.\n\nIn addition, USDA must transfer amounts from the fund to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to implement the Western Monarch Butterfly Conservation Plan, which was prepared by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies."
