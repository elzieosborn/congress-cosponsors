The bill specifies procedures for Congress and the heads of agencies to analyze, review, and recommend whether the waiver or modification of a rule should continue and such waiver or modification expires only if a law is enacted in accordance with a recommendation that the rule be reinstated when the emergency period ends.\n\nAdditionally, the bill exempts certain meat slaughter and preparation facilities from federal inspection requirements if the facility (1) operates in accordance with the laws of the state in which the facility is located, and (2) prepares meat products exclusively for distribution for consumption by consumers within the state in which the facility is located."
