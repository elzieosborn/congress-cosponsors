Additionally, the President must sanction (1) any foreign person who sells to, or purchases from, China any covered item; and (2) any Chinese person who knowingly uses a covered item provided to them in violation of U.S. export control law.\n\nIn addition to a specified list of industries subject to the bill, the USTR must identify products manufactured or produced in, or exported from, China that either receive certain support from China or are used by China to violate human rights or religious liberties."
