    "text": "Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act\n\nThis bill requires private health insurance plans to cover (1) specified infertility treatments (e.g., in vitro fertilization), if the plan also covers obstetrical services; and (2) fertility preservation services for individuals who undergo medically necessary treatment that may cause impairment of fertility.\n\nPrivate health insurance plans must apply cost sharing for such services that does not exceed the amount for similar services covered by the plan. Further, plans are prohibited from (1) providing incentives for plan holders to forego infertility treatment, or (2) reducing the reimbursement rate to providers of such treatments.\n\nThe bill also extends infertility treatment and fertility preservation coverage to Medicaid enrollees, federal employees, members of the military, and veterans."
