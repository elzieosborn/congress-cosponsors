The center shall establish and implement a program to provide grants and forgivable loans to support investment in advanced manufacturing for the domestic production of critical drugs, medical devices, and active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nFurthermore, a supplemental application for a critical drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may receive expedited review if, among other requirements, the applicant plans to produce the drug domestically after the approval of the supplemental application. (A supplemental application generally involves a change, such as a manufacturing change, to an existing application for FDA approval.)\n\nThe bill also authorizes HHS and the Department of Defense to enter into multiyear high-volume contracts to purchase critical drugs and medical devices."
