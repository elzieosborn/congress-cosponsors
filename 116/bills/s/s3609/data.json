    "text": "Coronavirus Immigrant Families Protection Act\n\nThis bill addresses immigration issues related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and otherwise makes changes to certain COVID-19 response activities, benefits, and programs.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) must temporarily limit in-person immigration proceedings, and, during the COVID-19 emergency, DHS, DOJ, and the Department of State shall not take certain adverse immigration actions. In addition, an individual's use of certain assistance related to COVID-19 may not be considered in current or future immigration determinations concerning that individual.\n\nThe bill includes pandemics within the scope of specified disaster and emergency laws and modifies nutrition and other benefits during such emergencies. For example, states may receive Medicaid payments for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and treatment for certain unlawful aliens, and individuals who use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number may receive cash assistance related to the COVID-19 response. In addition, individuals may not be excluded from participating in COVID-19 response programs due to actual or perceived immigration status.\n\nTo ensure the availability of information related to COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must (1) establish programs for eligible community-based organizations to develop preparedness materials that are culturally and linguistically appropriate, and (2) translate materials and operate telephone hotlines in specified languages. Agencies that receive funding under a law enacted in response to COVID-19 must also provide information about programs and opportunities in such languages."
