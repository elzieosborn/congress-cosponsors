  <summary date="2021-08-19T12:40:52Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Continuing the Paycheck Protection Program Act

This bill establishes funding for, expands, and provides additional economic assistance to small businesses in response to COVID-19.

Specifically, the Small Business Administration is authorized to provide second draw loans of up to $2 million under the Paycheck Protection Program. A recipient shall be eligible for forgiveness of a second draw loan in the same manner as an initial paycheck protection loan.

Further the bill modifies the Paycheck Protection Program by, among other things, (1) expanding forgivable expenses, (2) allowing borrowers to select an eight-week period to use their paycheck protection loan, (3) simplifying the forgiveness application for smaller loans, (4) expanding eligibility to certain chambers of commerce and destination marketing organizations, and (5) establishing a specific loan calculation for farmers and ranchers.</summary>
