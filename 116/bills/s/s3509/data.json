    "text": "This bill suspends foreclosures and establishes a forbearance program for certain federally backed mortgages during the coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19) outbreak and other disasters.\n\nSpecifically, during the coronavirus outbreak or in an area where another disaster has been declared, a federally backed mortgage servicer is (1) prohibited from initiating a foreclosure, and (2) must suspend any foreclosure procedures. These requirements are lifted 180 days after such a declaration.\n\nBorrowers experiencing financial hardships due to the coronavirus outbreak or other disaster may request a forbearance on their federally backed mortgage payment for 180 days, which may be extended for an additional 180 days at the borrower's request. A servicer may not charge fees, interest, or other penalties in connection with the forbearance. Before the end of the forbearance period, a servicer must evaluate a borrower's ability to make regular mortgage payments. If the borrower is unable to return to making regular payments, the servicer must evaluate the borrower for certain loan modification options."
