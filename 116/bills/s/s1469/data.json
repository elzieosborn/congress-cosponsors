    "text": "Prevention of Foreign Interference with Elections Act of 2019\n\nThis bill establishes new criminal penalties and revises certain prohibitions related to the interference of elections by foreign nationals.\n\nSpecifically, the bill establishes a new criminal offense for conspiring with a foreign national to interfere with an election. A violator is subject to criminal penalties\u2014a fine, a prison term of up to five years, or both.\n\nFurther, a person who conspires with an agent of a foreign power to interfere with an election is subject to criminal penalties\u2014a fine, a prison term of up to 10 years, or both.\n\nIn addition, an alien that engages in election interference is inadmissible into the United States. However, the Department of Homeland Security may waive this prohibition if the alien receives an adjustment of status for assisting in certain criminal prosecutions.\n\nThe bill also (1) expands the prohibition on a foreign national making an expenditure or disbursement for an electioneering communication; and (2) prohibits an individual from knowingly providing substantial assistance to foreign governments or foreign political parties, such as by making an expenditure or disbursement for an electioneering communication."
