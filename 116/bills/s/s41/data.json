The BLM shall only approve the survey, or a portion of it, that has the written approval of the offices and each affected tribe.\n\nSurveys of individual parcels in the affected area shall be conducted according to the requirements for the survey of the South Bank boundary line.\n\nAfter a survey for an individual parcel has been approved, the offices shall\n\n publish a notice of the approval of such survey, and furnish to any landowner a copy of such survey and any field notes related to the parcel of that landowner."
