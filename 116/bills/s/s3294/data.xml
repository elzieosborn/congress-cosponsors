This bill directs U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to ensure that various naturalization-related services are available at a U.S. port of entry, embassy, or consulate that is accessible to noncitizen veterans. Specifically, USCIS must ensure that naturalization examinations, biometric collections, and naturalization ceremonies are available at such locations for noncitizen veterans.

Such services must be available to a noncitizen veteran who has been removed from the United States or is inadmissible.</summary>
