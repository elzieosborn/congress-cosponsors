This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) to study, and make certain recommendations concerning, the use of health impact assessments or other tools to evaluate the effect of proposed federal legislation on health and health disparities.

When developing recommendations to incorporate these tools into the federal legislative process, the National Academies must consult with the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Research Service.</summary>
