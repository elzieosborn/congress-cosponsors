CISA shall develop and submit to Congress (1) a strategy to utilize information collected for countering malicious cyber activity; (2) an outreach strategy to local, tribal, and territorial governments and other publicly controlled entities to inform and support migration to the .gov domain; (3) a .gov domain security enhancement strategy and implementation plan; and (4) the development, assessment, and determination of the amount of any fees imposed on new .gov domain registrants or annual renewals of .gov domains.\n\nThe bill allows recipients of State Homeland Security grants or Urban Area Security Initiative grants to use grant funds for migrating any online service to the .gov domain."
