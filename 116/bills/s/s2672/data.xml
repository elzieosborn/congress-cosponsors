This bill requires certain federal agencies, including 10 departments, to be abolished or relocated outside the National Capital region. The bill designates a state for the new location of each department.

The Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration must, for each agency, develop a proposal to relocate the agency to an area that has experienced economic distress. Relocation proposals must include three proposed locations in one state. Locations may not be within 30 miles of a city that has a population of more than 800,000.

States may select a location for a relocating agency from the proposed locations.

 The bill requires relocations to take place within 10 years of the selection of a location and provides penalties for failure to relocate.

Federal courts are denied jurisdiction over a case or controversy in which a party challenges a selection or action taken under this bill.</summary>
