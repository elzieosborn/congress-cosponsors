Under the bill, VHA personnel who verify credentials for appointees, review qualifications for such persons, or hire such persons must undergo periodic training to review relevant law and policy regarding provider qualifications for VHA employment.\n\nThe bill requires the VHA to enroll health care appointees in continuous query of their record within the National Practitioner Data Bank. The VHA must also develop and implement a mechanism for monitoring the continuous query and updating information within the VA's credentialing system.\n\nAt least once a year, the VHA must audit its appointed health care employees who have an adverse action reported on the National Practitioner Data Bank."
