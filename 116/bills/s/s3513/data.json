Specifically, the bill repeals divisions of the Family First Coronavirus Response Act that (1) expand emergency family and medical leave, (2) provide emergency paid sick leave, and (3) the establish payroll tax credits for such emergency paid leave. The bill requires employers to grant at least 1 hour of accrued paid sick time to each employee for every 30 hours worked, up to a minimum of 56 hours, or 7 days, for use under specified circumstances. Further, employees are immediately entitled to up to 14 days of additional paid sick time if a public-health emergency is declared. The bill also reimburses the employers of individuals who use accrued or additional sick time under these provisions. Additionally, the bill establishes a family and medical leave insurance benefit program to provide up to 60 days of partially-paid leave for qualifying circumstances including to care for a specified close relative with a serious health condition. The bill establishes a trust to pay benefits under the program, which is funded by an employer payroll tax and employee income tax."
