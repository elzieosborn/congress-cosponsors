An employee is considered eligible if the employee has not received specified disciplinary action and is otherwise determined eligible by the agency.\n\nAdditionally, the Office of Personnel Management must, in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services, develop an expansive telework policy for use in future outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\nThe bill also requires executive agencies to ensure that all new managers and supervisors receive certain training on specified aspects of telework, including the benefits of telework, the technology involved, and information security."
