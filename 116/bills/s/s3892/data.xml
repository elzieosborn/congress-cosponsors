This bill makes certain Hong Kong residents eligible for asylum status. To qualify, an individual must have the right of abode in Hong Kong since birth and must have maintained continuous residency in Hong Kong since birth.

Under this bill, an otherwise qualified individual shall not be denied asylum due to a politically motivated adverse government action, such as an arrest, against the applicant.

The Department of State shall report to Congress a strategy for providing assistance to other countries offering to provide migration services and asylum to eligible Hong Kong permanent residents.</summary>
