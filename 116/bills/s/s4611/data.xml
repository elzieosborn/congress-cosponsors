This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a program to address the effects of the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic on state and local fairs.

In carrying out the program, USDA may provide competitive grants to states (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United States).

A state may only use grant funds provided under the program to assist a state agricultural agency to address cost coverage issues related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on state and local fairs, including by identifying opportunities to provide virtual education and entertainment related to agriculture.</summary>
