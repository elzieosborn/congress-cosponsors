This bill expands revenue requirements currently applicable only to proprietary (i.e., for-profit) institutions of higher education (IHEs) to all IHEs.

Under current law, proprietary IHEs may not receive more than 90% of their revenue from federally funded student aid (known as the 90/10 rule). The bill applies this rule to all IHEs.</summary>
