This bill directs the Department of Education to establish three grant programs to increase enrollment and performance of underrepresented students in advanced courses and programs. Local educational agencies receiving grants or subgrants must use such funds for certain activities, such as conducting community engagement, expanding enrollment of underrepresented students in advanced courses, and providing direct services (e.g., tutoring) to underrepresented students.</summary>
