  <summary date="2020-10-19T14:21:22Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Access to Breast Cancer Diagnosis Act of 2020

This bill prohibits private health insurance plans from imposing higher cost-sharing requirements on breast cancer diagnostic examinations than initial breast cancer screening examinations. Diagnostic examinations are generally required after an initial screening detects an abnormality and typically require additional mammogram images (e.g., x-rays).</summary>
