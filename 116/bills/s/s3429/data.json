USDA must establish a goals and assessment process for conservation programs that includes (1) the identification of natural resource and environmental objectives, outcomes, and results for the programs; (2) assessments of the resulting changes in the status and conditions of natural resources and the environment; and (3) a monitoring and evaluation process for the programs and initiatives.\n\nIn implementing the monitoring and evaluation process, USDA must use certain funds provided for conservation programs and establish a National Technical Committee.\n\nThe bill also sets forth reporting requirements regarding the progress conservation programs have made in achieving the objectives and outcomes."
