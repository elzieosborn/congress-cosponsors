The bill prohibits agencies from finalizing the following proposed rules:\n\n the Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Review proposed rule issued by the EPA; the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicle Rules for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks proposed rule issued by the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and the Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for General Service Incandescent Lamps proposed determination issued by DOE. Finally, the bill nullifies a rescission of a waiver granted to California to enforce standards, which are more stringent than federal standards, for air pollution emissions from vehicles."
