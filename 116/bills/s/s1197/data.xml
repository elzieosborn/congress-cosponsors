This bill establishes a tax credit for contractors that construct new all-electric homes.

The credit applies to new homes that

 are constructed by the contractor, are acquired by a person from the contractor for use as a residence during the year, have appliances and mechanical systems that are powered solely by electricity, do not have a gas line or gas service, and meet specified energy efficiency standards. For a single-family residence, the credit is equal to $5,000. For a multi-family residence, the credit is equal to $1,750, multiplied by the total number of residential units.</summary>
