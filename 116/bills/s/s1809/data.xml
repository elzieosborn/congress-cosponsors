This bill terminates a declaration of national&#160;emergency made by the President after 72 hours unless Congress enacts a joint resolution to renew the declaration. It also bars subsequent presidential declarations of emergency during the remainder of a presidential term of office based on the same circumstances if Congress does not enact a resolution of approval.

Under the bill, an emergency declaration that is approved by Congress expires 90 days after the issuance of the presidential declaration of emergency unless renewed.

The bill exempts presidential powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) from the requirements of this bill.

The bill also (1) repeals presidential authority to unilaterally control communications, including the internet, cell phone service, and television and radio broadcasts; and (2) terminates all existing national emergency declarations that do not specify IEEPA as the source of presidential authority.</summary>
