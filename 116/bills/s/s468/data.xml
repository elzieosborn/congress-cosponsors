This bill revises the Teacher Quality Partnership Grant Program, which provides training and professional development opportunities for prospective and new teachers through partnerships between (1) high-need school districts, schools, or early childhood education programs; and (2) institutions of higher education. The bill expands the grant program to include training and professional development opportunities for principals and other school leaders. In addition, the bill expands the types of entities that may join the partnerships and obtain grant funding to include entities that are nonprofit educational organizations or entities operating programs that provide alternative routes to state certification of teachers or school leaders.</summary>
