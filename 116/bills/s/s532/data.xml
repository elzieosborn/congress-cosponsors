This bill modifies the qualifying service requirement of the teacher loan forgiveness program for certain military spouses who have student federal loans.

Under current law, an otherwise qualified full-time teacher must complete five consecutive years of service to be eligible for the teacher loan forgiveness program. This bill permits a teacher who completes five full-time years of nonconsecutive service to be eligible for loan forgiveness if the teacher's spouse was relocated by the military.</summary>
