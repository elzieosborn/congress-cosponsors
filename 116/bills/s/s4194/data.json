    "text": "National Institute of Manufacturing Act\n\nThis bill establishes the National Institute of Manufacturing to serve as the central hub for federal manufacturing programs, and it directs the institute to coordinate such programs across agencies through a national strategic plan for manufacturing.\n\nThe institute shall, among other things, (1) convene key stakeholders to develop a national strategic plan for manufacturing in the United States that identifies the needs and priorities of the U.S. manufacturing sector; (2) support and incentivize manufacturing-focused research, collaboration, and education; and (3) be the primary federal entity for all decisions related to manufacturing.\n\nOverseen by a Chief Manufacturing Officer, the institute shall be composed of various directorates (e.g., a Directorate for Technology Development and a Directorate for Trade), and the functions of specified federal manufacturing programs and offices shall be transferred to the institute and its directorates.\n\nThe bill also permanently reauthorizes the U.S. Manufacturing Council of the International Trade Administration as the National Manufacturing Council, and it tasks the council with (1) ensuring regular communication between the federal government and the U.S. manufacturing sector, (2) advising the institute's Chief Manufacturing Officer on government policies and programs that affect U.S. manufacturing, and (3) ensuring the U.S. remains the leading destination for investment in manufacturing throughout the world.\n\nLastly, the bill requires the Chief Manufacturing Officer to establish the manufacturing.gov hub, a section of the Department of Commerce's website that shall serve as the primary point for information relating to every federal manufacturing program."
