Among other things, the plans must establish how the agencies intend to increase the capacity of HBCUs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.\n\nThe agencies must provide technical assistance and information to the White House Initiative on HBCUs to enhance communication with HBCUs concerning their program activities and initiatives as well as applications for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.\n\nIn addition, the bill provides statutory authority for the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs."
