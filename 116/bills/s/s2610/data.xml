This bill reauthorizes through FY2031 certain energy grant programs and otherwise revises the activities of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs within the Department of Energy.

Specifically, the office must

 consider the fiscal ability of an Indian tribe, intertribal organization, or tribal energy development organization to meet cost-sharing requirements for energy projects; give priority to partnering with state and local organizations when providing technical assistance to tribes; designate a liaison to ensure that tribes are aware of federal grants and funding opportunities; and develop an energy strategy for tribes in the Arctic to address climate change. The bill also authorizes the office to provide grants for providing or expanding electricity to the homes of members of tribes that are acquired, constructed, or improved with federal funds. Currently, such grants may only be used to provide electricity on Indian land.</summary>
