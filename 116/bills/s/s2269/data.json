It prohibits new construction or major renovation of certain executive agency headquarters in the Washington Metropolitan area.\n\nThe General Services Administration (GSA) must (1) establish a process to allow an executive agency to request GSA to issue a solicitation for the relocation of its headquarters; (2) allow any state to submit a proposal for the relocation of the agency's headquarters; and (3) in consultation with the executive agency, select a state for the relocation of the agency's headquarters using a competitive bidding procedure based on certain considerations."
