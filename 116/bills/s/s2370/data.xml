This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to (1) require certain employers who do not maintain qualifying retirement plans or arrangements to make available to their eligible employees a payroll deposit individual retirement account (IRA) arrangement (automatic IRA arrangement) which grants such employees the right to opt-out of participation, (2) require the Department of the Treasury to provide employers with a model notice for notifying employees of their opportunity to participate in an automatic IRA arrangement and for providing details regarding the election period, (3) impose a penalty on employers who fail to provide eligible employees access to an automatic IRA arrangement, (4) allow employers who do not have more than 100 employees a tax credit for costs associated with establishing an automatic IRA arrangement, and (5) increase the dollar limitation on the tax credit for small employer pension plan startup costs.</summary>
