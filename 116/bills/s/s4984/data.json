The CDC shall periodically report to Congress a summary of this data and an analysis of the trends and pattern of the spread of the disease.\n\nICE, CPB, and ORR shall also ensure that each detained individual receives all medical records related to any COVID-19 test administered to the individual.\n\nICE, CPB, and ORR shall also report to Congress on (1) the COVID-19 safety protocols in their facilities, and (2) their efforts to ensure that each detained individual has access to legal counsel.\n\nThis bill's data collection and reporting requirements that apply to ICE, CPB, and ORR shall also apply to any contract facilities that they use to hold detained individuals."
