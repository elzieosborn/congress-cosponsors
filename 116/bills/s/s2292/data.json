    "text": "Asylum Abuse Reduction Act\n\nThis bill places restrictions on aliens seeking asylum and contains provisions related to immigration enforcement.\n\nUnder this bill, an asylum seeker who arrives at a U.S. land port of entry without entry documents may not be admitted unless an asylum officer at a U.S. consulate or embassy has interviewed the alien in person and concluded that the alien (1) has been persecuted in the alien's country of origin due to race, religion, or other characteristics; or (2) would be tortured upon return to that country. (Currently, an alien arriving at a port of entry may apply for asylum, and an immigration officer there typically will give the alien a credible fear interview.)\n\nFurthermore, an alien who traveled through a third country to enter the United States through the southern border shall be ineligible for asylum unless (1) the alien has applied for and been denied asylum or protection in that third country, (2) the alien was a victim of severe human trafficking, or (3) the third country is not party to certain international agreements relating to refugees.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security shall establish an alternatives to detention pilot program available to aliens who (1) certify that they will comply with all immigration proceedings, (2) agree to only a single appeal of an immigration judge decision, and (3) sign a privacy waiver.\n\nEach federal judicial district shall appoint at least one magistrate judge to issue arrest warrants for individuals violating orders to depart, upon a showing of probable cause."
