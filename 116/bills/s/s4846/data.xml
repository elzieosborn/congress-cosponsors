This bill establishes several requirements for skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, and assisted living facilities to address the outbreak of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

Specifically, the bill requires these facilities to establish crisis plans and to maintain at least a 30-day supply of personal protective equipment to respond to the outbreak. The bill also incorporates a memorandum from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services about new regulations that require skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities to report COVID-19 cases to residents, families, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the requirements took effect May 8, 2020).</summary>
