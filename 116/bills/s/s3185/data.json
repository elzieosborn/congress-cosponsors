Any funds intended to be awarded as incentive fees that are not paid due to the inability of a contractor to meet the criteria established by this bill shall be deobligated and made available for purposes for which the funds are otherwise allowable.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury shall include award fee as a filter on USAspending.gov."
