This bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish the position of Domestic Agriculture Supply Chain Administrator.

The Administrator must

 carry out activities in the interest of assisting farmers in entering their products into the domestic market; act as a liaison to connect farmers with food banks, schools, grocers, restaurants, and nonprofit organizations to expand domestic market access for organizations that are in need of agricultural products; identify barriers, either regulatory or legal, that prevent or inhibit farmers from entering their products into the domestic market through food distribution networks or other entities; and make recommendations to USDA regarding the means by which to remove such barriers. Additionally, USDA must establish a catalog or data resource that is capable of recording (1) farms that have excess agricultural products, and (2) food distribution organizations that are in need of certain agricultural products.</summary>
