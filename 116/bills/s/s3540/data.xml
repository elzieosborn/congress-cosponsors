This bill revises provisions related to stock buybacks.

An issuer of securities may not purchase its own securities on a national exchange if the issuer has (1) received specified financial assistance related to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, and (2) repurchased more than $1 billion worth of its own securities in the last five years. Additionally, one-third of such issuer's&#160;board of directors&#160;must be&#160;elected by employees for the issuer to be allowed&#160;to register securities.

The bill also repeals the Securities and Exchange Commission regulation (Rule 10b-18) that generally provides a safe harbor from market manipulation liability for an issuer engaging in a stock buyback.</summary>
