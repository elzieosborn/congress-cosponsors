    "text": "Strengthening the Public Health Workforce Act\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2025, and otherwise modifies, the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program (a program that awards student loan repayment to individuals with qualifying degrees who commit to work full-time for a federal, state, tribal, or local public health agency for a period of obligated service). Among other changes, the bill eliminates the option for individuals to complete the service obligation in a federal public health agency and expands the scope of qualifying degrees to include those in statistics, computer science, and programs related to information technology.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Health and Human Services may take actions to equitably distribute awards among geographic regions and jurisdictional levels and to ensure that at least 50% of individuals who receive loan repayment awards are not employed in qualifying public health agencies at the time they enter the program."
