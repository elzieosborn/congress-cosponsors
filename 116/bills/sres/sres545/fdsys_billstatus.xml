        <text><![CDATA[ <p>This resolution affirms the Senate's commitment to abide by domestic and international legal obligations to protect refugees and to recognize the importance of the refugee resettlement program as a function of U.S. global leadership. Further, it calls upon the U.S. government to (1) provide funding for refugee protection and resettlement, (2) work with the international community to find solutions to existing conflicts and prevent new conflicts from beginning, and (3) ensure the U.S. refugee resettlement program is equipped to protect and support refugees.</p>]]></text>
