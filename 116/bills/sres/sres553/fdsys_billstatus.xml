        <text><![CDATA[ <p>This resolution condemns the Chinese government's response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, including China's censorship of doctors and journalists during the early days of the outbreak and its refusal to accept assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The resolution also calls for (1) China to publicly state that there is&nbsp;no evidence that COVID-19 originated from outside China, and (2) the World Health Organization to retract misleading statements of support&nbsp;for China's response to COVID-19.</p>]]></text>
