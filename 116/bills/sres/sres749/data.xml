  <summary date="2020-11-05T16:20:54Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution denounces efforts by the Nicol&#225;s Maduro regime to hold fraudulent legislative elections and joins members of the international community in rejecting the regime's efforts to carry out those elections. Further, it urges that elections in Venezuela be conducted as soon as possible according to international standards for free, fair, and transparent electoral processes.

Additionally, the resolution calls on the Maduro regime to cease its persecution of Venezuala's independent political parties and release all political prisoners, and it calls for Nicol&#225;s Maduro and senior members of his regime to be held accountable for their actions.</summary>
