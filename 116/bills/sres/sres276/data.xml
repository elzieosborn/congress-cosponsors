Leiomyosarcoma is a type of sarcoma that arises from smooth muscle tissue, most commonly originating in the uterus, stomach, intestine, or blood vessels.)

The resolution also recognizes the challenges faced by sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma patients and commends the dedication of organizations, volunteers, researchers, and caregivers working to improve the quality of life of sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma patients and their families.</summary>
