  <summary date="2020-06-23T17:26:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution condemns violence committed against people of the United States exercising their right to free speech and peaceful assembly, including journalists, and reaffirms the Senate's commitment to freedom of the press and peaceful assembly as pillars of democracy.

The resolution calls on local, state, and federal authorities to take steps to ensure that members of the media are able to safely perform their duties without interference, censorship, threats of violence, or physical harm and to explicitly exempt the news media from any curfew regulations.

The resolution calls on authorities and officials to (1) identify and thoroughly investigate instances in which government officials or members of police forces have restricted media access to the demonstrations or where violence was perpetrated against members of the media, and (2) ensure that such perpetrators are appropriately disciplined and charged.</summary>
