  <summary date="2020-06-19T22:52:48Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This resolution makes it out of order in the Senate to consider any measure or matter until one session day has passed since introduction for every 20 pages included in the measure or matter, plus one session day for any number of remaining pages less than 20.

The resolution allows any Senator to raise a point of order that the consideration of any measure or matter is not in order if not enough days have passed since introduction. The point of order may be waived or suspended only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Senators.</summary>
