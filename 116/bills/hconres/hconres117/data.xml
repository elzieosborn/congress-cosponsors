  <summary date="2021-01-20T18:35:28Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution calls on the President to abandon the One China Principle in favor of a policy that recognizes Taiwan as an independent country. The resolution also urges the President to bolster diplomatic and economic relations between the United States and Taiwan through specified means.

(Taiwan is self-governing, but China considers it to be a renegade province and has taken actions to encourage countries and international organizations to limit or cut off relations with Taiwan.)</summary>
