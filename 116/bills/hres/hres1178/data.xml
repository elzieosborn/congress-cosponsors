  <summary date="2020-11-04T19:14:02Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution supports reauthorizing the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) but opposes any inclusion of apparel, textile, and footwear products in the GSP. Further, it recognizes that including apparel, textiles, and footwear in the GSP would be detrimental to certain imports to the United States and to jobs that depend on the trade generated by those imports.</summary>
