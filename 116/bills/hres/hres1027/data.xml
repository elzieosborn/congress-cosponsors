  <summary date="2020-07-01T19:16:18Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that

 the harm, trauma, and deaths of black women must be recognized alongside those of black men; the position of black women is unique in this country and therefore deserves specific, focused intervention to bring about equality of access, opportunity, and justice; any legislation passed in the House to remedy racial inequities, especially those in the criminal justice system, must include reforms to address concerns for black women; and the creation of a commission to study the status of black women and girls would aid in reducing social and systemic barriers and identifying reforms that would encourage more fair and equal treatment.</summary>
