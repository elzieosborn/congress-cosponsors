  <summary date="2020-02-21T13:28:21Z" status="Passed House">This resolution establishes budget enforcement procedures in the House of Representatives for FY2020.

Specifically, the resolution establishes requirements for

 committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, aggregate revenue levels, and limitations on advance appropriations. (An advance appropriation is new discretionary budget authority that is provided in FY2020 appropriations legislation and first becomes available after FY2020.)

The resolution also specifies requirements for adjusting the allocations and levels to accommodate specified funding for

 Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement activities, and the 2020 census.</summary>
