  <summary date="2021-07-16T16:51:04Z" status="Passed House">This resolution sets forth considerations for the House of Representatives in guiding the national artificial intelligence strategy.

Specifically, the resolution, among other things, expresses the sense of the House that

 the United States should take a global leadership role in artificial intelligence; the national competitiveness of the United States in artificial intelligence would benefit from increased funding for federal programs that support science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science education; the United States should leverage its alliances to promote democratic principles, foster research collaboration, and develop common standards with respect to artificial intelligence; and the federal government should increase investments in artificial intelligence research and development and related fields.</summary>
