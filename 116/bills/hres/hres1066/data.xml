  <summary date="2020-09-02T14:09:20Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution addresses issues related to individuals with disabilities.

Specifically, the resolution

 recognizes the importance of independent living for individuals with disabilities made possible by the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and encourages all Americans to celebrate the advancement of inclusion and equitable opportunities made possible by its enactment; pledges to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to identify and address the remaining barriers that undermine the national goals of equality of opportunity, independent living, economic self-sufficiency, and full participation for individuals with disabilities; pledges to work with states to increase access to home- and community-based services for individuals with disabilities; and calls on the Department of Health and Human Services to provide information, resources, and technical assistance regarding such services that enable individuals with disabilities to live independently.</summary>
