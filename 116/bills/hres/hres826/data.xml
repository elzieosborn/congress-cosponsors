  <summary date="2020-02-10T21:38:19Z" status="Passed House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) should withdraw recent guidance regarding the approval of block grants under Medicaid demonstration waivers.

On January 30, 2020, the CMS issued guidance allowing states to apply for capped block grants through Medicaid demonstration waivers, particularly in order to cover services for the Medicaid expansion population (i.e., adults under the age of 65). The guidance also allows states that receive such block grants to make other changes to their programs (e.g., formularies for prescription drugs).</summary>
