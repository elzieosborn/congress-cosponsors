Additionally, the resolution adopts H.Res. 661 (authorizing the Office of General Counsel of the House to retain private counsel, either for pay or pro bono, in support of the ongoing inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House to impeach President Trump) and H.Res. 693 (authorizing the Director of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Director of the Office of the Whistleblower Ombudsman to each appoint and fix the pay of their office's employees).

H.Res. 6 (adopting the Rules of the House of Representatives for the 116th Congress) is amended to (1) require the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress to submit its final report to the House by October 30, 2020, and (2) terminate the committee at the conclusion of the 116th Congress.

At any time on the legislative day of Thursday, November 21, 2019, it shall be in order to consider in the House a motion to discharge the Committee on Foreign Affairs from consideration of H.Con.Res. 70 (directing the President to remove unauthorized U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Syria).</summary>
