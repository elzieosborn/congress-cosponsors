  <summary date="2020-08-10T14:16:51Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution condemns the Assad regime, Russia, and associated forces for violating ceasefire agreements and for attacking medical personnel and institutions, targeting civilians, or committing other war crimes and gross violations of human rights. Further, it expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that (1) the United States and the international community should support the ceasefire and work to ensure humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees and vulnerable populations in Syria, and (2) Syria should seek a political solution that promotes a road map for peace in the country.</summary>
