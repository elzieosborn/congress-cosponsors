The resolution calls on President Trump to (1) refrain from any conduct that invites foreign interference in U.S. elections or undermines U.S. government investigations into foreign interference, (2) respect the constitutionally defined separation of powers, (3) uphold his oath of office and fulfill his constitutional responsibilities to the American people, and (4) acknowledge and admit wrongdoing and apologize to the American people.</summary>
