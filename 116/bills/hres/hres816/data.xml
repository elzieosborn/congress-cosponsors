  <summary date="2020-02-26T17:35:09Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution recognizes the contribution of the Greensboro Four to the civil rights movement and the significant role they played as a catalyst for the mobilization of college students coalescing in the formation of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee.

The resolution (1) recognizes that ethnic and racial diversity of the United States enriches and strengthens the nation, and (2) encourages states to include the history and contributions of the Greensboro Four in their educational curricula.</summary>
