Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc.) that promotes or displays symbols, signs, and vestiges of racism, oppression, and intimidation; by abating the use of government speech through signs, actions, and words that promote division and tear at the fabric of American society; and by taking actions to ensure that government speech does not foster division, disharmony, or intolerance through government-issued or sponsored flags, signs, images, or other symbols."
