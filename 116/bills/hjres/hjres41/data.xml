  <summary date="2019-05-31T13:56:58Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution requires either the advice and consent of the Senate or an act of Congress before the President may suspend, or withdraw the United States from, the North Atlantic Treaty. No funds shall be authorized or appropriated to support any efforts to withdraw from the treaty without the Senate's approval by a two-thirds vote or an act of Congress.

The President shall notify Congress in writing of any effort to suspend or withdraw from the treaty no later than 48 hours after such action.

This joint resolution also authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel and the General Counsel of the House of Representatives to represent Congress in judicial proceedings related to actions that are inconsistent with this resolution.</summary>
