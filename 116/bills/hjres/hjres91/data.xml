  <summary date="2020-07-10T21:47:26Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment that grants U.S. citizens who are 18 years of age or older a right to vote unless they are serving a sentence for a felony in a correctional facility at the time of an election. (Currently, some states disallow individuals from voting, either temporarily or indefinitely,&#160;after incarceration for a felony.)</summary>
