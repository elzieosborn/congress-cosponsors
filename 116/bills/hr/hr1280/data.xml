This bill provides continuing appropriations to prevent a government shutdown if any appropriations measure for a fiscal year has not been enacted before a fiscal year begins or a joint resolution making continuing appropriations is not in effect.

 The bill provides the appropriations to continue programs, projects, and activities for which funds were provided in the preceding fiscal year. The bill funds the programs at the rate of operations that was provided for the prior fiscal year with an increase for inflation.</summary>
