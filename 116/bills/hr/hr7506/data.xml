  <summary date="2020-11-23T22:11:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice for Victims of Lawless Cities Act of 2020

This bill allows a victim of a felony that occurs in an autonomous zone to sue and recover damages from the state or local government where the zone is located.

Specifically, the bill applies to areas where, by law or practice, state or local officials or entities purposefully either refuse to provide emergency services to at least one individual or give up law enforcement powers to nongovernmental actors.

Further, a state or local government must agree to waive any immunity regarding these civil actions as a condition of receiving a community development block grant or specified federal public works and economic development grants.</summary>
