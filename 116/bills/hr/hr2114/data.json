The plan must address potential hazards to each energy sector or system, including physical threats and cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nUpon request of a state, DOE may provide information and technical assistance, and other assistance, in the development, implementation, or revision of a state energy security plan.\n\nEach state that receives federal financial assistance must provide reasonable assurance to DOE that it has established policies and procedures designed to assure such assistance will increase and supplement, and not supplant, state and local funds."
