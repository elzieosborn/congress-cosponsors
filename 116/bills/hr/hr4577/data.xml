  <summary date="2021-01-14T17:08:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Expanding Disability Access to Higher Education Act

This bill establishes and revises programs to increase access to higher education for students with disabilities and increase their graduation rates.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to

 award additional funds under existing TRIO programs (i.e., programs designed to identify and support disadvantaged students) to increase the number of individuals with disabilities served by such programs; award grants to institutions of higher education to establish offices of accessibility on their campuses to support students and staff with disabilities; and collect data on students served by TRIO programs and Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, including with respect to student persistence in such programs, graduation rates, postsecondary enrollment rates, and supports provided to enrolled students. The bill also directs the Government Accountability Office to review and report on how ED and TRIO program agencies identify and support students with disabilities.</summary>
