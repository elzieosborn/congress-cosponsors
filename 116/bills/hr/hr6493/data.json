Specifically, the bill requires the VA to publish the disability benefit questionnaire form in a central location on a VA website. Such a form relates to the submission of evidence by private medical providers regarding the disability of a claimant.\n\nIf the VA modifies the disability benefit questionnaire form, the VA must accept the previous version of the form filed by a claimant if (1) the claimant files such form during the one-year period following the modification, and (2) the form is signed and dated by the medical provider and is otherwise complete and valid."
