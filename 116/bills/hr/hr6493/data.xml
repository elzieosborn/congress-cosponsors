This bill updates the placement and treatment of the disability benefit questionnaire form of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Specifically, the bill requires the VA to publish the disability benefit questionnaire form in a central location on a VA website. Such a form relates to the submission of evidence by private medical providers regarding the disability of a claimant.

If the VA modifies the disability benefit questionnaire form, the VA must accept the previous version of the form filed by a claimant if (1) the claimant files such form during the one-year period following the modification, and (2) the form is signed and dated by the medical provider and is otherwise complete and valid.</summary>
