This bill provides support for rehabilitating aging water-supply infrastructure (e.g., dams) and establishes a pilot project within the Bureau of Reclamation to review flood measures.

The bill establishes within the Department of Treasury the Aging Infrastructure Account, which shall provide funds and funding assistance to entities responsible for costs of certain major, nonrecurring maintenance of bureau-owned water infrastructure.

The bill also requires the bureau to establish a pilot program to adjust the flood control rule curves (i.e., the amount of storage space required to capture floodwater) for certain facilities.</summary>
