    "text": "This bill establishes a new criminal offense for preventing or otherwise interfering with the ability of any individual or class of individuals from obtaining or providing a lifesaving medical procedure or treatment. However, the parent or legal guardian of a minor shall not be subject to any penalties under this bill with respect to medical decisions directed exclusively at that minor.\n\nAn individual who engages in this conduct is subject to a fine, a prison term, or both. The amount of the fine and duration of the prison term depends on whether it is a first or subsequent offense and whether the obstruction is nonviolent or results in bodily injury or death.\n\nIn addition, an aggrieved individual may bring a civil action against an individual whose conduct prevented access to, or the provision of, a lifesaving medical procedure or treatment, and the Department of Justice and the Attorney General of a state or territory may also commence civil actions for violations of this bill."
