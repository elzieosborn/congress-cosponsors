This bill prohibits the use of federal funds for implementing Executive Order 13925, which, among other things, directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to file a petition requesting that the Federal Communications Commission propose regulations to clarify the exemption from civil liability that interactive computer services (e.g., social media sites) receive for their moderation of third party content.</summary>
