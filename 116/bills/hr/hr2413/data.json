(TPS is available to nationals of certain designated countries, and such aliens shall have work authorization and not be removed from the United States while the status is in effect.)\n\nA Nicaraguan national shall be eligible for such status under this bill if the individual has been continuously physically present in the United States since the bill's enactment, meets the admissibility standards generally applicable to TPS aliens, and registers for such status with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS shall grant a TPS alien prior consent to temporarily travel abroad for emergency and extenuating consequences beyond the alien's control, and the alien shall retain such status upon return."
