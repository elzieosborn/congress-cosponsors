  <summary date="2020-01-10T16:52:47Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill revises Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) program requirements to address small businesses that are controlled and owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including those owned by veterans.

Among other things, the bill

 directs the Department of Transportation to develop a training program for FAA employees who provide guidance and training to entities that certify a small business as a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; revises application requirements for certain airports to impose passenger facility charges, including by requiring such airports to include a detailed description of good faith efforts to contract with disadvantaged businesses; and requires certain airports to report annually on the number of new disadvantaged businesses that were awarded a contract or concession during the previous fiscal year.</summary>
