This bill deems certain institutions of higher education (IHEs) ineligible to receive certain emergency relief funds to address the coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19).

Specifically, an IHE with an endowment greater than $10 billion in 2019 is generally ineligible to receive such funds and must return any funds it received to the Department of Education (ED). However, such an IHE may receive and keep&#160;these funds if it provides documentation to ED that it expended 1,000% of the amount of the funds&#160;on emergency relief (e.g., financial-aid grants to students).</summary>
