  <summary date="2021-02-09T20:32:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Pandemic Responder Service Award Act

This bill establishes a monetary award for health care workers who provide eligible services during the COVID-19 (i.e. coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. The award may only be used by the worker or their dependents for specified purposes, such as repaying student loans or starting a business. Eligible services include, among others, emergency medical services, health care or patient care services, and mortuary services in environments that present an elevated risk of contracting COVID-19.

The maximum award amount is $10,000 in 2021, with amounts in subsequent years increased by cost-of-living adjustments. Recipients receive a percentage of that amount based on the number of days they provided eligible services during the pandemic.

The Department of the Treasury must establish application processes and guidelines for the award and maintain savings accounts for eligible health care workers or their dependents to receive distributions of award amounts.</summary>
