    "text": "Stop Higher Education Espionage and Theft Act of 2019\n\nThis bill establishes a process for designating foreign actors as foreign intelligence threats to higher education.\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) must designate a foreign actor as a foreign intelligence threat to higher education if the foreign actor has committed, attempted to commit, or conspired to commit certain actions in connection with an institution of higher education (IHE), such as espionage, misuse of visas, or theft of trade secrets. Prior to making such a designation, FBI must submit notice to congressional leaders and the Department of Justice.\n\nUpon the designation of a foreign actor as such a threat, the Department of State must revoke the nonimmigrant visa issued to such foreign actor present in the United States, and the Department of Homeland Security must initiate removal proceedings against the foreign actor.\n\nThe bill provides for judicial review and a process for revoking a foreign actor's designation as such a threat.\n\nIt also requires an IHE to disclose to the Department of Education any gift or contract with a foreign intelligence threat, including the fair market value of the gift or contract."
