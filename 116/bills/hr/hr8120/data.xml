This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA), through specified offices, centers, and programs, to train and educate field representatives on investments in areas designated as qualified opportunity zones.

Opportunity zone designation is an economic development tool that facilitates investment in distressed areas to spur economic growth and job creation in low-income communities.

Field representatives shall (1) serve as the point of contact for questions and resources on such investments, (2) educate local elected leaders on such investments, and (3) hold an annual seminar in each state to provide education on how to benefit from such investments.

The SBA must submit an annual report on the efforts of the field representatives.</summary>
