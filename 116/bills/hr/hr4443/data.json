In determining the cash wage any employer is required to pay a tipped employee, such wage shall be no less than the amount equal to 30% of the federal minimum wage determined for the metropolitan statistical area or the nonmetropolitan portion in which the employer resides.\n\nAny employer may pay a newly hired employee who is 18 years of age or younger, or in the case of the wage that applies in Puerto Rico 24 years of age or younger, during the first 90 consecutive days after the employee's initial employment, a wage which is not less than 2/3 of the federal minimum wage determined for the metropolitan statistical area or the nonmetropolitan portion in which the employer resides."
