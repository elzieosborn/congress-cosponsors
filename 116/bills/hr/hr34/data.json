Further, the strategic plan must (1)\u00a0consider the effects climate variability may have on water supplies and quality for energy generation and fuel production, and (2) improve the understanding of the energy required to provide reliable water supplies as well as the water required to provide reliable energy supplies. The plan must be updated every five years.\n\nIn addition, DOE must establish an Energy-Water Committee to promote and enable improved energy and water resource data collection, reporting, and technological innovation."
