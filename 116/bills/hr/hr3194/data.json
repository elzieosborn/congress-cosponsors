The President may (1) make such loans with lower interest rates than required by statute, and (2) charge fees associated with such loans. Before making such a loan, the Department of State shall certify to Congress that the receiving country (1) is making demonstrable progress toward meeting its NATO defense-spending obligations, (2) is respecting the country's constitution and upholding democratic values, and (3) has demonstrated a commitment to a free market economy and the capacity to meet the loan's terms."
