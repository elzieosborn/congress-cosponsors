The term also means any other amphibian species categorized on such list as data deficient or under a threat category lower than endangered if Interior determines that (1) the most recent IUCN Red List assessment indicates that the population is decreasing, or (2) such species is facing new or emerging threats.\n\nThe bill establishes the fund as a separate account in the Multinational Species Conservation Fund."
