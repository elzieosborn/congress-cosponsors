  <summary date="2021-09-07T14:43:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Farmer-Driven Conservation Outcomes Act of 2020 

The bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a conservation effects assessment project to

 quantify the environmental and economic effects of conservation practices, develop the science base for managing the agricultural landscape for environmental quality and sustainable productive capacity, and improve the efficacy of conservation practices and programs by evaluating conservation effects. USDA must establish a goals and assessment process for conservation programs that includes

 the identification of natural resource and environmental objectives, outcomes, and results for the programs; assessments of the resulting changes in the status and conditions of natural resources and the environment; and a monitoring and evaluation process for the programs and initiatives. In implementing the monitoring and evaluation process, USDA must use certain funds provided for conservation programs and establish a National Technical Committee. USDA may enter into cooperative agreements with government agencies, universities and colleges, and nongovernmental organizations to assist in implementing the monitoring and evaluation process.

The bill also sets forth reporting requirements regarding the progress conservation programs have made in achieving the objectives and outcomes.</summary>
