This bill prohibits the&#160;transfer of&#160;an F-35 aircraft to Turkey and various activities related to such a transfer. The prohibition may be waived if the President certifies to Congress that Turkey does not intend to accept delivery of the S-400 air defense system, which Turkey has agreed to buy from Russia.</summary>
