  <summary date="2020-03-23T21:29:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Bridging Agency Data Gaps and Ensuring Safety for Native Communities Act or the BADGES for Native Communities Act

This bill modifies policies and procedures related to information sharing, reporting and investigation of missing, unidentified, and murdered Native Americans. Among other elements, the bill requires the Department of Justice to do the following:

 share information with the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) on missing persons and unidentified remains, ensure technical assistance and training are provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and tribal law enforcement agencies to utilize the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and other national databases, establish the Tribal Access Program to enhance the ability of tribal governments to access and enter information into federal criminal information databases, establish a grant program for specified entities to implement changes to enhance response to missing person and murder cases of interest to tribes, and work with the Indian Health Service and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to ensure resources for mental health wellness programs are available to tribal and BIA law enforcement officers experiencing occupational stress. The bill expands access to (1) the national crime information database for NamUs, and (2) the NCIC for each tribal justice official.

Finally, the bill requires the Department of the Interior to establish a five-year demonstration program for the purpose of conducting or adjudicating personnel background investigations for applicants for law enforcement positions in the BIA.</summary>
