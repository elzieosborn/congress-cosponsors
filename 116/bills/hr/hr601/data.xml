This bill establishes a new, separate registration process for manufacturers of cannabis for research.

As a part of this process, the Drug Enforcement Administration must annually assess whether there is an adequate and uninterrupted supply of research cannabis and register additional manufacturers.

The bill also authorizes health care providers of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide information to veterans regarding participation in federally approved cannabis clinical trials.</summary>
