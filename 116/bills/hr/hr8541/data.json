    "text": "This bill allows certain veterans who are federal employees to retain disabled veteran leave for a longer period of time, and restores leave that was forfeited due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).\n\nCurrently, veterans may use specific medical leave for purposes of receiving treatment for service-connected disabilities during the first 12 months of federal employment; unused leave must be forfeited after this period.\n\nThe bill allows veterans whose first day of federal employment is between March 1, 2019, and June 1, 2021, to use such medical leave during the first 24 months of their employment. The bill also restores forfeited leave to these veterans if treatment was unavailable at a Veterans Affairs medical provider due to COVID-19; restored leave must be used within 12 months of initial forfeiture."
