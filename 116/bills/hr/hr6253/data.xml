This bill (1) establishes an award for the successful development of a vaccine for the coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19), and (2) extends specified Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration exemptions to issuers of securities responding to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The bill provides appropriations for the purpose of awarding&#160;a prize to the creator of a vaccine that (1) reduces the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 by more than 50%, and (2) is affordable and widely available to the public.

Additionally, an issuer of securities that&#160;is developing a coronavirus vaccine, researching or producing medical equipment related to COVID-19, or researching or producing technology related to preventing the spread of COVID-19 may qualify for an exemption from SEC registration requirements&#160;regardless of the size of the issuer's offers&#160;or sales. Furthermore, these issuers are not subject to joint and several liability for certain claims.

The provisions set forth in this bill expire the earlier of (1) the date the prize is awarded, or (2) three years after enactment.

The Government Accountability Office must report on the bill's effects.</summary>
