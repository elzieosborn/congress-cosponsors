Furthermore, these issuers are not subject to joint and several liability for certain claims.\n\nThe provisions set forth in this bill expire the earlier of (1) the date the prize is awarded, or (2) three years after enactment.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the bill's effects."
