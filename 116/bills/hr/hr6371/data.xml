  <summary date="2020-06-10T18:35:01Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires certain issuers of securities to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), during a global pandemic, information related to risks faced by the issuer. Specifically, if the World Health Organization declares a pandemic, an issuer must disclose to the SEC

 risks faced by the issuer, including risks to health and safety faced by employees and independent contractors; mitigation measures, including those taken to protect the workforce's wages, health care, and leave; and the effect the pandemic may have on the issuer's business, solvency, and workforce. The SEC must make such reports publicly available on its website.</summary>
