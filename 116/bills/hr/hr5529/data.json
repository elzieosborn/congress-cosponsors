(The WEP reduces OASDI benefits for those who receive pensions for certain non-covered employment.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill (1) lowers the required number of years of coverage required to be exempt from the WEP from 30 to 25 years, (2) changes how partial exemptions are calculated for individuals who have more than 20 but less than 25 years of coverage, and (3) reduces the dollar amount an individual must earn to qualify for a year of coverage."
