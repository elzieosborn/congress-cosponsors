    "text": "Care for All Act of 2019\n\nThis bill eliminates restrictions on who may purchase catastrophic health plans and allows such plans to be offered in both the individual and group markets.\n\n Catastrophic health plans do not cover any benefits, other than three primary care visits per year, before the deductible is met; such plans are generally characterized by lower premiums and higher deductibles. Currently, only individuals who are younger than 30 years of age or who have a hardship exemption may purchase such plans. Additionally, such plans may only be offered in the individual market."
