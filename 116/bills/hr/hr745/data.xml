This bill expands the duties and authorities of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) and reauthorizes the OGE through FY2023.

Among other things, the bill authorizes the OGE to

 issue subpoenas during investigations, and order corrective actions (e.g., divestiture) and issue administrative remedies (e.g., suspension or demotion). The OGE must provide ethics education and training to all designated and alternate designated agency ethics officials, who must register with, and report to, the OGE and their appointing authority. Agency ethics officials must provide specified ethics records to the OGE in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable format; such information must be published on the OGE's website.</summary>
