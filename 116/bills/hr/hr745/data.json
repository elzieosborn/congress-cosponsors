The OGE must provide ethics education and training to all designated and alternate designated agency ethics officials, who must register with, and report to, the OGE and their appointing authority. Agency ethics officials must provide specified ethics records to the OGE in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable format; such information must be published on the OGE's website."
