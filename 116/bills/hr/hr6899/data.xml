This bill requires certain federal agencies to notify renters of federally assisted dwelling units of the rights, relief, and assistance available to them in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.

The notice must explain, for example (1) the effect of the eviction moratorium established by the CARES Act, (2) tenants' continuing obligation to pay rent, and (3) various fair housing protections. The notice must be sent out within seven days of the bill's enactment.</summary>
