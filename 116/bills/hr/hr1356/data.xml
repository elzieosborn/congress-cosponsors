This bill establishes reporting requirements with respect to a special counsel appointed by the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Specifically, it requires a special counsel to submit a report, within 30 days, to DOJ and Congress (1) at the conclusion of an investigation; or (2) when the special counsel is removed from office, transferred within DOJ, or resigns before the completion of the investigation. The report must include the factual findings of the investigation and significant expenditures, explain prosecutorial decisions, and be made publicly available.

Additionally, a special counsel must submit periodic reports to DOJ and Congress on budgetary requirements and expenditures, personnel, and performance statistics.

Finally, the bill requires DOJ to notify Congress when a special counsel is removed or transferred.</summary>
