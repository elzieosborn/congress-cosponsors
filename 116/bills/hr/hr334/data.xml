This bill provides incentives for cybersecurity education.

It establishes an employee&#160;cybersecurity education tax credit&#160;for an employer&#160;who incurs costs for an employee who earns a certain cybersecurity certificate or degree. If a business claims such a credit, then executive agencies must award a score increase to each competitive proposal submitted by the business for a federal contract valued at more than $5 million.

In addition, the Department of Education may cancel eligible student loans&#160;for borrowers who have (1) made 36 consecutive monthly payments, and (2) held a cybersecurity job in an economically distressed area during at least 12 months of payments.

Finally, the bill makes cybersecurity course instructors eligible for awards under the CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service program.</summary>
