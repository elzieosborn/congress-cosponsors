This bill revises certain disclosure requirements for institutions of higher education (IHEs).

Specifically, the bill requires an IHE to disclose to the Department of Education any gift from or contract with a foreign entity or individual valued at $50,000 or more. Currently, an IHE must make such a disclosure if the gift or contract is valued at $250,000 or more.

An IHE must report, if available, the purpose of the gift or contract.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to study and report on IHEs' compliance with these disclosure requirements.</summary>
