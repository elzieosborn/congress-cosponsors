Currently, individuals may file such a complaint through a state-based administrative procedure.\n\nFurther, DOJ must immediately provide (1) a copy of the complaint to the entity responsible for administering the state-based administrative complaint procedure for the state involved in such complaint, and (2) a copy of the response to such entity.\n\nThe bill also permits such an individual, including an individual who seeks to enforce their right to a voter-verified ballot, to file a civil action for deprivation of rights."
