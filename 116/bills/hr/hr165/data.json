Similarly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\u00a0must revise its regulations to require jurisdictions that receive funding from HUD to include information relating to veterans in their consolidated plans.\n\nHUD must also conduct an assessment of\u00a0the housing needs of very low-income veteran families and report annually on its activities relating to veterans."
