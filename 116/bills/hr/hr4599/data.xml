This bill authorizes assistance to jurisdictions and organizations providing services for aliens released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

The assistance authorized under this bill shall (1) be for FY2021, FY2022, and FY2023; (2) only be used to provide assistance for aliens released from DHS custody; (3) be distributed by the Emergency Food and Shelter Program National Board; and (4) only be given to jurisdictions that have experienced a significant influx of released aliens or organizations in such jurisdictions.

The protocols related to releasing aliens and issuing notices to appear shall include requirements related to (1) coordinating with local governments and organizations on a release date and time, (2) releasing aliens in locations where organizations can provide assistance, and (3) ensuring that notices to appear contain complete and accurate information.</summary>
