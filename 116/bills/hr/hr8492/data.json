    "text": "Count Every Vote Act of 2020\n\nThis bill revises the electoral college's time frame for presidential elections, particularly with regard to the meeting of electors and the counting of electoral votes.\n\nFirst, the bill requires states to make final determinations of controversies or contests as to the appointment of electors within three (instead of six) days before the electors meet in their respective states to cast their votes for President and Vice President.\n\nFurther, it extends the date for state electors to meet and vote from the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December following their appointment to the first day after January 1 following their appointment.\n\nIn addition, it requires states to deliver certificates of electoral votes in the most expeditious method available, including by overnight delivery or a secure form of electronic transmission. Currently, states may transmit these certificates only by registered mail.\n\nFinally, the bill changes the date for the joint session of Congress to count electoral votes from the sixth day of January succeeding the meeting of the state electors to the second day following the extended deadline for the receipt of certificates and votes by the President of the Senate or the Archivist of the United States."
