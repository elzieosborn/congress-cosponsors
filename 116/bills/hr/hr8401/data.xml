  <summary date="2020-11-16T19:34:56Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture to complete an interagency report on the use of special recreation permits by recreation service providers serving environmental justice communities.

The bill defines an environmental justice community as a community with significant representation of communities of color, low-income communities, or tribal and indigenous communities, that experiences, or is at risk of experiencing, higher or more adverse human health or environmental effects than other communities.

Interior and USDA (1) shall contact all current or prospective special recreation providers to request a voluntary estimation of how many user days are used by individuals from environmental justice communities; (2) shall request from recreational service providers and interested members of the public any other information that supports the reporting requirements in this bill; and (3) shall not use participation or information provided as a condition in approving or rejecting a special recreation permit.</summary>
