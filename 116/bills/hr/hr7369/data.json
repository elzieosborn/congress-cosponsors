    "text": "Cable Transparency Act\n\nThis bill modifies the term and termination of cable franchises.\n\nSpecifically, the bill provides that a cable franchise shall continue without any requirement for an operator to renew such franchise until the date the franchise is revoked or terminated. Under current law, a cable operator must submit a proposal for renewal of the franchise to the franchising authority.\n\nThe bill prohibits generally (1) a franchising authority from revoking a franchise, (2) a cable operator from terminating a franchise, or (3) the revocation or termination of a franchise by operation of law. However, a cable operator may terminate a franchise by submitting a written request to the franchising authority for the revocation of such franchise, and a franchise authority may revoke a franchise if it finds that the cable operator has knowingly and willfully failed to meet a material requirement of the franchise.\n\nFurther, during a franchise period, a cable operator may obtain the elimination or modification of a franchise requirement by submitting a request for such elimination or modification to the franchise authority."
