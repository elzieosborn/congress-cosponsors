  <summary date="2021-06-02T12:53:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Workforce Promotion and Access Act or the WPA Act

This bill requires the Department of Labor to establish a program to provide competitive grants to eligible entities (i.e., political subdivisions of states and Tribal entities with a high unemployment rate and outlying areas) to establish programs to ensure employment to individuals residing in the areas served by such entities.

The bill also imposes a trading excise tax on certain transactions occurring on a qualified board or exchange in the United States or with respect to a derivative.</summary>
