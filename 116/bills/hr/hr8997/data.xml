This bill prohibits federal civil asset forfeiture and imposes restrictions on state civil asset forfeiture.

Specifically, property belonging to a person may be forfeited to a state government pursuant to a civil proceeding only after (1) a criminal conviction of the property owner under state criminal law; or (2) the state, in a civil proceeding where the property owner has the same constitutional rights provided to criminal defendants, proves that the property owner has committed the offense giving rise to the forfeiture.</summary>
