Competency-based education refers to education that measures academic progress and attainment (1) by direct assessment of the student's mastery of competencies, (2) by expressing the student's mastery of competencies in terms of equivalent credit or clock hours, or (3) through a combination of both methods in addition to credit or clock hours.\n\nThe bill also prohibits the Department of Education from enforcing regulations related to credit hours."
