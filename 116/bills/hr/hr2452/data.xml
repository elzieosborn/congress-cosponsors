  <summary date="2020-08-26T15:29:15Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare for America Act of 2019

This bill establishes several health insurance programs and otherwise modifies certain requirements relating to health care coverage, costs, and services.

In particular, the bill establishes a national health insurance program to be&#160;administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among other requirements, the program must (1) cover all U.S. residents; (2) cover specified items and services, including hospital services, prescription drugs, dental services, and home- and community-based long-term care; and (3) be fully implemented in 2023. HHS must also offer a transitional public health option that provides certain minimum coverage through health insurance exchanges in 2021 and 2022.

The bill also makes a series of other changes to health care and tax provisions. For example, the bill (1) allows federal funds to be used for abortions; (2) sunsets a specified tax reform law that, among other things, repealed the penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential health coverage; and (3) prohibits excessive prices for prescription drugs and medical devices, as determined by a newly established federal regulatory board.</summary>
