This bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development to award grants to nonprofit organizations, public housing agencies, and other entities for&#160;the preservation of manufactured housing communities.

Such funds may be used to (1) acquire and preserve manufactured housing communities; (2) make improvements to common areas and community property in such communities; and (3) demolish, remove, and replace dilapidated homes in such communities. A grantee that uses funds to acquire a manufactured housing community must agree to maintain the community for at least 20 years.</summary>
