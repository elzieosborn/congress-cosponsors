 This bill requires individuals to use contributions or donations not later than six years following the most recent federal election in which the individual was a candidate and before the individual becomes a registered lobbyist.

 The bill requires remaining contributions or donations to be disposed of within 30 days, first by paying debts or obligations owed in connection with the campaign for that office. Additional remaining funds must be disposed of by (1) returning those contributions or donations to the individuals, entities, or both, who made them; (2) making contributions to a charitable organization; or (3) making transfers to a national, state, or local committee of a political party.</summary>
