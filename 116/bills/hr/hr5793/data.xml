This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to install surveillance technology and take other actions with respect to the U.S.-Mexico border.

DHS shall deploy the most practical and effective technology available to achieve situational awareness and operational control of the border. Such technology may include radar surveillance systems, tunnel detection technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

DHS is authorized to waive legal requirements as necessary in order to implement the necessary surveillance technology along the border.

DHS shall also (1) construct a navigable road along at least 700 miles of the southwest border, (2) permanently eradicate certain foliage that grows along the Rio Grande river, and (3) report to Congress a comprehensive strategy about the barriers and technologies needed to secure operational control along the border.

Drug cartel funds that have been criminally forfeited to the U.S. government shall be reserved for security measures along the U.S.-Mexico border.</summary>
