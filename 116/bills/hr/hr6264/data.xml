This bill creates a new criminal offense for price gouging during a state of emergency.

Specifically, in a location that has received a state of emergency declaration, the bill prohibits the sale of certain goods or services&#8212;those vital and necessary for consumer health, safety, and welfare&#8212;at an unconscionably excessive price (e.g., a price higher than the average price during the 30-day period before the emergency declaration was made).

A violator is subject to fine, a prison term of up to five years, or both.</summary>
