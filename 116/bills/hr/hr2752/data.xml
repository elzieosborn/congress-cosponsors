  <summary date="2021-02-24T19:52:42Z" status="Introduced in House">VA Newborn Emergency Treatment Act

This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish transportation in connection with the receipt of covered health care services for a newborn child of a woman veteran (and the child's parents). The bill expands covered health care services to include services furnished at health care facilities other than the facility where the child was delivered.

Under the bill, the VA may furnish more than seven days of health care services and transportation to such services if a child is in need of additional care.

Expenses incurred for transportation furnished in order for a newborn child of a veteran to receive health care services prior to the enactment of this bill may be waived or reimbursed to the veteran by the VA.</summary>
