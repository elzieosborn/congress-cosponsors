The division also expands eligibility for such disaster loans and advances to include agricultural enterprises.\n\nAdditionally, the division requires the SBA to guarantee no less than a specified amount of paycheck protection loans made by certain insured depository institutions, community financial institutions, and credit unions.\n\n(Sec. 102) The amounts provided under this division are designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) and the Senate PAYGO rule.\n\nDIVISION B--ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS FOR CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE\n\nAdditional Emergency Appropriations for Coronavirus Response\n\nThis division provides FY2020 supplemental appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the SBA in response to COVID-19.\n\nThe supplemental appropriations are designated as emergency spending, which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.\n\nTITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\nThis title provides $100 billion in FY2020 supplemental appropriations to HHS for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, including\n\n $75 billion to reimburse health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to the coronavirus outbreak; and $25 billion for expenses to research, develop, validate, manufacture, purchase, administer, and expand capacity for COVID-19 tests to effectively monitor and suppress COVID-19. The title allocates specified portions of the $25 billion for COVID-19 testing to\n\n states, localities, territories, and tribes; the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention; the National Institutes of Health; the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority; the Food and Drug Administration; community health centers; rural health clinics; and testing for the uninsured.
