The bond shall be released to the posting alien upon (1) receiving notification that the alien has left the United States and returned to the country of origin, or (2) the alien changing or adjusting to an immigration status for which no bond is required.\n\nThe bill establishes the E-bond Enforcement Fund which shall be funded by forfeited bonds and used to ensure compliance with this bill and to administer enforcement programs.\n\nDHS shall report to Congress annually regarding: (1) visa overstay rates by nonimmigrant category, (2) categories with overstay rates greater than 1.5%, (3) bond amounts, and (4) fund information."
