Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Small Business Administration shall waive a debt owed to the United States related to such assistance provided to an individual or household if (1) such debt owed is a result of an unauthorized use of funds for such assistance, and (2) the use of funds related to the same recovery for which the assistance was provided. Such debt may not be waived if it involves fraud by the debtor."
