(Current law generally prohibits federal payment under Medicaid for services provided in IMDs for individuals under the age of 65, although states may receive payment through certain mechanisms like Medicaid demonstration waivers.)\n\nThe CMS must also establish a pilot program to test the impact of eliminating the Medicare 190-day lifetime limit\u00a0for inpatient psychiatric hospital services, particularly the impact on value, choice, and the alignment of inpatient mental health benefits with inpatient physical health care benefits under Medicare."
