  <summary date="2021-08-11T16:42:40Z" status="Introduced in House">National Police Misuse of Force Investigation Board Act of 2020

This bill establishes the National Police Misuse of Force Investigation Board to, among other duties, investigate and report on deaths that occur in police custody, officer-involved shootings, and uses of force that result in severe bodily injury in police custody.

In addition, the bill requires states and local governments that receive certain Department of Justice (DOJ) grants to (1) allow findings and recommendations of the board to be admissible in court, and (2) report on actions taken to address the recommendations of the board. DOJ may reduce allocations to states and local governments that fail to comply with these requirements.</summary>
