This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to jointly administer a school air filters demonstration program in public elementary and secondary schools.

Specifically, ED and the EPA must select at least 175 schools to participate in the program, with priority given to schools located in areas with higher levels of air pollution.

ED and the EPA must use program funds to (1) purchase and install commercial air filters in every classroom, office, and common area that students access in participating schools; (2) maintain such air filters for three years; and (3) provide technical support to participating schools.</summary>
