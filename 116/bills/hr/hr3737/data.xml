  <summary date="2021-01-29T20:59:15Z" status="Introduced in House">Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act of 2019

This bill requires a foreign manufacturer of products imported into the United States to establish a registered agent in the United States to accept service of process for regulatory proceedings or civil actions.

Specifically, the bill requires specified agencies to implement regulations requiring a foreign manufacturer or producer to establish a registered agent who is authorized to accept process on behalf of the manufacturer or producer. The agent must be located in a state with substantial connection to the import, distribution, or sale of the product and, by registering an agent, the manufacturer or producer consents to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of that state.

 Additionally, the Department of Commerce must establish, maintain, and make publicly available a registry of such agents. The Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration must also jointly report on whether to require a foreign producer of imported food to register such an agent.</summary>
