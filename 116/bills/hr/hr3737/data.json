The agent must be located in a state with substantial connection to the import, distribution, or sale of the product and, by registering an agent, the manufacturer or producer consents to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of that state.\n\n Additionally, the Department of Commerce must establish, maintain, and make publicly available a registry of such agents. The Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration must also jointly report on whether to require a foreign producer of imported food to register such an agent."
