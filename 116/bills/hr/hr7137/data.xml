This bill requires states and local governments, as a condition of receiving funding under certain Department of Justice programs, to adopt use-of-force training policies that meet minimum standards, institute boards to review incidents of the use of deadly force and allegations of excessive force by law enforcement officers, revoke certifications of law enforcement officers who violate use-of-force standards, and require de-escalation and use-of-force training. In addition, the bill requires the development of a plan for a National Law Enforcement Academy to provide best practices training for local law enforcement officers.</summary>
