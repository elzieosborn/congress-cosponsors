This bill prohibits the sale or purchase of a firearm or ammunition unless it is through a federally licensed firearms dealer (licensed dealer). It also imposes additional requirements on licensed dealers.

First, the bill makes it unlawful to knowingly sell or purchase a firearm or ammunition except through a licensed dealer. Violators are subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to 25 years, or both.

Next, it increases the cost to renew a license to deal in firearms other than destructive devices.

In addition, it requires each licensed dealer to (1) report to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and local law enforcement authorities any instance in which the licensed dealer suspects a purchaser is exhibiting signs of mental duress, or the individual is attempting to purchase a firearm on behalf of another individual; (2) display the license to deal and other information at the business premises; and (3) complete an annual training course in reducing the risk of gun violence.

Finally, DOJ must establish a toll-free telephone number for individuals to report illegal or suspicious behavior related to conduct at the business premises of a licensed dealer.</summary>
