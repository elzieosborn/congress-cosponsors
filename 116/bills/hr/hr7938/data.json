    "text": "United States Information Abroad for Strategic Competition Act or the USIA for Strategic Competition Act\n\nThis bill establishes measures to advance U.S. messaging and interests globally, including by requiring the Department of State to reconstitute for five years the Active Measures Working Group to create an information statecraft strategy for the U.S. government.\n\nThe purpose of the strategy shall be to reduce the ability of the Communist Party of China (CCP) to influence global discourse, and such strategy shall include an identification of (1) specific CCP narratives that contribute to its ability to influence global discourse, (2) counter-narratives that are most effective and most likely to reduce the ability of the CCP to influence global discourse, and (3) specific quantitative objectives for advancing such counter-narratives.\n\nThe State Department must also conduct regular research and evaluation of its public diplomacy programs and activities and ensure that such research and evaluation support strategic planning and resource allocation across all diplomacy bureaus and offices of the State Department.\n\nFurther, the bill makes permanent the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, revises the rating criteria used by the commission when evaluating certain public diplomacy and international broadcasting activities, and requires the commission to establish a Subcommittee on Research and Evaluation."
