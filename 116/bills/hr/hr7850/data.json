It also directs the President to report to Congress a strategy to prevent Iran from expanding its power in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.\n\nSpecifically, the ODNI shall report to Congress a National Intelligence Estimate (a type of intelligence community assessment) about Iran's support for proxy forces and the increased risks that this support poses to Israel and U.S. regional interests. The estimate shall address certain specific issues, including a description of Iran-affiliated forces operating in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon and an analysis of the missile and rocket production capabilities of such forces."
