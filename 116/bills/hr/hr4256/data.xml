This bill revises provisions commonly known as the Hobbs Act that prohibit obstructing (or attempting or conspiring to obstruct) interstate commerce by means of robbery or extortion.

Specifically, the bill exempts from the prohibition conduct that (1) is incidental to otherwise peaceful picketing during a labor dispute; (2) consists solely of minor bodily injury, minor property damage, or threats of such minor injury or damage; and (3) is not part of a pattern of violent conduct or of a coordinated violent activity. Such exempted conduct is subject to prosecution only by state and local authorities.</summary>
