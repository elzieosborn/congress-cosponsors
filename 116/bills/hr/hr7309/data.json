An inverted domestic corporation is a U.S. corporation that acquires foreign entities to reincorporate in a foreign jurisdiction with income tax rates lower than U.S. rates). Specifically, an inverted domestic corporation may not claim net operating loss carrybacks, increased deductibility of business interest, nor participate in Federal Reserve Lending Facilities.\n\nThe bill allows an inverted domestic corporation to elect to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. tax purposes."
