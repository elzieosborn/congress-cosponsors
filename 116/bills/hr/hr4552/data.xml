This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a process for issuing provisional transportation security cards to covered veterans for use on a vessel or in a facility to give access to areas designated as secure by DHS. Such provisional transportation security cards are for use beginning on the date a covered veteran applies for a transportation security card and ending on the date on which such card is issued or denied.

A covered veteran is an individual who (1) served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released under honorable conditions; and (2) during such service was subjected to a rigorous security screening.</summary>
