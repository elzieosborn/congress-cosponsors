  <summary date="2020-07-10T18:13:54Z" status="Introduced in House">Direct Support for Communities Act

This bill provides FY2020 supplemental appropriations to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to award additional Community Development Block Grants to units of local government and counties to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19).

Specifically, within 30 days, HUD must distribute 50% of such funds to metropolitan cities and other units of local government and 50% to counties and parishes. Such funds may be used to cover costs or replace lost, delayed, or decreased revenues stemming from the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. In addition, the funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.</summary>
