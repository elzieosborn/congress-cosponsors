  <summary date="2021-08-31T16:59:48Z" status="Introduced in House">Pandemic Supplies Production Act

This bill directs the President to immediately use existing authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure the supply of ventilators, N-95 respirator masks, and other personal protective equipment to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.

It also directs the Defense Logistics Agency within the Department of Defense to take certain actions to manage the distribution of materials to respond the COVID-19 emergency, as well as future emergencies or disasters. This agency is responsible for supply or service activities common to all military departments.</summary>
