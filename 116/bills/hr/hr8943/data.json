That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.\n\nIt also directs the Defense Logistics Agency within the Department of Defense to take certain actions to manage the distribution of materials to respond the COVID-19 emergency, as well as future emergencies or disasters. This agency is responsible for supply or service activities common to all military departments."
