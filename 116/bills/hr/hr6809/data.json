    "text": "Nurse Workforce Protection Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires health care providers that receive funds made available for provider relief under certain laws enacted to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) to maintain nurse staffing levels and prohibits them from taking other actions with respect to nurse compensation and employment for a set period of time after receiving such funds.\n\nSpecifically, these providers must retain at least 75% of the nurses employed as of January 31, 2020, for a designated period of time. Additionally, during that period, providers may not reduce nurse pay or hours by more than 25% or require nurses to take paid or unpaid leave. The period of time begins on the date funds are disbursed and lasts two months. However, for providers that made changes with respect to staffing, compensation or leave, the relevant period begins 30 days after the date of disbursement and lasts two months.\n\nProviders that do not meet these requirements must repay the COVID-19 funds that they received."
