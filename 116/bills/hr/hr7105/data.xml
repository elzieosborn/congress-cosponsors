The section also authorizes the VA to continue to pay subsistence allowances for a specified amount of time during periods following the permanent closure of an institution or the disapproval of a course of study.

(Sec. 1008) This section updates terminology related to the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program by removing a reference to established charges consistent with other laws related to the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

(Sec. 1014) The VA must notify an SAA when certain actions or events take place, such as final punitive action being taken against an educational institution. Additionally, the SAA must provide notice to the VA and other SAAs if it disapproves or suspends an educational institution.

(Sec. 1016) This section requires certain non-accredited law programs to be accredited by a specialized accrediting agency for programs of legal education in order to be approved for the administration of educational benefits.

(Sec. 1017) This section authorizes the disapproval of a course for VA education benefits if an institution does not comply with a risk-based survey by the SAA.

(Sec. 1018) This section limits participation in VA educational assistance programs if an educational institution (1) does not perform specified actions, such as providing estimated cost information to individuals prior to enrollment; (2) implements deceptive recruiting techniques or pays inducements to secure enrollments; or (3) is the subject of a negative action by its accrediting agency.

(Sec. 1019) This section provides that overpayments made by an educational institution to a veteran or eligible person shall constitute a liability of the educational institution to the United States if the payment is made as a payment of established charges to educational institutions, advance payment of initial educational assistance or subsistence allowance, a public-private contribution for additional education assistance, or a payment under the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.

(Sec. 1020) This section limits the type of advertising, sales, and marketing that schools may conduct while remaining eligible for VA education benefits by prohibiting substantial misrepresentation. Additionally, the section modifies the criteria that non-accredited courses must meet to be eligible for educational assistance.

(Sec. 1104) This section requires the VA to treat an individual's withdrawal from a program of education due to COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and December 21, 2021, as a mitigating circumstance and not charge the individual's educational assistance entitlement.

(Sec. 2003) This section codifies the rate for the Medal of Honor special pension and requires the VA to pay such pension to the surviving spouse of a Medal of Honor recipient.

(Sec. 2004) This section requires the VA to implement a service-disabled veterans life insurance program and to phase out an existing program upon implementation.

(Sec. 2005) The VA must provide specified information to a member of the uniformed services regarding a denial for traumatic injury benefits under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program (e.g., the reason for the denial and the information upon which the denial was based).

(Sec. 2006) This section requires the VA to publish on its website the disability benefit questionnaire forms for non-VA medical providers submitting evidence regarding a disability of a claimant for purposes of VA benefits.
