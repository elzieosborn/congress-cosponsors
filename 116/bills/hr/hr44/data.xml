 This bill prohibits any state whose congressional districts have been redistricted after a decennial census from carrying out another redistricting until after the next apportionment of Representatives following a decennial census, unless a court requires such state to conduct a subsequent redistricting to comply with the Constitution or enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The bill is applicable to any congressional redistricting which occurs after the regular decennial census conducted during 2020.</summary>
