  <summary date="2020-10-20T16:07:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Clean Industrial Technology Act of 2019 or the CIT Act of 2019

This bill provides incentives for the nonpower industrial sector to reduce nonwater greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish an industrial emissions reduction technology research, development, demonstration, and commercial application program. Under the program, DOE must award grants and fund demonstration projects to develop and evaluate technologies designed to increase (1) the industrial competitiveness of the United States, and (2) the emission reductions of nonpower industrial sectors. DOE may also enter into contracts and cooperative agreements for these purposes.

In addition, DOE must establish an Industrial Technology Innovation Advisory Committee to provide advice to DOE and the Office of Science and Technology Policy about the program.

Finally, DOE must establish a technical assistance program to achieve emission reductions in nonpower industrial sectors.</summary>
