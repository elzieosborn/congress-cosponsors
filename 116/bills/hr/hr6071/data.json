It also exempts the time it takes to complete environmental reviews from the 36-month deadline to complete FEMA-funded hazard mitigation projects.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the challenges to states and U.S. territories in obtaining assistance under FEMA's public assistance program alternative procedures."
