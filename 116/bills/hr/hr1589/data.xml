 This bill expands the functions of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security related to homeland-security focused intelligence and information sharing.

 The office shall

 coordinate the analysis of the intentions, capabilities, and plans of individuals or organizations threatening or preparing to conduct attacks against the homeland (including key resources and critical infrastructure) involving the use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) materials; coordinate the analysis of threats to homeland security from global infectious disease and other food, agricultural, or veterinary threats to public health; ensure the integration of such analysis with assessments of the vulnerability of and risks to the people, territory, key resources, and critical infrastructure of the United States from CBRN materials; leverage existing and emerging homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to plan for, detect, and protect against the importation, possession, storage, transportation, development, or use of unauthorized CBRN materials, and protect against an attack using such materials; and share information and provide tailored analytical support on these threats to state, local, tribal authorities, and other federal agencies.</summary>
