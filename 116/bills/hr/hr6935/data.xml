  <summary date="2021-04-16T19:36:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Protecting the Health of America's Older Adults During COVID-19 and Beyond Act

This bill establishes a resource center and other programs to address the health needs of older adults. Specifically, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must establish the National COVID-19 Resource Center for Older Adults and the Healthy Aging Program, respectively.

The center must collaborate with state and local governments, Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and nonprofits to disseminate, and support the implementation of, best practices related to the care and well-being of older adults in a variety of settings during and after the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

As part of the Healthy Aging Program, the CDC must, among other activities, coordinate public health interventions and multi-sector efforts, disseminate evidence-based practices and programs, and award grants or cooperative agreements to promote the health and well-being of older adults. Eligible grant recipients include health departments in states, specified territories and tribes, and large cities. Permitted uses of funds include improving data on older adult populations and linking health care and community services. In addition, the CDC must evaluate the activities of this program, including its impact on health disparities.</summary>
