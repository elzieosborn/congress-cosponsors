This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student-aid programs to provide students with certain information related to nutrition assistance.

Specifically, such IHEs must annually provide students with

 information on the most recent student eligibility guidance for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); contact information for the state agencies that administer SNAP and WIC; and information on food pantries, food assistance facilities, and other services that are available to enrolled students. The bill also requires the Department of Education to annually update its College Navigator website with the most recent student eligibility guidance for SNAP and WIC.</summary>
