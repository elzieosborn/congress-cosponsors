This bill requires the Department of Education to award grants to institutions of higher education that will fund fellowships for graduate students pursuing doctoral degrees in teacher education.

To be eligible for such fellowships, graduate students must be preparing for the professorate in order to educate other individuals who will become elementary and secondary school science, technology, engineering, and math teachers, special education teachers, and English language teachers.</summary>
