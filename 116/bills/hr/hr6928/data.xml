This bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to study and report on the commercial impact of three-dimensional printing.

Such study must involve, among other things (1) listing industry sectors that develop and use three-dimensional printing and public-private partnerships focused on promoting the adoption and use of such technology, (2) establishing a list of federal agencies asserting jurisdiction over such industry sectors and entities, and (3) assessing risks and trends in the marketplace and supply chain of three-dimensional printing.</summary>
