  <summary date="2020-08-07T20:41:26Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides for the removal of certain statues and a bust from display in the Capitol.

The bill directs the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) to remove the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court chamber of the Capitol and replace it with a bust of Thurgood Marshall to be obtained by the Joint Committee on the Library.

The AOC must remove the statues of Charles Brantley Aycock, John Caldwell Calhoun, and James Paul Clarke from areas of the Capitol accessible to the public. Furthermore, the AOC must store each statue until it and the state that provided the statue arrange for its return to the state.

Additionally, the bill

 prohibits the display of statues in National Statuary Hall of persons who served as officers or voluntarily with the Confederate States of America or of the military forces or government of a state while it was in rebellion against the United States; requires the AOC to identify such statues and arrange for their transfer and deliverance from the Capitol to the Smithsonian Institution, subject to the approval of the joint committee; requires the Smithsonian to follow its preexisting policies and procedures regarding the storage and display of such transferred statues; requires each statue to be returned to the providing state, including its ownership, if the state requests and agrees to pay any transportation-related costs; and permits a state that has a statue removed to replace the statue.</summary>
