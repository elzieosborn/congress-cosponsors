This bill requires the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to establish national standards and conduct studies relating to federal elections.

Specifically, the EAC must establish national standards for the location and operation of polling places used in elections for federal office. Among other things, such standards must include a requirement that no individual shall be required to wait longer than one hour to cast a vote at a polling place.

The bill requires each state to comply with the national standards established by the EAC.

Additionally, the EAC must study (1) instances of the misidentification by election officials of the political party registration of individuals attempting to vote in primary elections for federal office, and (2) instances of states purging their official voter registration lists to automatically remove individuals who do not vote.</summary>
