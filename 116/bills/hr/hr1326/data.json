The bill reauthorizes through FY2024 the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Chesapeake Bay Initiative.\n\nThe bill establishes the National Fish Habitat Board and the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council Advisory Committee on wildlife and habitat conservation, hunting, and recreational shooting.\n\nThe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Wildlife Services shall\n\n allocate funds to support states and tribes in their efforts to implement management strategies to address chronic wasting disease, and make grants to support the expansion and acceleration of applied research on such disease. The bill requires a National Academy of Sciences study on the transmission of chronic wasting disease in any species within the family Cervidae (the deer family) in the United States."
