  <summary date="2021-08-20T18:04:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement Act of 2019 or READI Act

This bill modifies how citizens receive emergency alerts through wireless and broadcast emergency alert systems.

Specifically, the bill includes emergency alerts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a type of alert that mobile subscribers may not block from their devices (currently, only alerts from the President may not be blocked). FEMA must develop and issue guidance for how state, tribal, and local governments can participate in the integrated public alert and warning system.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must adopt regulations that encourage states to establish a State Emergency Communications Commission (SECC) and require each SECC to meet at least annually to review and update its Emergency Alert System Plan. The FCC must approve or disapprove the updated plan.

 The FCC shall also (1) establish a system to receive from FEMA or state, tribal, or local governments reports of false alerts under the Emergency Alert System (EAS) or the Wireless EAS to record such false alerts and examine their causes; (2) modify the EAS to provide for repeating messages while an alert remains pending; and (3) examine the feasibility of updating the EAS to enable or improve alerts provided through the internet, including through audio and video streaming services.</summary>
