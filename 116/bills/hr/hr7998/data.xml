This bill instructs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to consider institutions of higher education when facilitating and supporting the development of a voluntary, consensus-based, industry-led set of standards, guidelines, best practices, methodologies, procedures, and processes to cost-effectively reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure.

In using such authority, NIST shall disseminate and make publicly available resources to help research institutions and institutions of higher education identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk related to conducting research with respect to COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).</summary>
