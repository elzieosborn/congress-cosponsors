  <summary date="2021-06-07T17:10:55Z" status="Introduced in House">Suspicious Order Identification Act of 2019

This bill requires the Drug Enforcement Administration to implement a program that requires real-time reporting of every sale, delivery, or disposal of any controlled substance (i.e., substances regulated under federal law because of their potential for dependence and addiction).The bill also establishes a Suspicious Order Monitoring Task Force to make recommendations regarding the program. Until the program is operational, the bill also increases the frequency of current reporting requirements.</summary>
