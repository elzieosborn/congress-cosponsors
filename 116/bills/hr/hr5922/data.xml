  <summary date="2020-08-03T18:25:37Z" status="Introduced in House">Ronald V. Dellums Memorial Fellowship for Women of Color in STEAM and National Security Act

This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a fellowship program that provides scholarships and internships to underrepresented students who have high potential talent in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts,&#160;and mathematics) in exchange for those students working in the federal government or in a STEAM field upon graduation.

DOD must award at least 50% of the number of fellowships under the program to students who attend historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions.</summary>
