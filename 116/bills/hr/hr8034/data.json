    "text": "Veterans Infertility Treatment Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish infertility treatments, standard fertility preservation services, or both to a covered veteran, spouse, partner, or gestational surrogate if the individuals jointly apply for such treatments or services. A covered veteran is a veteran who has infertility and is enrolled in the VA health care system.\n\nUnder the bill, in vitro fertilization treatment may only be furnished for up to three completed cycles resulting in live birth or six attempted cycles, whichever occurs first.\n\nThe bill authorizes the VA to pay the adoption expenses (for up to three adoptions) for covered veterans.\n\n During the interim period before infertility treatment and adoption assistance regulations are in effect, the VA must ensure that fertility counseling and treatment for veterans may also be furnished to the partner of a veteran regardless of whether the veteran and the partner are married. Additionally, the VA may furnish such counseling and treatment using donated gametes or embryos.\n\nThe VA must facilitate research conducted collaboratively by the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services to improve the ability of the VA to meet the long-term reproductive health care needs of veterans who have infertility conditions.\n\nFinally, the VA must ensure that useful information produced by such research is disseminated throughout the Veterans Health Administration."
