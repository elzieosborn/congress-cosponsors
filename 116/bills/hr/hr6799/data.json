Qualified fixed expenses include a mortgage, rent, or a utility payment.\n\nAn employer is eligible for such payroll credit if the employer was carrying on a trade or business in 2020 which had not more than 1,500 full-time employees or not more than $41.5 million in gross receipts in 2019. The employer's business must have been suspended in a calendar quarter due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and have experienced a significant decline in gross receipts due to that pandemic..\n\nThe credit may not be claimed by the federal government or by any state or tribal government, or by U.S. possessions, but may be claimed by tax-exempt organizations."
