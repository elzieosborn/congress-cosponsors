    "text": "Native American Education Opportunity Act\n\nThis bill addresses education savings account programs and charter schools for tribal students.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Department of Education, at the request of federally recognized Indian tribes, to\u00a0provide funds to such tribes for tribal-based education savings account programs. Tribes must use such funds to award grants to education savings accounts for students who (1)\u00a0attended or will be eligible to attend a school operated by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE); or (2) will not be attending a school operated by the BIE, receiving an education savings account from another tribe, or attending public elementary or secondary school while participating in the program.\n\nFunds may be used for items and activities such as costs of attendance at private schools, private tutoring and online learning programs, textbooks, educational software, or examination fees.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must review the implementation of these education savings account programs, including any factors impacting increased participation in such programs.\n\nAdditionally, the bill authorizes the BIE to approve and fund charter schools at any school that it operates or funds."
