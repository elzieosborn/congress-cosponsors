This bill authorizes Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance during a public health emergency to include efforts to provide individuals with access to potable water and basic sanitation.

Specifically, FEMA may, during an emergency period, provide every individual access to potable water and basic sanitation through the use of federal agencies. It may also make grants to carry out such efforts, including

 installation of mobile water stations and hand washing facilities, distribution or delivery of emergency bottled water and personal and home sanitization products, reconnection of water utility service, and moratorium on water utility shutoffs. FEMA may reimburse state, local, or tribal governments that provided such services.</summary>
