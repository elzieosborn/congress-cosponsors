    "text": "This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a grant program for states to improve public safety and environmental performance of the natural gas distribution system by offsetting rate increases to low-income households and providing incentives for natural gas distribution companies to accelerate, expand, or enhance improvements to the natural gas distribution system.\n\nGrants must be used for (1) replacement of cast and wrought iron and bare steel pipes and other leak-prone components of the natural gas distribution system, or (2) inspection and maintenance programs for such system.\n\nIn awarding grants under the program, DOE must prioritize applications based on the expected results of a project with respect to (1) quantifiable benefits for public safety, (2) the magnitude of methane emissions reductions, (3) innovation in technical or policy approaches, (4) the number of low-income households anticipated to benefit from the assistance, and (5) overall cost-effectiveness of the project."
