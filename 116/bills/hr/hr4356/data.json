It treats as individuals covered, and therefore allowed to terminate such a contract (1) a spouse or dependent of a service member who dies while in military service or a member of the reserve components performing full-time or active reserve duty or inactive-duty training; (2) a spouse or dependent of a service member who incurs a catastrophic injury or illness, if the member incurs the injury or illness while in military service or performing such duty; and (3) a member of the reserve components performing such duty."
