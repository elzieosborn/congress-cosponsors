  <summary date="2021-01-14T14:37:24Z" status="Public Law">Protecting Families of Fallen Servicemembers Act

This bill revises the conditions allowing a service member to terminate a commercial mobile, telephone exchange, internet access, or multichannel video programming service contract at any time after the date the service member receives military orders to relocate for at least 90 days to a location that does not support such contract. It treats as individuals covered, and therefore allowed to terminate such a contract (1) a spouse or dependent of a service member who dies while in military service or a member of the reserve components performing full-time or active reserve duty or inactive-duty training; (2) a spouse or dependent of a service member who incurs a catastrophic injury or illness, if the member incurs the injury or illness while in military service or performing such duty; and (3) a member of the reserve components performing such duty.</summary>
