  <summary date="2021-01-07T15:02:52Z" status="Introduced in House">Honor the Heroes Act of 2019

This bill modifies the funding and administration of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001.

The bill provides appropriations for the fund in specified amounts through FY2025, whereas current law provides such appropriations as may be necessary through FY2092. Additionally, beginning in FY2020, the bill redirects to the fund a portion of the annual discretionary budgets for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Commerce.

The bill also shortens a deadline for claimants to file certain claims for compensation from the fund.</summary>
