Additionally, beginning in FY2020, the bill redirects to the fund a portion of the annual discretionary budgets for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Commerce.\n\nThe bill also shortens a deadline for claimants to file certain claims for compensation from the fund."
