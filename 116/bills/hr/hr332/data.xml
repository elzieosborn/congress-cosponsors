This bill revises House of Representatives procedures for considering joint resolutions related to weapons and defense services sales to foreign countries, export licenses for such weapons and services, and technical assistance or manufacturing agreements with foreign countries.

Currently, the President must provide certification supporting such an action, which can go forward unless Congress enacts a joint resolution opposing it. The bill provides for rules such as who may make a motion to discharge the resolution from committee and time limits on debate.</summary>
