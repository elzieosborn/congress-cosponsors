  <summary date="2021-04-19T21:38:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires states and physician licensing boards to promote interstate medical practice and interstate telemedicine, respectively. It does this by adding conditions to certain funding managed by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).

Specifically, to receive funding from HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce, states must join the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact within three years. This compact expedites multistate licensing of qualified physicians.

Additionally, to receive certain grants to address barriers to telemedicine, physician licensing boards must carry out campaigns to encourage interstate telemedicine use by specialists. The bill also reauthorizes these grants from FY2021-FY2025.</summary>
