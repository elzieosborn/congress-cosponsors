This bill expands protections for whistleblowers who are employed by a covered agency in the intelligence community (or by a contractor of such an agency) to apply to protected disclosures made to any Member of Congress. Currently, when a protected disclosure is made to Congress, whistleblower protections generally apply only if the disclosure was made to a congressional intelligence committee or to a member of such a committee.</summary>
