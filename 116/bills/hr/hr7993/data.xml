  <summary date="2020-12-14T14:28:33Z" status="Introduced in House">Promoting and Advancing Communities of Color through Inclusive Lending Act 

This bill revises requirements applicable to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and addresses lending during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

The bill establishes mandatory set-asides for (1) minority CDFIs under the CDFI Fund, and (2) CDFIs and MDIs under existing COVID-19 economic aid programs.

The bill also establishes an impact bank designation for certain small depository institutions that lend primarily to low-income borrowers and establishes programs for impact banks and MDIs regarding investments, technical assistance, and federal government deposits.

Finally, the Department of the Treasury must provide capital and interest-free loans to CDFIs, MDIs, impact banks, and credit unions that primarily serve low-income, underserved communities. The bill also reduces the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program minimum issuance amount from $100 million to $25 million for FY2020 and to $50 million for fiscal years thereafter.</summary>
