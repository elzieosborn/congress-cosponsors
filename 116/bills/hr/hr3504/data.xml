  <summary date="2022-02-15T22:15:50Z" status="Public Law">Ryan Kules and Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of 2019

This bill revises the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Specially Adapted Housing Program and updates provisions related to educational assistance and the work-study allowance for veterans.

The Specially Adapted Housing Program provides grants to veterans and service members with certain service-connected disabilities to assist with constructing, purchasing, or remodeling homes to fit their needs. The program is comprised of two grants (1) the Specially Adapted Housing grant (for acquisition of housing with special features), and (2) the Special Housing Adaptation grant (for adaptations to a veteran's residence).

Specifically, the bill updates the eligibility for the program by including veterans with certain visual impairments and requiring those with the loss or loss of use of a lower extremity to meet other qualifications.

 The bill raises the cap on grants that may be issued per veteran from three to six and raises the number of applications that may be approved for the Specially Adapted Housing grant from 30 to 120. The bill increases the maximum amount of assistance available under the Special Housing Adaptation grant program and also increases the aggregate amount of assistance available under both grant programs.

The bill also authorizes certain veterans to apply for additional assistance under both grants, subject to specified limitations.

Under the bill, individuals who are entitled to educational assistance through the Post-9/11 GI Bill are also entitled to payment for a covered preparatory course for licensure, certification, or national tests.

The bill updates provisions related to the work-study allowance benefit available to eligible veterans, including by prescribing the annual amount the VA must provide to educational institutions for the program.

Finally, the bill modifies the loan fee table under the VA's home loan guaranty program.</summary>
