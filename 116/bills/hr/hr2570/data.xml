  <summary date="2020-04-03T21:15:37Z" status="Introduced in House">PFAS User Fee Act of 2019

This bill creates a fee to provide support for the treatment of drinking water contaminated with certain perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS. These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must establish a fee for the manufacture of PFAS. Revenue generated from the fees must be made available for&#160;a grant program. Under the program, the EPA must make grants&#160;to pay for the removal of PFAS from drinking water systems and wastewater treatment works.</summary>
