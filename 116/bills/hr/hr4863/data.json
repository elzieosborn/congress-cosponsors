    "text": "United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019\n\nThis bill reauthorizes the U.S. Export-Import Bank through FY2029 and otherwise modifies its operations.\n\nSpecifically, the bill redesignates the bank as the United States Export Finance Agency and increases its lending cap over the period of its reauthorization. In the event of a quorum lapse, the bill provides for the establishment of a temporary board to act in the stead of the Board of Directors. The bill also prohibits the agency from providing financing for certain specified entities and persons involved in sanctionable activities.\n\nAdditionally, the agency must establish (1) the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion to increase the participation of such groups in the agency's programs and contracts; (2) the Office of Territorial Exporting to promote the export of goods and services from U.S. territories; and (3) the Office of Financing for Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Energy Storage Exports to promote exports used in the production of renewable energy resources and energy efficiency technologies.\n\nFurther, the agency is authorized to (1) deem as met certain prerequisite considerations to providing competitive export financing in the case of exports likely to be supported by official financing from China; and (2) establish a program under which it may enter into arrangements (i.e., reinsurance pools) to share risks associated with the extension of credit."
