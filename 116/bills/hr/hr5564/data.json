The bill also prohibits the FCC from making certain revisions to the reporting requirements on commercial broadcast station ownership.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires the FCC to include such ownership data in its biennial communications marketplace report and to analyze how such data relates to market entry barriers that prevent diversity in media ownership. The FCC must also create a public, searchable database of media ownership information."
