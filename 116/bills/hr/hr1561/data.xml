This bill prohibits certain federal agencies from granting a relative of the President access to classified information for purposes of federal employment unless the Office of Government Ethics makes a favorable determination during a review process regarding the relative's suitability for such access. In conducting a review, the office must determine whether the relative of the President has any ongoing and substantial commercial relationships with state-owned or privately-owned foreign enterprises or financial institutions and, if so, whether the relative is ineligible for access to classified information because of such relationships.</summary>
