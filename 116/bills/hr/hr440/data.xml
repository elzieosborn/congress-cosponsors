This bill states that when the government seeks to obtain land or land rights essential to control or guard a U.S. land border, it may not take such land or land rights until a final judgment has been issued in a condemnation proceeding initiated under judicial process. The bill also transfers the authority to obtain such land rights from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security.</summary>
