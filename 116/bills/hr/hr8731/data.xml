This bill directs the Forest Service to fill vacancies in National Forests for Forest Service recreation management and planning staff, including recreation technicians, recreation officers, and natural resource managers.

In seeking to fill vacancies, the Forest Service shall prioritize filling vacancies in National Forests that (1) are at high or very high risk of catastrophic wildfires, (2) are located in or near the wildland-urban interface, and (3) have experienced an increase in visitation over the past decade.

The Forest Service may provide the opportunity for any individual who fills a vacancy to receive training and certification as a Forest Protection Officer.</summary>
