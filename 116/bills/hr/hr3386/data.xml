This bill limits the liability of uninsured individuals in relation to certain hospital costs. Specifically, a hospital or critical access hospital may not hold such individuals liable for more than the lowest negotiated price that the hospital charges a health insurer or group health plan. Hospitals that impose greater liability shall be subject to specified civil monetary penalties.</summary>
