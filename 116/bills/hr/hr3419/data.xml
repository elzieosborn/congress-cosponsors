  <summary date="2021-11-30T18:12:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Halt Unchecked Member Benefits with Lobbying Elimination Act or the HUMBLE Act

This bill places limits on certain activities of Members and elected officers of Congress.

The bill imposes a permanent ban on lobbying contacts by a former Senator (currently, a two-year ban), a former Member of the House of Representatives (currently, a one-year ban), or a former elected officer of the House or Senate (currently, a one-year ban).

The bill prohibits federal funds made available for the official travel of a Member or other officer or employee of the legislative branch from being used for airline accommodations that are not coach-class accommodations.

Such prohibition is inapplicable for an individual if the use would be permitted for an employee of an agency subject to specified federal regulations for temporary duty travel allowances.

Certain benefits and services are eliminated for former Members of the House (e.g., access to the House chamber, the Member's Dining Room, or parking spaces) unless the benefits or services are made available to the public.

Finally, the bill prohibits Members of the House from owning the common stock of any individual corporation.</summary>
