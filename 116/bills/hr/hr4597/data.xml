This bill eliminates cost-sharing for biosimilar biological products for certain qualifying beneficiaries under Medicare medical services. Specifically, the bill eliminates cost-sharing for beneficiaries whose coverage under private health insurance, a federal program (other than Medicare), a Medicare supplemental policy, or Medicare Advantage does not already do so. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must establish a process for determining a beneficiary's eligibility and notifying Medicare Advantage organizations of such determinations.</summary>
