This bill requires an air carrier receiving federal loans or grants under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) to certify to the Department of Transportation that it will reimburse a consumer amounts paid for a flight canceled by such air carrier or the consumer during the COVID-19 emergency period.

 The requirement does not apply in the case of a passenger who was reimbursed amounts paid by a third party or through travel protection insurance.</summary>
