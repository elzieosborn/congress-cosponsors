This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to take various actions related to counterintelligence activities, such as identifying academic fields that are sensitive for homeland security and counterintelligence purposes. The bill also requires a national securities exchange to prohibit the initial listing of a security if the issuer files with the Securities and Exchange Commission an audit report prepared by a foreign public accounting firm that the Public Accounting Oversight Board is unable to inspect or investigate. In addition, the bill allows an eligible taxpayer to expense certain costs associated with moving manufacturing capacity from China to the United States.</summary>
