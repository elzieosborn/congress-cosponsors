This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish within two months a publicly accessible clearinghouse of information about personal protective equipment used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) or other pathogens that trigger public health emergency declarations.

The clearinghouse must identify sources of available equipment, verify product prices, and provide other information to facilitate the procurement of these products. Participation in this clearinghouse by suppliers of personal protective equipment must be voluntary.</summary>
