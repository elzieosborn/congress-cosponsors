The program enables accountable care organizations (ACOs) to receive payments for savings stemming from care coordination and management.\n\nAmong other changes, the bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to increase the shared savings rate for participating ACOs, as specified, and to establish a program that assists ACOs with start-up and operational costs of participation. The bill also extends certain incentive payments for health professionals who participate in eligible alternative payment models."
