This bill modifies requirements with respect to the prerelease placement of inmates in residential reentry centers. Specifically, it requires the Bureau of Prisons to place a prisoner in a residential reentry center that is within 50 miles of the prisoner's previous or anticipated permanent legal address, subject to bed space availability. A prisoner may waive the right to be placed in such a center for reasons such as health or safety.</summary>
