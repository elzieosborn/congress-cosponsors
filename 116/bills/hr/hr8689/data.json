In the case of grants, priority must be given to eligible entities that serve particular youth with a barrier to employment, youth of color, opportunity youth or out-of-school youth, low-income youth, and youth impacted by the juvenile or adult criminal justice systems.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report on the activities funded by this bill.\n\nThe bill excludes from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program income eligibility requirements income earned by a household member who is less than 22 years of age, is an elementary or secondary school student, and lives with a natural, adoptive, or stepparent."
