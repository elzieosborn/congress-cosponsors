This bill requires the Department of Labor, in the implementation of the Transition Assistance Program, to provide information concerning apprenticeship programs to members of the Armed Forces who are separating from active duty.

The bill expands an existing monthly housing stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill by authorizing the stipend to be used for other purposes.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in coordination with Labor, must establish a publicly accessible and user-friendly website on which veterans can find specified information about apprenticeship programs that are approved under VA education benefit provisions.</summary>
