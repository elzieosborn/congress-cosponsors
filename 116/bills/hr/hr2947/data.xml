This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to develop guidelines regarding the use by the military departments and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of unofficial sources of information to determine the eligibility of a member or former member of the Armed Forces for benefits and decorations when the member's service records are incomplete because of damage from the 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri, or any subsequent incident while the records were in DOD's possession.

DOD shall prepare the guidelines in consultation with the VA with respect to veterans benefits whose eligibility determinations depend on the use of service records maintained by DOD.</summary>
