  <summary date="2020-06-16T13:15:14Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill allows a refundable income tax credit for state income taxes paid by individuals providing services as first responders, doctors, nurses, or other health or emergency services.

The bill requires a reduction in federal highway funds paid to a state that corresponds to the credit amount allowed by this bill.</summary>
