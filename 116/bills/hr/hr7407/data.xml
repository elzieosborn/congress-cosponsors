This bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using federal funds to support needle exchange or syringe exchange programs.

Historically, language in appropriations bills prohibited federal funds from being used to support these programs. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 authorized federal support for them under certain circumstances, provided no funds are used to purchase needles or syringes.</summary>
