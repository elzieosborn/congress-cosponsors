This bill revises the federal charter for the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association.

Specifically, it makes the following changes:

 eliminates the provision that requires the foundation to be incorporated and domiciled in the District of Columbia; requires the board of directors to decide, and specify in the bylaws, the location of the principal office; specifies that the bylaws&#8212;not the charter&#8212;must provide for the terms of membership, the responsibilities of the board of directors, and the election of officers; prohibits a director or officer, in his or her corporate capacity, from contributing to, supporting, or participating in political activities; allows income and assets of the corporation to be used to reasonably compensate or reimburse expenses of an officer, director, or member; to award a grant to the Federal Bar Association chapter of an officer, director, or member; and to reasonably compensate employees; expands a prohibition on loans for directors and officers to include members and employees; and specifies that on dissolution or final liquidation, any remaining assets must be distributed as provided by the board of directors instead of deposited in the Treasury.</summary>
