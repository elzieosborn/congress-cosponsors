This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to treat certain clinical services that are furnished by an excepted off-campus outpatient department of a provider (i.e., a department that would be considered an off-campus outpatient department but for certain statutory exceptions) during a specified period as though such services were provided on-campus for purposes of Medicare payment. (In November 2018, the CMS issued regulations that applied a lower Medicare payment rate for such services.)</summary>
