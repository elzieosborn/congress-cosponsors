This bill expands the list of actions that may result in the change of control of an institution of higher education (IHE) to include a court-ordered receivership.

Such changes of control disqualify an IHE from participating in certain federal student financial aid programs unless the IHE establishes that it meets specific requirements following the change in control.</summary>
