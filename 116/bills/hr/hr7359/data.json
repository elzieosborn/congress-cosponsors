The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a mechanism through which the FCC finances high-speed broadband networks in unserved rural areas.\n\nRecipients of amounts from the Accelerating Broadband Connectivity Fund shall use such funds to (1) begin construction of a broadband network, (2) make broadband available from the network deployed using Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support, and (3) meet all build-out obligations pursuant to receiving amounts from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund."
