This bill prohibits certain government officials and their family members from holding foreign financial interests and also requires divestiture of any such interests in a prescribed manner and time frame. Specifically, the bill prohibits the President, cabinet officials, and Members of Congress from holding any financial interest in, or receiving payment from, a foreign business. Such individuals must divest any such interest by either converting the interest into cash or another investment, or by placing the interest in a qualified blind trust or diversified trust; divestiture must occur no later than 30 days after either the issuance of implementing regulations or after the individual takes office. The bill's requirements apply to the spouses, children, sons-in-law, and daughters-in-law of such individuals.</summary>
