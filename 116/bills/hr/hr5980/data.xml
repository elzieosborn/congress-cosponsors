This bill makes a Member of Congress who has been convicted of a crime related to public corruption ineligible between the date of sentencing and the date of final conviction to receive retirement payments pursuant to the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System based on their service as a Member.

Under current law, a Member must forgo receipt of these payments only after a final conviction (i.e., after the exhaustion of all appeals under the judicial process).</summary>
