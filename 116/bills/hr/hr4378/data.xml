Highlights 

This bill provides continuing FY2020 appropriations to federal agencies through November 21, 2019.

It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur if the FY2020 appropriations bills have not been enacted when FY2020 begins on October 1, 2019.

The CR funds most projects and activities at the FY2019 levels with several exceptions that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs.

The bill also extends several expiring programs and authorities, including several health care programs.
