This bill revises the authority for state grants to improve the reporting of unidentified and missing persons.

Specifically, the bill

 authorizes grants to be used for additional activities (e.g., transportation of missing persons and unidentified remains), including with respect to migrants; and expands eligible entities. The bill also requires the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deploy rescue beacons along the southern border to mitigate migrant deaths.</summary>
