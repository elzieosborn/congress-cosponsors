This bill prohibits funds made available to the Department of Defense for FY2019 from being used to reduce the number of U.S. Armed Forces members deployed in Afghanistan to below 10,000 unless the Office of the Director of National Intelligence certifies that Taliban leaders have (1) rejected Al Qaeda by name, (2) committed not to fight alongside or have any affiliation with Al Qaeda, and (3) agreed to various conditions such as committing to protecting the rights of women and girls and supporting the Afghan Constitution.

The Department of State shall provide briefings to Congress every 30 days regarding any ongoing talks with the Afghan government or the Taliban and the effect of such talks on Armed Forces in Afghanistan.</summary>
