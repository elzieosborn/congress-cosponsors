This bill revises the calculation of age of eligibility for retired pay for members of the Ready Reserve so that days of active duty or active service after October 7, 2001, (the start of combat operations in Afghanistan) reduce a member's age of eligibility. Currently, active duty or active service days after January 28, 2008, reduce a member's age of eligibility. The bill is retroactive to October 7, 2001.</summary>
