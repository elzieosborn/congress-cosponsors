DIVISION G--ENERGY AND COMMERCE\n\nThis division creates the Office of Internet Connectivity and Growth, and it provides funding for programs that (1) promote digital equity and broadband capacity building, (2) provide discounts on phone service for low-income consumers, and (3) subsidize internet services for schools and libraries. The bill also establishes specified transparency requirements, such as making federal broadband data available to local governments and changing the way broadband data is collected, disputed, and reported. Further, the bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to redefine unserved and underserved communities and to update its rules permitting Wi-Fi access on school buses. The bill also prohibits states from erecting barriers to locally owned broadband networks.\n\nThe division establishes requirements related to motor vehicle safety, including rulemakings for crash avoidance, updating the 5-Star Safety Rating System, and establishing standards to reduce injuries and fatalities suffered by pedestrians and cyclists struck by motor vehicles.\n\nThe division provides funding for certain energy and infrastructure measures, including grant programs to (1) assist water utilities with treatment for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, (2) assist rural electric cooperatives or nonprofit entities with designing and demonstrating energy storage and microgrid projects using renewable energy sources, and (3) construct or install community solar facilities that serve multi-family affordable housing. Further, the bill establishes a rebate program, requirements, and funding for specified energy efficiency retrofits.\n\nThe division also allows a tax credit for purchasing zero-emission vehicles and supports deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.\n\nThe division provides funds to increase hospital capacity and support community health centers in their response to COVID-19.\n\nDIVISION H--ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS\n\n This division addresses various provisions, including those related to the national scenic byways program, the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to passenger or freight transportation facilities, and certain transportation policies.\n\nAmong other provisions, this division\n\n reauthorizes appropriations through FY2025 for the national scenic byways program; requires, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the owners and operators of equipment or facilities used by passenger or freight transportation employers to implement personal protective equipment and disinfection and sanitization procedures, and air carriers to submit to the FAA a proposal to permit pilots to wear masks or protective face coverings in the flight deck; authorizes the U.S. Geological Survey to fund, through a cooperative agreement with an academic partner, the design, construction, and tenant build-out of a facility to support energy and minerals research and appurtenant associated structures; requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study to identify the impact of certain transportation policies on people based on their race, ethnicity, nationality, age, disability status, and gender identity; and directs the Department of Labor to award implementation or renewal grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible industry or sector partnerships to achieve certain strategic objectives with respect to targeted infrastructure industries (e.g., transportation, construction, energy, information technology, or utilities industries). DIVISION I--ZERO-EMISSION POSTAL FLEET AND OTHER MATTERS\n\nThis division authorizes appropriations to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for the modernization of postal infrastructure and operations, including through capital expenditures to purchase delivery vehicles, processing equipment, trailers, and other goods. The USPS must ensure that at least 75% of the total number of vehicles purchased using such funds are electric or zero-emission vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, not later than January 1, 2026, the USPS must provide at least one electric vehicle charging station at each publicly available postal facility for use by the public or its employees.\n\nDIVISION J--COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\n This division expands and otherwise modifies various housing and community development programs. Specifically, the division authorizes additional assistance under the following programs\n\n the Multifamily Preservation and Revitalization demonstration program, the Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant program, the Native American Housing Block Grant program, the HOME Investment Partnership program, the Community Development Block Grant program, supportive housing for individuals with disabilities and for the elderly, and single-family repair loans and grants for very low-income homeowners in rural areas.
