This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish the Committee on Building Back American Manufacturing to review and report on the strength, integrity, and capacity of the manufacturing base of the United States and supply chain for crucial, strategic resources and products in the United States.

The duties of the committee shall include (1) developing proposals to diversify production lines within the United States; (2) recommending policy proposals to improve production and acquisition of critical products and supplies where access can be severely limited in the event of global supply chain disruption; and (3) reviewing ways to disseminate best practices, technical expertise, funding or financing opportunities, and fostering industry collaborations that improve the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.</summary>
