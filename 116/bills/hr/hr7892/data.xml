This bill alters certain provisions relating to Medicaid presumptive eligibility for pregnant women, children, breast and cervical cancer patients, and patients of certain family planning services. (Presumptive eligibility allows qualifying individuals to receive services before their applications are fully processed.)

Specifically, the bill extends the applicable presumptive eligibility periods by five months. The bill also provides a 100% Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) to states for expenses related to such eligibility determinations during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).</summary>
