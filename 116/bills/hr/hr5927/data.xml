  <summary date="2021-09-07T20:22:15Z" status="Introduced in House">Safe Medicine Act

This bill authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to temporarily ban the sale of a drug if (1) the drug (or an active ingredient of the drug) is manufactured in a country that, because of systemic problems of supervision, may be producing contaminated drugs; and (2) the drug's labeling does not have certain warnings about potential contamination.

The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on vulnerabilities in the U.S. medicine supply chain, including vulnerabilities related to reliance on production from other countries.</summary>
