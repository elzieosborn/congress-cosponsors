  <summary date="2021-05-25T15:22:10Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill extends to all domestic corporations (including S corporations) the deferral of tax on certain sales of employer stock to employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) and reduces certain retirement-related excise taxes.

Specifically, the bill reduces excise tax rates of certain excess accumulations in tax-exempt retirement plans and on failures to take required minimum distributions from such plans. It also allows employers who establish a tax-exempt 403(b) pension plan to participate in a multiple employer plan.

The bill extends the tax credit for small employer pension plan startup costs to employers that join an existing plan.</summary>
