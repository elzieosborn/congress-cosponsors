    "text": "This bill extends to all domestic corporations (including S corporations) the deferral of tax on certain sales of employer stock to employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) and reduces certain retirement-related excise taxes.\n\nSpecifically, the bill reduces excise tax rates of certain excess accumulations in tax-exempt retirement plans and on failures to take required minimum distributions from such plans. It also allows employers who establish a tax-exempt 403(b) pension plan to participate in a multiple employer plan.\n\nThe bill extends the tax credit for small employer pension plan startup costs to employers that join an existing plan."
