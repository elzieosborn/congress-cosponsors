    "text": "Corporal Ronil Singh and Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act\n\nThis bill eliminates the expected family contribution (EFC) used to determine financial need in the case of a Pell Grant-eligible student whose spouse died as a result of performing military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, or while in the line of duty as a police officer, firefighter, or other public safety officer. Such a student is eligible to receive an automatic zero EFC and qualifies for the maximum Pell Grant award if the student was younger than 24 years old or enrolled at an institution of higher education at the time of the spouse's death. Currently, the automatic zero EFC provision applies only to a Pell Grant-eligible student whose parent or guardian died in the line of duty.\n\nThe bill also modifies the calculation of the increased Pell Grant award for these students."
