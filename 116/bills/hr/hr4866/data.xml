  <summary date="2021-09-10T13:35:54Z" status="Introduced in House">National Centers of Excellence in Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Act of 2019

This bill directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to designate qualified institutions of higher education as National Centers of Excellence in Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and to provide grants to the centers. Each designated center must conduct research on continuous manufacturing technologies and must share information from such research with the FDA. (Currently, most drug production involves batch manufacturing, which typically takes longer than continuous manufacturing processes.)</summary>
