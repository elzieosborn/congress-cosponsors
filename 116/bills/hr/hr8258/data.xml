This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct an advanced fuel cycle research, development, demonstration, and commercial application program for spent nuclear fuel. The program must improve fuel cycle performance and support a variety of options for used nuclear fuel storage, use, and disposal, including advanced nuclear reactor concepts. In carrying out the program, DOE must ensure all activities and designs incorporate state of the art safeguards technologies and techniques to reduce risk of proliferation. In addition, DOE must consider the potential benefits and other impacts of those activities for civilian nuclear applications, environmental health and safety, and national security. DOE must also consider the economic viability of all activities and designs.</summary>
