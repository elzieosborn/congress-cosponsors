This bill modifies allowable and forgivable uses of amounts received under the Paycheck Protection Program, established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), to encompass costs related to the provision of personal protective equipment or other equipment or supplies necessary to protect the health and safety of employees.

The bill also prohibits the Small Business Administration from limiting the non-payroll portion of a forgivable loan amount.</summary>
