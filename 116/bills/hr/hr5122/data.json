Specifically, the Department of Justice shall establish the National Foreign Agents Database, which shall be a publicly searchable, sortable, and machine-processable database of the information contained in such registrations.\u00a0Current law\u00a0requires a database of registrations to have search and sort functions only to the extent technically practicable.\n\nFARA-required registrations shall be filed in an electronic, structured data format. Electronically filed registrations shall be immediately available to the public over the internet."
