    "text": "Woman's Right To Know Act\n\nThis bill specifies requirements for\u00a0informed consent that health care providers must obtain before performing an abortion procedure.\n\nProviders must present a woman seeking an abortion with an authorization form at least 24 hours before performing the procedure. The form must (1) include specified information concerning gestational age, associated developmental characteristics,\u00a0and medical risks; (2) disclose penalties\u00a0that\u00a0providers may face for failing to obtain the requisite informed consent; and (3) include an affirmation that the individual signing the form understands the information. The form must be signed and witnessed in person and retained in the medical file.\n\nProviders do not\u00a0have to obtain such consent if, in reasonable medical judgment, obtaining it would pose a greater risk of death or substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function, excluding psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant woman.\n\nThe bill also establishes civil penalties for providers who do not comply with these requirements."
