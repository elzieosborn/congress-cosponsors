Specifically, states may use grants to (1) automatically enroll individuals who are eligible for a premium assistance tax credit, (2) invest in data-collection technology, (3) establish a statewide requirement to purchase minimum coverage, and (4) study the feasibility of developing a state plan to increase health insurance enrollment. Private insurance issuers and states must report monthly to HHS about individuals who disenroll from coverage, including Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program."
