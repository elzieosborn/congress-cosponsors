(An affidavit of support is a contract in which the sponsor agrees to financially support the alien during the alien's stay in the United States, if necessary.)\n\nThe Department of State may waive any of these requirements for public interest purposes, such as to assure family unity.\n\nThe period of stay for a B-3 visa may be for up to 120 days."
