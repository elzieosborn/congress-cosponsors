This bill establishes a new nonimmigrant visa category (B-3) for an eligible alien to enter the United States to visit certain relatives.

To qualify for a B-3 visa, the alien must (1) be visiting a qualifying relative (such as a child, parent, uncle, or aunt) who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, (2) have an affidavit of support executed by the U.S.-based relative or another sponsor, and (3) have travel medical insurance covering the duration of the visit. (An affidavit of support is a contract in which the sponsor agrees to financially support the alien during the alien's stay in the United States, if necessary.)

The Department of State may waive any of these requirements for public interest purposes, such as to assure family unity.

The period of stay for a B-3 visa may be for up to 120 days.</summary>
