This bill provides for the&#160;use of trauma-informed practices in public elementary and secondary schools and allows states to use certain federal funds to train teachers in such practices.

Trauma-informed practices are defined to include

 evidence-based professional development that promotes a shared understanding among teachers and other staff that traumatic experiences are common among students and that school-wide learning environments where all students and adults feel safe, welcomed, and supported can enable students to succeed despite such experiences; adoption of disciplinary procedures and practices that utilize evidence-based restorative practices that build a culture of trust; and activities that engage teachers and other staff in a process of school-based planning to help all students feel safe and connected to the school community.</summary>
