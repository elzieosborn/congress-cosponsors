(Sec. 3) This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior to issue guidance related to certain community land grants in New Mexico made by Spain or Mexico to individuals, groups, and communities to promote the settlement of the southwestern United States (land grant-mercedes).

The guidance shall set forth the policies and procedures for notice and comment on planning decisions, routine engagement, and major federal actions that could impact historical-traditional uses of a qualified land grant-merced.

(Sec. 4) In developing, maintaining, and revising land management plans and National Forest System land and resource management plans, as applicable, the USDA or Interior shall consider and, as appropriate, provide for and evaluate impacts to historical-traditional uses by qualified land grant-mercedes.

(Sec. 5) The USDA shall initiate negotiated rulemaking procedures to promulgate such regulations as are necessary to carry out and implement the Forest Service's Acequia Guidance Document, dated July 2, 2019.</summary>
