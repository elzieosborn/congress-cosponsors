The State Department shall seek to double the number of women receiving training under its Anti-Terrorism Assistance programs within three years of this bill's enactment.\n\nThe State Department, DOD, and the U.S. Agency for International Development shall conduct research on gender and countering violent extremism, including best practices to support women preventing violent extremism, and utilize the results of such research in their programs.
