This bill establishes a new criminal offense for preventing emergency medical technicians assigned to ambulances or other emergency vehicles from providing medical care. It also makes it a criminal offense to block an emergency vehicle that is transporting an individual in need of treatment from a hospital entrance.

An individual who engages in this conduct is subject to criminal penalties--a fine, a prison term of up to five years, or both. If death results, the prison term may be for any term of years or for life.</summary>
