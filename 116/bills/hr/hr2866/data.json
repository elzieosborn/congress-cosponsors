Community infrastructure includes any (1) transportation project; (2) flood or natural disaster mitigation project; (3) hospital, police, fire, emergency response, or other community support facility; or (4) utility infrastructure projects owned by a state or local government.\n\nAssistance shall be available where the VA determines such assistance will enhance the resilience of the medical facility or quality of life of veterans eligible to receive care at such facilities."
