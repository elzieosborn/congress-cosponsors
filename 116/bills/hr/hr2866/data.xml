This bill authorizes a 10-year pilot program under which the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may assist state and local governments in addressing deficiencies in community infrastructure that is supportive of VA medical facilities by making grants, concluding cooperative agreements, and supplementing funds available under other federal programs. Community infrastructure includes any (1) transportation project; (2) flood or natural disaster mitigation project; (3) hospital, police, fire, emergency response, or other community support facility; or (4) utility infrastructure projects owned by a state or local government.

Assistance shall be available where the VA determines such assistance will enhance the resilience of the medical facility or quality of life of veterans eligible to receive care at such facilities.</summary>
