The USGS may provide grants to research, map, assess, and collect data on landslide hazards.\n\nThe National Science Foundation may provide grants to eligible entities for landslide research.\n\nThe USGS (1) shall advance the identification, mapping, research, and monitoring of subsidence and groundwater resource accounting, particularly in areas affected by drought; (2) shall establish the 3D Elevation Program and the 3D Elevation Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee; and (3) may make grants and enter into cooperative agreements to facilitate the improvement of nationwide coverage of 3D elevation data."
