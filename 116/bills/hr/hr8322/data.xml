This bill authorizes the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to waive certain limitations with respect to Medicare coverage of hospice care during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Specifically, the CMS may allow respite care to be provided in other settings besides inpatient facilities and may allow such care to be provided for up to 15 (rather than up to 5) consecutive days.</summary>
