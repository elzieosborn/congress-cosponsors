This bill establishes the Entry Adjudication through General Legal Expertise Corps (EAGLE Corps) within the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the purpose of addressing inefficiencies in the administration of immigration laws. The EAGLE Corps shall provide legal services for the United States before the immigration courts and also provide administrative and support services.

Each EAGLE Corps member may serve for up to 24 months.

The bill directs the Department of Education to establish a loan repayment program for repaying certain education loans. DOJ may recruit for potential EAGLE Corps members in law schools, including but not limited to those who may serve pursuant to the loan repayment program.

DOJ may establish fellowship programs for attorneys who have an interest and commitment to serving&#160;in the&#160;EAGLE Corps.</summary>
