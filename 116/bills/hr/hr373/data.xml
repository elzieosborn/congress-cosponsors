This bill allows&#160;administrative or judicial review of certain decisions by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) relating to the Medicare Primary Care Incentive Payment Program. (The program authorized additional payments to certain primary-care practitioners who provided primary-care services on or after January 1, 2011, and before January 1, 2016.)

Current law prohibits administrative or judicial review of CMS decisions regarding the eligibility of primary-care practitioners to receive incentive payments under the program. The bill authorizes review of such decisions in cases where the practitioner failed to meet eligibility criteria due to a coding error for provided items and services.</summary>
