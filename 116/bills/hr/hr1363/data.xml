This bill requires each authorized candidate committee or leadership political action committee (PAC) to disburse all unused funds within a specified time period beginning after an election, unless the candidate files to run for office again before the disbursement period begins. A committee or PAC disbursing unspent funds shall first pay any obligations incurred and, if funds are left over, it may disburse the funds in specified ways, such as by&#160;transferring the funds to a national or state committee of a political party.</summary>
