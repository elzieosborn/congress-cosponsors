This bill authorizes the Department of State to pay a reward to anyone who furnishes certain information relating to foreign election interference by a foreign entity or an individual who is not a U.S. person.

Foreign election interference is conduct by a foreign person that (1) violates federal criminal, voting rights, or campaign finance law; or (2) is performed by any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of a foreign government or criminal enterprise. Such conduct may include any covert, fraudulent, deceptive, or unlawful act undertaken with the purpose or effect of undermining public confidence in election processes or institutions.</summary>
