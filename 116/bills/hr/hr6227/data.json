    "text": "Privacy Score Act of 2020 This bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop a framework for issuing privacy scores to interactive computer services. Specifically, the FTC must base the framework on criteria such as the type of user information the service collects and the security of any sensitive information that may be used to identify users of the service. Further, the FTC must issue, periodically evaluate, and publish scores based on the established framework for interactive computer services with a large number of unique U.S. users."
