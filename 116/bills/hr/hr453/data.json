These lands include the Sequoyah Museum, the Chota Memorial, the Tanasi Memorial, and land to provide support for these properties and cultural programs.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) maintains its right to carry out river control and development on these lands, including temporarily and intermittently flooding certain lands. The bill specifies the structures that may be constructed with the TVA's consent on certain lands subject to flooding. Additionally, the TVA must be compensated for lost hydropower capacity from future development of these lands.\n\nThe bill prohibits the United States from being liable for loss or damage resulting from certain activities, such as the flooding of certain lands.\n\nThe bill outlines TVA's continuing responsibilities, including those related to environmental remediation.\n\nGaming on these lands is prohibited."
