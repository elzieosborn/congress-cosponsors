It also provides grants for projects that may have combined heat and power and energy storage as project components.\n\nStates must use at least 40% of grant funds to implement projects in environmental justice communities or low-income communities that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.\n\nNo funds may be used for a project unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States, with specified exceptions.\n\nThe bill also directs DOE to hire a specified number of employees to carry out the grant program, including at least 300 full-time employees in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy."
