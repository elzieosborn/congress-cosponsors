This bill establishes the Office of the Borrower Advocate to replace the Student Loan Ombudsman that is currently responsible for informally resolving complaints from student loan borrowers.

The office established by the bill shall (1) assist student loan borrowers in resolving problems with the Office of Federal Student Aid; (2) compile, analyze, publish, and attempt to resolve borrowers' complaints; and (3) make recommendations with respect to federal student loan programs and the experiences of borrowers in repayment under such programs. The bill also places additional requirements on the office, such as making certain student loan oversight information available to the public.</summary>
