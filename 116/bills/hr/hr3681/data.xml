  <summary date="2020-01-21T15:06:08Z" status="Introduced in House">Green Spaces, Green Vehicles Act of 2019

This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE), the Forest Service, and the National Park Service (NPS) (appropriate agencies) to collaborate on the Green Spaces, Green Vehicles Initiative to facilitate the installation and use of zero-emissions vehicle infrastructure on National Forest System lands, NPS lands, and specified lands owned by units of local government or Indian tribes.

DOE and such appropriate agencies shall facilitate such installation and use, including by acquiring zero-emissions vehicles for the fleets of the Forest Service and the NPS.

For purposes of determining whether the acquisition of alternative fueled vehicles is practical for the fleet of the Forest Service or the NPS, DOE shall take into account the availability on National Forest System land or NPS land, as applicable, of zero-emissions vehicle infrastructure.</summary>
