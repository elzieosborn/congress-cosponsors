This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to provide secured loans or loan guarantees to private entities for the construction of common carrier pipelines that transport anthropogenic carbon dioxide as a supercritical fluid.

The bill prohibits DOT from providing loans to finance more than one common carrier trunk pipeline project of which the majority of the pipeline will be constructed in a single census region.

DOT must give priority to projects that propose construction of a common carrier trunk pipeline project in an area where pipelines or other linear infrastructure already exist.

DOT may provide loans only if all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States, with specified exceptions.</summary>
