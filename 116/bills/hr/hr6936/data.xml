This bill requires the Department of Commerce to study and report on the impact of the gig economy on U.S. businesses conducting interstate commerce.

Such study shall involve, among other things, (1) outreach to participating entities to establish a list of industry sectors that take part in the gig economy, (2) surveying federal activity on the gig economy to develop a list of agencies asserting jurisdiction over entities in and sectors of the gig economy, and (3) surveying state laws regulating the gig economy to determine their impact on both the gig economy and the U.S. economy.

Commerce must report to Congress the results of such study and any recommendations to promote the growth of the gig economy.</summary>
