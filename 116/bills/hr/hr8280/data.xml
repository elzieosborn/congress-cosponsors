This bill preempts any state law that classifies an individual providing labor or services for remuneration (i.e., an independent contractor) as an employee for purposes of wage-rate and benefit requirements.

The bill also&#160;broadens the existing Securities and Exchange Commission registration exemption for the issuance of securities as part of an employee-compensation package. Specifically, the bill applies this exemption to the issuance of securities&#160;as compensation for&#160;independent contractors.

The Government Accountability Office must report on the&#160;bill's effects.&#160;</summary>
