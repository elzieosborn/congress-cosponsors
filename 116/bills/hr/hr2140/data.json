The strategy shall include a mandate to collect and report data on suspected child marriages, protocols for preventing child marriages, and programs to support and rehabilitate victims of such marriages.\n\nThe Permanent Representative shall also advocate for the U.N. to (1) examine\u00a0the relationship between child marriage and violence against girls in all of its research into child marriage, and (2) adopt a standard definition of \"child marriage.\""
