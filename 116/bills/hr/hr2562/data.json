    "text": "Advancing International and Foreign Language Education Act\n\nThis bill reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise revises international education programs. These programs provide grants to institutions of higher education and related entities to (1) enhance instruction in international and foreign language studies, and (2) promote international business skills and education.\n\nFirst, the bill reauthorizes programs related to international and foreign language studies. Specifically, it extends (1) the Graduate and Undergraduate Language and Area Centers and Programs, which include the National Resource Centers program; (2) the Language Resource Centers; (3) the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs; and (4) the American Overseas Research Centers.\n\nNext, the bill revises the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships program to permit graduate students to receive a stipend for the beginning, intermediate, or advanced study of a foreign language related to the student's area of specialization.\n\nFurther, the bill replaces the existing Technological Innovation and Cooperation for Foreign Information Access program with an international research and innovation program.\n\nAdditionally, the bill reauthorizes programs related to international business skills and education. Specifically, it reauthorizes the Centers for International Business Education program. It also reauthorizes the Education and Training program and otherwise makes changes to the program, including by (1) renaming the program; and (2) mandating certain program activities, such as\u00a0the incorporation of\u00a0specified programs and studies into professional education and technical training curricula.\n\nFinally, the bill permits the Department of Education to prioritize grant applications from minority-serving institutions."
