This bill requires owners of certain federally assisted housing constructed prior to 1978 to screen for and remove lead-based paint hazards in housing where families with a child under the age of six are living.

Specifically, an owner of such housing must, with some exceptions, conduct an initial risk assessment that consists of not just a visual inspection for lead-based paint hazards in housing where such a family will reside. If the assessment identifies any lead-based paint hazards, the owner must address the hazards within 30 days of the assessment and notify all residents in the affected housing.

If the owner fails to address the hazards within 30 days, the family in the affected dwelling unit may relocate on an emergency basis without (1) being placed on any waiting list, (2) paying any penalty, or (3) experiencing any lapse in assistance.

Further, the Department of Housing and Urban Development must establish a demonstration program to pay for the costs to address lead-based paint hazards in dwellings that receive certain federal rental assistance and in which the tenant is a family with a child under the age of six.</summary>
