    "text": "Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2019\n\nThis bill reauthorizes the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program until May 1, 2025. The CFATS program requires chemical facilities to assess and address their threat vulnerabilities.\n\nThe bill requires DHS to (1) verify information submitted by a covered chemical facility prior to assigning such facility a lower risk tier or determining that it no longer presents a high level of security risk, and (2) develop a voluntary program for chemical facilities to address potential security risks.\n\nDHS shall, among other things (1) provide for an annual review of a facility's compliance with its emergency response plan; (2) make necessary information available to state, local, and regional fusion centers and state and local government officials to ensure that emergency response providers are prepared; (3) establish a Chemical Security Advisory Committee to advise DHS on the implementation of this bill; and (4) study how to improve training and support for local emergency response providers in areas with high concentrations of covered facilities in how to respond to a terrorist attack on a chemical facility.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency shall (1) conduct a review of potential effects of attacks on covered chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure, and (2) establish a secure communications and information technology infrastructure or platform that allows facility owners and operators to voluntarily report on emerging threats.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall evaluate the effectiveness of DHS risk-based performance standards."
