    "text": "Deceptive Experiences To Online Users Reduction Act or the DETOUR Act This bill prohibits large online operators from manipulating their products to mislead consumers into providing personal information or giving consent. The bill further prohibits these operators from (1) studying the behavioral patterns of subsets of users without first obtaining informed consent, (2) designing online products that lead to compulsive usage, or (3) designing products directed to children that lead to an increase in the use of products through which users interact with other users without parental consent. The bill also requires large online operators conducting psychological or behavioral research to disclose certain information, discontinue such research if consent was improperly acquired, and establish an independent review board."
