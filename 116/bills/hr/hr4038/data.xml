This bill modifies the requirements for calculating taxable income to exclude post-graduation scholarship grants from gross income in the same manner as scholarships are currently excluded. A "post-graduation scholarship grant" is a grant provided by a program that is established by certain tax-exempt organizations, is designed to encourage individuals to serve in occupations of unmet needs or in areas of unmet need, and that repays any portion of an education loan incurred by an individual.</summary>
