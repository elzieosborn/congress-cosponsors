This bill generally prohibits a school or educational agency from receiving certain federal funds unless it provides a certification to the Department of Education (ED) related to resuming in-person instruction.

Specifically, the bill prohibits an elementary or secondary school, institution of higher education, or local or state educational agency from receiving federal funds for the 2020-2021 school year unless the school or educational agency certifies to ED that it (1) will begin providing in-person instruction by September 8, 2020; and (2) has a detailed plan to protect the health of students and staff. However, ED may waive this requirement.

Further, neither a school or educational agency that provides such a certification nor its employees may be held liable for in-person instruction that results in an alleged exposure to the coronavirus (i.e., the virus that causes COVID-19 or another coronavirus with pandemic potential).</summary>
