This bill reaffirms the availability of discrimination claims under specified civil rights statutes based on disparate impact.

Specifically, the bill restores and expands protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

The bill, among other things

 prohibits actions which have a discriminatory effect, regardless of any discriminatory intent; prohibits the use of compelled arbitration clauses; eliminates qualified immunity for government employees and prohibits racial and gender profiling in police investigations; awards victims of disparate impact discrimination compensation and attorney's fees; and defines sex for purposes of civil rights to include sexual orientation, pregnancy, gender identity, sex stereotypes, or any sex-related traits.</summary>
