This bill requires states to conduct federal elections held in 2020 through the use of mail-in absentee ballots. States are prohibited from operating any polling place during this time, except for elections that occur within 30 days of the bill's enactment (e.g., certain primary elections).

Specifically, states must (1) transmit absentee ballots to each registered voter at least three weeks before the date of the election; (2) provide self-sealing return envelopes with prepaid postage for absentee ballots; (3) allow voters to cure certain signature discrepancies; and (4) permit certain individuals, such as voters with disabilities, to receive assistance to complete and submit their ballot. States are prohibited from imposing any additional requirements on the ability of an individual to vote by absentee ballot.

Further, the Election Assistance Commission must make payments to states to implement the provisions of the bill. States must pass through a portion of the payments to local jurisdictions and tribal governments.</summary>
