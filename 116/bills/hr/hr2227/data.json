Under current law, only the servicemember's spouse may do so.\n\nCurrent law also allows the spouse of such a servicemember to terminate such a lease during the one-year period after the servicemember incurs a catastrophic illness or injury. The bill specifies that this authority applies only if the servicemember lacks the mental capacity to manage his or her own affairs; otherwise, the servicemember, but not the spouse, may terminate the lease during the one-year period."
