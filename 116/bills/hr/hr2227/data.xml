  <summary date="2020-03-02T23:38:27Z" status="Passed House">Gold Star Spouses and Spouses of Injured Servicemembers Leasing Relief Expansion Act of 2019

This bill revises the authority of certain family members of a servicemember who dies or&#160;becomes catastrophically ill or injured while in military service&#160;to terminate a property lease or motor vehicle lease executed by the servicemember.

Specifically, the bill allows a dependent of such a servicemember to terminate such a lease during the one-year period following the servicemember's death. Under current law, only the servicemember's spouse may do so.

Current law also allows the spouse of such a servicemember to terminate such a lease during the one-year period after the servicemember incurs a catastrophic illness or injury. The bill specifies that this authority applies only if the servicemember lacks the mental capacity to manage his or her own affairs; otherwise, the servicemember, but not the spouse, may terminate the lease during the one-year period.</summary>
