This bill direct the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a task force on supplemental foods delivery in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

The task force must study measures to streamline the redemption of supplemental foods benefits that promote convenience, safety, and equitable access to supplemental foods for participants in WIC, including online and telephonic purchasing of supplemental foods.

The task force must submit to USDA a report that includes the results of the study and recommendations with respect to such results.

USDA must submit to Congress a report that includes a plan to carry out the recommendations of the task force and an assessment of whether legislative changes are necessary to carry out such plan.

The task force shall terminate on the date USDA submits the report to Congress.</summary>
