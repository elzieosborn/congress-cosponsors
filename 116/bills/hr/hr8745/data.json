    "text": "Innovation Centers Acceleration Act\n\nThis bill provides a program to advance economic development by designating nine cities as innovation centers\u2014increasing funding for research and development\u2014and providing and modifying certain related grants. It also establishes the Innovation Center Selection Committee to designate these cities.\n\nThe innovation center designation entitles participating cities\u2014and the businesses, research institutions, and other organizations that operate within them\u2014to various federal funding and benefits for research activities, business and workforce development, and transportation infrastructure projects.\n\nThese benefits include expanding various tax credits and incentives for businesses. The bill also makes it easier for those businesses to access loans and other financial instruments to raise capital.\n\nIn addition, the bill establishes a grant program for local and tribal governments that partner with innovation centers to develop and preserve affordable housing. It also modifies existing grants, loans, and other programs that support transportation infrastructure to specifically target initiatives in innovation centers."
