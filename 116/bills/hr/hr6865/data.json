During the period beginning on February 1, 2020, and ending January 31, 2021, the bill allows for virtual home visits; prohibits reductions in funding for, or staffing of, entities that implement the home visits due to reduced enrollment of families in the program; and expands the permitted uses of program funds to include, among others, providing families with resources to support their participation in virtual visits.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to delay deadlines for requirements of the home visiting programs."
