    "text": "Stop Mail-In Voter Fraud Act\n\nThis bill provides for enhanced penalties for certain crimes related to federal elections and contains other related provisions.\n\nMore specifically, the bill increases the maximum terms of imprisonment for various criminal acts if the act involves multiple ballots related to a federal election. For example, current law allows for a prison term of up to 20 years for certain fraudulent schemes involving the mail. Under this bill, the maximum prison term shall be 30 years if such a mail fraud scheme involves multiple ballots for a federal election.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to establish a system, including a toll-free hotline and confidential website, for an individual to report instances of fraudulent transmission of ballots by mail in a federal election.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires courts to notify state election offices and DOJ when an individual has been recused from serving on a jury on the grounds that the individual is not a U.S. citizen. Each state's election office shall, as part of regular maintenance of its list of eligible voters, remove the name of such an individual from the voter list."
