  <summary date="2021-02-11T16:51:31Z" status="Introduced in House">Restoring Students' Right to Appeal Act of 2020

This bill permits individuals who filed a complaint between March 5-November 18, 2018, with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Education and who received an investigative determination of insufficient evidence, to file an appeal with the OCR. (In March 2018, the OCR revised its procedures for investigating and resolving civil rights complaints. One revision included removing the process for appealing insufficient evidence determinations. The OCR reversed this decision in its November 2018 update.)

Further, the bill requires the OCR to conduct outreach to inform individuals of their right to appeal.</summary>
