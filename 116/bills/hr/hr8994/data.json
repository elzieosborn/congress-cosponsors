(In March 2018, the OCR revised its procedures for investigating and resolving civil rights complaints. One revision included removing the process for appealing insufficient evidence determinations. The OCR reversed this decision in its November 2018 update.)\n\nFurther, the bill requires the OCR to conduct outreach to inform individuals of their right to appeal."
