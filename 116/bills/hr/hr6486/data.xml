This bill establishes a special health plan enrollment period and requires health plans to cover certain services during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. The special enrollment period applies to plans offered through health insurance exchanges and is available to eligible individuals for eight weeks beginning one week after this bill is enacted. The bill also funds outreach activities for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to notify individuals about the special enrollment period. Additionally, the bill requires private health insurance plans to cover, without any cost-sharing requirement, medically necessary services for individuals who have been diagnosed with, or are presumed to have, COVID-19. HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury must jointly issue guidance that specifies applicable medically necessary services not later than one week after this bill is enacted. Further, HHS must reimburse health plans for the amount of such cost-sharing requirements that are not imposed.</summary>
