This bill allows a defendant who has served at least 10 years in prison to petition a federal court for a sentence reduction.

Specifically, a court may reduce the prison term for a defendant if (1) the imposed prison term was more than 10 years; (2) the defendant has served at least 10 years in custody; and (3) the court finds that the defendant is not a danger to public safety, is ready for reentry, and the interests of justice warrant a sentence modification. The bill outlines the factors a court may consider in reducing a prison term.

Further, the bill creates a rebuttable presumption of sentence reduction for a defendant who is 50 years of age or older on the date of the petition.</summary>
