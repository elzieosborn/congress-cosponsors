  <summary date="2022-03-08T20:13:15Z" status="Introduced in House">Climate Change and Hurricane Correlation and Strategy Act

This bill addresses climate change and hurricanes, including by banning the use of strategic weapons for altering the weather.

Specifically, the bill prohibits federal officials from deploying strategic weapons, such as nuclear bombs, to alter weather patterns or address climate change.

In addition, the President must report annually for five years on plans to combat increasing hurricane activity due to warming oceans from climate change. The first report must include a scientific explanation and analysis on the use of nuclear bombs to alter severe weather, such as hurricanes.</summary>
