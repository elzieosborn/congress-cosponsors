This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a series of activities relating to sexual assault evidence and treatment. Among other things, HHS must establish a task force to improve forensic evidence collection related to sexual assault, maintain a website with resources and best practices related to the treatment of individuals for sexual assault, and host an annual meeting to address gaps in health care relating to sexual assault.

In addition, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services must require Medicare-participating hospitals, in their&#160;community call plans relating to on-call coverage, to specifically delineate&#160;coverage responsibilities with respect to screening and treatment related to sexual assault.</summary>
