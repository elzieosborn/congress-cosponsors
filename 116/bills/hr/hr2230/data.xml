This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue paying educational assistance or subsistence allowances during periods between school terms in certain circumstances. Specifically, the bill authorizes the payment of educational assistance or subsistence allowances during periods between school terms where the educational institution certifies the enrollment of the eligible veteran or eligible person if (1) the period between those terms does not exceed eight weeks, and (2) the terms preceding and immediately following such a break period are not shorter in length than the period itself.

The bill also specifies that such payments of educational assistance allowances shall not (1) be charged against an individual's entitlement to educational assistance, or (2) be counted toward certain limitations that are placed on the period of assistance that is allowed under two or more programs.</summary>
