This bill requires the Department of Commerce to study and report on the impact of manufacturing on U.S. businesses conducting interstate commerce.

Such study shall involve, among other things, (1) outreach to manufacturers to review internet-connected devices and solutions used in the manufacturing industry and their impact on the manufacturing process, (2) establishing a list of federal agencies asserting jurisdiction over industry sectors that rely on manufacturing and internet-connected devices and solutions used in manufacturing, and (3) surveying the marketplace and supply chain of internet-connected devices used in manufacturing to assess and identify risks and trends in such marketplace and supply chain.

Commerce must report to Congress the results of such study and any recommendations to promote the use of internet-connected devices and solutions in manufacturing.</summary>
