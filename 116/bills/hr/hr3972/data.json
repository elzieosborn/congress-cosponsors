A major rule is a rule that results in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.\n\n In addition, the bill establishes a\u00a0congressional disapproval\u00a0process for a nonmajor rule. A nonmajor rule may only take effect if Congress does not disapprove of the rule."
