This bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to designate public institutions of higher education as National Centers of Excellence in Coastal Resilience Research and Education.

NOAA shall designate as a center only a public institution of higher education that, among other things (1) has demonstrated proven expertise in the physical, engineering, and environmental sciences, particularly research and education on the impacts of sea-level rise, coastal flooding, or shoreline erosion; (2) has demonstrated a commitment to understanding the socioeconomic impacts of climate change; and (3) is in a state that frequently experiences coastal flooding or shoreline erosion in connection with sea-level rise, severe coastal storms, or seawater intrusion into groundwater supplies.

NOAA must review reports from the centers to ensure that their recommendations and guidance regarding sea-level rise, coastal flooding, shoreline erosion, and related issues are communicated to relevant federal agencies.

In carrying out this bill, NOAA may use (1) the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, (2) the Coastlines and People initiative, and (3) the National Sea Grant College Program.</summary>
