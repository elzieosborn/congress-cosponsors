This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a pilot program to facilitate the voluntary sharing of information by social networking website companies regarding threats of imminent violence posted on such websites.

Any framework established for sharing threat information shall include the consultation of civil liberty and privacy groups on a biannual basis to discuss the development of a framework protecting civil liberties and privacy, and the enforcement of policies guiding the pilot program in protecting civil liberties and privacy.

 In establishing the pilot program, DHS shall designate a federal or state, local, tribal, or territorial law enforcement agency or regional fusion center to serve as a centralized clearinghouse between social networking website companies and law enforcement.</summary>
