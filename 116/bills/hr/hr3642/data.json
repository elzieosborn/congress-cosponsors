Specifically, it revises the dispute process for consumers challenging information contained on their credit report, establishes an appeals process for disputed information, and establishes the right to injunctive relief.\n\nThe bill also requires additional disclosures from credit reporting agencies and furnishers of credit information, prohibits automatic renewals for promotional consumer credit products and services, and makes other related changes.\n\nAdditionally, the bill directs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue rules under this bill, including rules to provide for (1) accuracy and completeness in credit reports; (2) access to consumer reporting information for nonnative English speakers, the visually impaired, and the hearing impaired; and (3) the registration of consumer reporting agencies."
