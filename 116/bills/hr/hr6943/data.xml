This bill requires the Department of Commerce to study and report on the impact of unmanned delivery services on U.S. businesses conducting interstate commerce.

Such study shall involve, among other things, (1) listing industry sectors that develop and use unmanned delivery services, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots; (2) establishing a list of federal agencies asserting jurisdiction over such industry sectors; and (3) assessing risks and trends in the marketplace and supply chain of unmanned delivery services.

Commerce must report to Congress the results of such study and any recommendations to promote the adoption of unmanned delivery services.</summary>
