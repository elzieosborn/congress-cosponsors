The park's boundary shall be established by the Department of the Interior, but must not exceed the boundary of the approximately 300-acre Pullman Historic District in Chicago.\n\nUpon conveyance by Illinois to Interior, the park shall include\n\n the Pullman Factory Complex, including the Clock Tower Building and rear erecting shops; and the approximately 13 acres of land on which those structures are located. Interior must complete a general management plan for the park."
