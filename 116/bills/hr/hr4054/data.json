The bill applies political advertising disclosure requirements currently applicable to candidates (also known as stand by your ad requirements) to entities such as corporations and nonprofit organizations. Political advertisements made by these organizations must generally disclose the top funders of the entity, with specified exceptions.\n\nThe bill revises the classification of certain media, including audio and visual media, for purposes of disclaimer requirements. The bill also expands the definition of public communication to include digital communication, creates additional disclaimer readability requirements, and expands disclosure requirements for public communications consisting of campaign-related disbursements."
