  <summary date="2021-05-10T21:07:01Z" status="Public Law">This bill addresses health information technology provisions concerning cybersecurity practices and information blocking.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may reduce fines and penalties for violations of certain federal privacy standards for health information if an entity subject to those standards has adopted particular cybersecurity practices.

This bill also authorizes HHS's Office of the Inspector General to obtain information, assistance, and other support from federal agencies when investigating claims of information blocking by developers of, or entities offering, health information technologies.

Information blocking refers to a practice that is likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of electronic health information, such as the imposition of fees that make exchanging this information cost prohibitive.</summary>
