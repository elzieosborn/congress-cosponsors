    "text": "Safe Considerations of the Health Of Our Learning Students Act or SCHOOLS Act\n\nThis bill requires a study on safety precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) in schools. It also establishes a grant program to assist state educational agencies with implementing health and safety measures in schools.\n\nSpecifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must study and report on the safety precautions necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in schools. The study must address (1) the minimum criteria that a community needs to meet to reopen schools for full-time in-person instruction; and (2) the best practices for such criteria, including with respect to public health capacity to conduct testing and contact tracing in the community.\n\nAdditionally, the study must address the practices for crisis response personnel in schools, including the designation of at least one staff member to provide crisis response in each school. Further, the study must recommend practices related to staffing, facility conditions, transportation, and the organization of classes and other group settings.\n\nFinally, the Department of Education must award grants for state educational agencies to (1) implement guidance from the CDC related to health and safety measures; and (2) carry out certain activities, such as purchasing sanitation supplies. To receive a grant, a state educational agency must, among other things, offer remote digital learning options to students for the 2020-2021 school year. These grants may not be used to support private schools or for vouchers."
