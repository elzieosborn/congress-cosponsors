  <summary date="2021-02-04T00:19:14Z" status="Introduced in House">Data to Save Moms Act of 2020

This bill establishes the Task Force on Maternal Health Data and Quality Measures, and certain grants for maternal mortality review committees, to address maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among women in minority populations.

Among other activities, the task force must evaluate issues related to maternal health data and provide recommendations to improve maternity care.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may award grants to certain entities that coordinate maternal mortality review committees for purposes of including community representatives on such committees. Additionally, to the extent practicable, the committees must (1) consult with community-based organizations about nonclinical factors that contribute to adverse maternal health outcomes, and (2) review certain cases of severe maternal morbidity in addition to pregnancy-associated and pregnancy-related deaths.

In addition, the Indian Health Service and HHS must coordinate studies of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among women in tribal and minority populations, respectively.</summary>
