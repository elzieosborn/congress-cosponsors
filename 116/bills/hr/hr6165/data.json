Additionally, to the extent practicable, the committees must (1) consult with community-based organizations about nonclinical factors that contribute to adverse maternal health outcomes, and (2) review certain cases of severe maternal morbidity in addition to pregnancy-associated and pregnancy-related deaths.\n\nIn addition, the Indian Health Service and HHS must coordinate studies of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among women in tribal and minority populations, respectively."
