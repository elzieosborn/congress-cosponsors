 are consistent with the management of a specified river segment of the main Salmon River pursuant to the Central Idaho Wilderness Act of 1980, and would reduce the impact of commercial recreation facilities or services on wilderness or wild and scenic river resources and values. USDA may also consider other facilities and equipment, including hydroelectric generators, water pumps for fire suppression, and solar energy systems.</summary>
