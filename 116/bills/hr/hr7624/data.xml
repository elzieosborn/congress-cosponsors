  <summary date="2021-09-15T16:50:34Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes using certain grants to provide training to law enforcement recruits who agree to serve in their communities.

Specifically, the Department of Justice (DOJ) may provide such a grant for a local law enforcement agency to provide training for a recruit who agrees to serve as a full-time law enforcement officer (1) for at least four of the eight years after completing the training, and (2) at a local law enforcement agency within a certain distance of the place where the recruit has resided for at least five years.

The recruit must repay the costs of the training to the local law enforcement agency if the recruit does not meet these conditions. DOJ shall establish categories of extenuating circumstances that may excuse a recruit from repayment.</summary>
