  <summary date="2021-01-13T13:27:02Z" status="Introduced in House">Family Asthma Act

This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collaborate with state and local health departments to (1) conduct activities regarding asthma, including deterring the harmful consequences of uncontrolled asthma, and disseminating health education and information regarding prevention of asthma episodes and strategies for managing asthma; and (2) develop state plans incorporating public health responses to reduce the burden of asthma, particularly regarding disproportionately affected populations.

 Additionally, the bill revises and expands requirements for asthma surveillance activities and requires the CDC to coordinate data collection activities to maximize the comparability of results.

Further, the Department of Health and Human Services must submit an assessment of current activities related to asthma prevention, management, and surveillance that includes recommendations for the future direction of asthma activities.</summary>
