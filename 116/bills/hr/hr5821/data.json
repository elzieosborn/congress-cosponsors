The CMS must also (1) conduct more frequent surveys of programs that are found to be noncompliant with applicable standards; and (2) take specified enforcement actions against such programs, based on the severity of the deficiencies. Enforcement actions include civil penalties, suspended Medicare payments, and termination of program certification."
