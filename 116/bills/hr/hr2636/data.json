Commerce shall also convene a working group to develop tools for evaluating the cybersecurity of smart city or community technologies.\n\nThe Department of Labor shall establish the TechHire Workforce Training and Development Pilot Program to furnish competitive grants for technology-based job training and education programs that provide industry-recognized credentials.\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) shall implement a pilot program to improve cities' access to the expertise and infrastructure of the national laboratories to promote smart city technologies. DOE shall also expand its Technologist in Residence pilot program to include partnerships between national laboratories and cities respecting research and development related to smart cities.\n\nThe bill requires strong federal encouragement and support for private sector-led standards development activities.\n\nThe bill requires the establishment of a strategic international smart cities and communities trade program that includes trade missions to promote and assist smart-community activities, as by leveraging expertise in infrastructure development."
