  <summary date="2021-01-12T20:41:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Smart Cities and Communities Act of 2019

This bill establishes programs for the implementation and use of smart technologies and systems in communities of various sizes. A &#8220;smart city or community&#8221; is one in which innovative, advanced, and trustworthy information, communication, and energy technologies are applied to (1) improve the health and quality of life of residents; (2) increase efficiency of operations and services; (3) promote economic growth; and (4) improve safety, security, sustainability, resiliency, livability, and work life.

The Department of Commerce shall establish a regional demonstration grant program focused on facilitating adoption, and allowing measurement and validation of performance, of advanced smart city or community technologies and systems. Commerce shall also convene a working group to develop tools for evaluating the cybersecurity of smart city or community technologies.

The Department of Labor shall establish the TechHire Workforce Training and Development Pilot Program to furnish competitive grants for technology-based job training and education programs that provide industry-recognized credentials.

The Department of Energy (DOE) shall implement a pilot program to improve cities' access to the expertise and infrastructure of the national laboratories to promote smart city technologies. DOE shall also expand its Technologist in Residence pilot program to include partnerships between national laboratories and cities respecting research and development related to smart cities.

The bill requires strong federal encouragement and support for private sector-led standards development activities.

The bill requires the establishment of a strategic international smart cities and communities trade program that includes trade missions to promote and assist smart-community activities, as by leveraging expertise in infrastructure development.</summary>
