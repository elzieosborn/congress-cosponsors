This bill replaces existing federal student loan programs with the Income Dependent Education Assistance (IDEA) Loan Program and the IDEA Loan Repayment Program. Loans under these programs are not eligible for the federal public service loan forgiveness program. The repayment program offers a single repayment plan that caps annual debt repayments based on the borrower's income.

The Department of Education (ED) must provide an online tool to enable borrowers to make payments and access specified details regarding loans.

The bill provides ED with access to information in the National Directory of New Hires to identify when borrowers are hired and remind them of their repayment status and obligation to provide accurate employment information.

The bill requires (1) the total amount deducted and withheld under the IDEA Loan Repayment Program to be reported on W-2 forms, and (2) the Department of the Treasury to disclose to ED tax return information necessary to carry out the IDEA Loan Repayment Program.</summary>
