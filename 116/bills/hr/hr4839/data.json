A cottage home is a residential operation\n\n in which not more than 12 children reside; that implements a trauma-informed treatment plan for its residents; that involves family members of a child in the treatment for the child, and maintains contact with the family of the child, if available and if the involvement is clinically appropriate for the well-being of the child; that is licensed by the state where it is located; and that is accredited. The bill makes cottage homes eligible for foster care maintenance payments."
