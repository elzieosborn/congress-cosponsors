This bill makes changes to the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The bill expands the duties of the CRCL to include

 integrating civil rights and civil liberties protections into all DHS programs and activities; conducting civil rights and civil liberties impact assessments, including prior to the implementation of new DHS regulations, initiatives, programs, or policies; initiating reviews, assessments, and investigations of the administration of DHS programs and activities; leading the equal employment opportunity programs of DHS; engaging with individuals and communities whose civil rights and civil liberties may be affected by DHS programs and activities; and leading the Language Access Program to ensure that DHS can effectively communicate with individuals impacted by its programs and activities. The bill requires each operational component of DHS to designate an Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to report to the CRCL.

The Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on implementation of provisions regarding CRCL engagement with individuals and communities whose civil rights and civil liberties may be affected by DHS programs and activities.</summary>
