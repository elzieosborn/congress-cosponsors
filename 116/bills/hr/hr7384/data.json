    "text": "Safer Communities Act\n\nThis bill requires a state or local government that receives funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to maintain a system for sharing disciplinary records of law enforcement officers. It also requires the Department of Justice to award a one-time grant to states to establish a system for sharing disciplinary records.\n\nAdditionally, the bill expands death and disability benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program (PSOB) to retired public safety officers (e.g., law enforcement officers) and survivors of retired public safety officers who die while engaging in a public or private security obligation. The PSOB program provides death, disability, and education benefits to public safety officers and survivors of public safety officers who are killed or injured in the line of duty.\n\nFinally, the bill directs the Government Accountability Office to study and report on settlement or collaborative agreements entered into pursuant to litigation arising out of allegations of police misconduct."
