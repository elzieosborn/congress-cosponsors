A clinical pathway is a health care management tool designed around research and evidence-backed practices that provides direction for the clinical care and treatment of a specific episode of a condition or ailment.\n\nThe VA must publish the proposed clinical pathway in the Federal Register for public comment. Additionally, the bill requires the VA to publish the established clinical pathway on a public VA website and to update the clinical pathway at least annually.\n\nUnder the bill, the VA must submit (1) a plan to establish a comprehensive prostate cancer program, and (2) a plan that provides for continual funding for supporting prostate cancer research through the VA Office of Research and Development. The VA must also establish a program evaluation tool to learn best practices of multidisciplinary disease-based implementation.\n\nFinally, the VA must establish a real-time, actionable, national prostate cancer registry that is accessible to clinicians and researchers."
