This bill expands eligibility for the universal service support mechanisms through which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) assists broadband service providers with making essential communications technology available for all consumers.

Under current law, a broadband service provider must be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier to receive universal service support.

The bill makes a broadband service provider that is not so designated eligible to receive universal service support if the provider meets certain legal, financial, and technical requirements.

Further, the bill requires the FCC to designate broadband service as supported by federal universal service support mechanisms.</summary>
