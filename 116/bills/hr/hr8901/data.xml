This bill requires state homes that receive funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to have a governing body that is legally responsible for establishing and implementing policies regarding the management and operation of the home. A&#160;state&#160;home&#160;is a&#160;home&#160;established by a&#160;state&#160;for&#160;veterans disabled by age, disease, or otherwise and who are incapable of earning a living because of such disability. The term also includes a&#160;home&#160;that furnishes nursing&#160;home&#160;care for&#160;veterans.

Additionally, the bill requires the VA to assist state homes in the hiring and retention of infection preventionists.</summary>
