Specifically, the bureau must award compensation to whistleblowers for 10%-30% of the collected monetary sanctions. In cases where the bureau is unable to collect at least $1 million of the imposed sanctions, the bureau must award any single whistleblower 10% of the amount collected or $50,000, whichever is greater. The bill also sets forth requirements regarding the legal representation of a whistleblower and provides for confidentiality regarding the whistleblower's identity."
