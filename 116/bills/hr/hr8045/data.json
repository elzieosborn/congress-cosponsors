Upon completion of the assessment, DHS shall make a determination if any changes to future DHS operations are required to address security vulnerabilities identified in such assessment.\n\nDHS shall report to the congressional homeland security committees on the findings of such threat assessment, recommendations, plans for incorporating such recommendations into future DHS operations, and proposed legislative changes."
