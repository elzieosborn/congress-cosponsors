Interior must also establish a program that awards scholarships to students enrolled in an accredited school or college of veterinary medicine. In exchange for the loan payment or scholarship, students must agree to serve for at least four consecutive years at a wildlife or veterinary institution as a wildlife or zoological veterinarian.\n\nIn addition, Interior must also (1) establish a pilot program to award grants to accredited schools and colleges of veterinary medicine to develop or improve new or existing curricula that specialize in wildlife or zoological veterinary medicine, and (2) award grants to eligible wildlife or veterinary institutions to establish or expand training programs that will enhance the ability of a trainee to practice as a wildlife or zoological veterinarian."
