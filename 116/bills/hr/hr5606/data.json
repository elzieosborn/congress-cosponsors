Mitigation payments shall be provided by the Air Force to Interior for such support on lands withdrawn and reserved for use by the Air Force within the refuge.\n\nInterior and the Air Force must jointly establish (1) an interagency committee to facilitate coordination and minimize potential conflict regarding joint operating areas within the refuge, and (2) an intergovernmental executive committee for the management of the natural and cultural resources of the withdrawn and reserved lands of the ranges and certain other ranges.\n\nInterior shall facilitate public access to portions of the joint use area of the refuge for tribal, recreational, educational, and research purposes.\n\nThe bill sets the western boundary of refuge between the refuge and the land jointly managed by the Air Force and Interior concerning Nellis Air Force Range."
