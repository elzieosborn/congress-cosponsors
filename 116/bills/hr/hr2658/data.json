The exemption applies to H-2B visas issued to nonimmigrant aliens for employment (1) on a commercial fishing vessel or shrimp trawler; or (2) in the processing of fish, baitfish, or fishery products. (An H-2B visa is for an alien entering the United States to perform nonagricultural temporary labor, where the alien has no intention of abandoning the alien's residence in a foreign country.)"
