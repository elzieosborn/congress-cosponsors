This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to collect data on the&#160;food and housing insecurity of college students.

Specifically, ED must add questions that measure rates of food and housing insecurity to the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. In addition, ED must collect&#160;data on student eligibility under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program).

ED must also provide students with contact information for the state agency that administers SNAP in their state.</summary>
