This bill allows certain businesses and tax-exempt entities that conduct live events for which tickets are sold to the general public a tax credit for 50% of any refund made during the period beginning on January 31, 2020, and ending on the enactment date of this bill. The bill defines live event as any live concert, comedy show, sporting event, or theatrical production for which tickets were made available to the general public not less than six weeks prior to the event. The credit does not apply to an entity engaged in professional football, basketball, baseball, or other professional sport.

The ticket refund paid by the entity to a ticket purchaser for a live event includes events cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 (i.e., the coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic</summary>
