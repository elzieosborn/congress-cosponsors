  <summary date="2020-06-17T13:34:01Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the United States to withhold all contributions to the World Health Organization (WHO) until (1) China's WHO membership is terminated, and (2) Taiwan is granted full membership. (China considers Taiwan a part of China, and, as a result, the WHO does not consider Taiwan a member state.)

The President shall direct the U.S. representative to the WHO to encourage other member states to take similar action.</summary>
