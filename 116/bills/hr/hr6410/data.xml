  <summary date="2020-04-16T17:21:39Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the President to use existing authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure the supply of ventilators, N-95 respirator masks, and other personal protective equipment to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). (That act confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in order to provide essential materials and goods needed for the national defense.)

The President must (1) make a determination that the ventilators and protective equipment are essential for the national defense; (2) identify private-sector capacity to&#160;produce such equipment; and (3) exercise authorities under the act to&#160;mitigate, where possible, the dependency of the United States on overseas sources and to&#160;ensure the supply of such equipment.

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the agency coordinating the response shall submit weekly reports to Congress on the status and distribution of such equipment.</summary>
