The Office of Science and Technology Policy must develop a strategy for coordinated observation of space weather by working group agencies.\n\nThe advisory group shall receive advice from specified stakeholders, including the commercial space weather sector, to inform the interests and work of the working group.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shall work with federal and international partners to secure reliable back-up capability for near real-time coronal mass ejection imagery and other relevant observations required for space weather forecasts.\n\nThe National Science Foundation, NOAA, and NASA shall each pursue multidisciplinary research in subjects that further the understanding of solar physics, space physics, and space weather.\n\nThe roundtable shall facilitate communication and knowledge transfer among government participants in the working group, the academic community, and the commercial space weather sector.\n\nThe working group shall periodically review and update the benchmarks identified as Space Weather Phase I Benchmarks."
