  <summary date="2019-07-31T15:47:47Z" status="Introduced in House">Residential Recovery Zone Act

This bill allows a new tax credit for the purchase of a principal residence in a residential recovery zone. The credit is equal to 10% of the purchase price of the residence, which may not exceed $1.5 million. The dollar amount of the credit is limited to $8,000 in a taxable year.

The bill allows the chief executive officer (e.g., governor) of a state to designate certain population census tracts in areas related to federally declared disasters as opportunity zones. This makes investments in the areas eligible for various tax incentives.</summary>
