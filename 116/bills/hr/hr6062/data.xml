  <summary date="2021-01-28T15:02:54Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands existing requirements relating to supply shortages of life-saving drugs to also apply to life-saving medical devices.

Generally, a manufacturer must (1) notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of supply interruptions in certain circumstances, (2) provide for the expedited review of a new device that may mitigate the shortage, and (3) allow the FDA to authorize the importation of the device for emergency medical care.</summary>
