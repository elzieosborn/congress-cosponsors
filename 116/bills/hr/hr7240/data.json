Current law requires compliance with older versions of these standards.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Agriculture may establish additional or different energy efficiency requirements if they are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable standards.\n\nAdditionally, new construction of manufactured housing must comply with standards issued by certain industry bodies or by the Department of Energy."
