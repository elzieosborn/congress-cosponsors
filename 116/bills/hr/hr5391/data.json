    "text": "Wood Heaters Emissions Reduction Act of 2019 or the WHERA Act\n\nThis bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement programs and authorize policy to reduce emissions from wood heaters.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the EPA to establish a grant program to provide funding for programs designed to (1) incentivize homeowners to replace old wood heaters with more efficient, cleaner-burning heaters; (2) achieve significant reductions in emissions from wood heaters; (3) help homeowners transition to safer and more efficient heating sources; and (4) support retailers, installers, and manufacturers that sell and make more efficient certified clean heaters.\n\nThe EPA must also establish a program to (1) inform stakeholders of the benefits of replacing wood heaters that do not meet specified emission reductions standards, (2) develop nonfinancial incentives to promote the proper installation and use of certified clean heaters, and (3) consult with Indian tribes to implement programs and actions to reduce wood heater emissions.\n\nFinally, the bill authorizes the EPA to accept wood heater emissions reductions Supplemental Environmental Projects."
