This bill establishes that certain payments for coordinated expenditures are campaign contributions for purposes of disclosure and reporting requirements. The bill (1) generally defines a coordinated expenditure as a payment made by any person in cooperation with a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, a political committee of a political party, or agent of a candidate or committee; and (2) sets forth penalties for willfully violating limits related to making contributions to a candidate for coordinated expenditures.

The bill also prohibits a candidate or federal office holder from soliciting, receiving, directing, or transferring funds to or on behalf of certain types of political committees.</summary>
