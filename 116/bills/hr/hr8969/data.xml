This bill increases the low-income housing tax credit for buildings in transit-oriented development areas. The bill defines a transit-oriented development area as a designated area located within 1/4 mile from a rail, bus, harbor, or waterway station and zoned for high density.

The bill also directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to study cost-of-living differences based on geographic location and proximity and accessibility to transit.</summary>
