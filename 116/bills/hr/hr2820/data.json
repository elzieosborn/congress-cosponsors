The bill imposes various qualifying requirements, such as the alien being continuously physically present in the United States since four years before this bill's enactment, passing a background check, and being enrolled in or having completed certain educational programs.\n\nDHS shall remove the conditions placed on permanent resident status granted under this bill if the alien applies and meets certain requirements, such as completing certain programs at an educational institution, serving in the military, or being employed.\n\nAn alien shall have the right to administrative and judicial review of the denial or revocation of an immigration status granted under this bill. Furthermore, an alien shall be appointed counsel upon request when seeking judicial review of a provisional denial of an application for permanent resident status under this bill.\n\nDHS may not use information from applications filed under this bill or for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status for immigration enforcement purposes.\n\nDHS shall establish a grant program for nonprofit organizations that assist individuals with certain immigration-related issues."
