  <summary date="2021-02-09T18:32:08Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development to award grants to owners of grand-family housing (i.e., housing dedicated to low-income grandparents or older relative caregivers who are caring full-time for a related child) for housing programming services, equipment, and upkeep and construction of buildings. Additionally, grant recipients must engage with grandparent and older caregivers in the community by performing periodic informational outreach and holding periodic events.</summary>
