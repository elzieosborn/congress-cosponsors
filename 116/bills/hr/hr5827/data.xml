This bill revises certain requirements related to the REAL ID Act of 2005 (required enhanced driver's licenses for domestic flights) for purposes of boarding a federally regulated commercial aircraft.

Specifically, the bill

 exempts individuals with a known traveler number (assigned to an individual and accepted as validating that the individual holding such identifier is a member of a known low-risk population) from REAL ID requirements; requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to accept enrollment in PreCheck as an allowable alternative to presenting a REAL ID compliant credential to board a commercial aircraft until April 1, 2022; directs the TSA to develop, socialize, and implement alternative checkpoint screening procedures for individuals arriving at a checkpoint without a form of acceptable identification; provides an opportunity for airports to request the TSA to conduct REAL ID implementation exercises; and allows states to establish a process for the submission of electronic documents and electronic facial images when individuals are applying for a REAL ID compliant identification.</summary>
