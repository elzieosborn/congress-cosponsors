SSI is a federal income supplement program designed to help aged, blind, and disabled individuals with limited income and resources meet basic needs.\n\nUnder the bill, states may not use asset or resource limits to determine eligibility for (1) programs funded by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families grants, (2) the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or (3) the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n\nIn addition, an individual may have up to $10,000 in certain resources (or up to $20,000 for a couple) and qualify for SSI. Under current law, the limit is $2,000 for an individual (or $3,000 for a couple)."
