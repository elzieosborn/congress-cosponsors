This bill expands eligibility for the Department of Veterans Affairs Specially Adapted Housing grant, which assists veterans with certain service-connected disabilities with acquiring housing with special features. Currently, a disabled veteran must have blindness in both eyes and loss (or loss of use) of one lower extremity to be eligible. The bill revises this requirement to expand eligibility to veterans who have not lost a lower extremity but are disabled due to blindness in both eyes, having central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a standard correcting lens.</summary>
