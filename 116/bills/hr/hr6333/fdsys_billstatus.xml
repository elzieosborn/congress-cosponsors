        <text><![CDATA[ <p>This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to establish a Small Business Financial Assistance Program to provide loans and loan guarantees to small businesses.</p> <p>Such loans shall be zero-interest loans, provided a recipient does not involuntarily terminate any employee during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency. If a recipient demonstrates that its full-time employment has not decreased after one year, the Treasury shall forgive the remaining outstanding principal and interest on such loan or loan guarantee. Further, the Treasury may, upon request, provide applicants with a cash advance on such loans. </p>]]></text>
