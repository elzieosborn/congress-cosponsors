The bill also imposes record-keeping requirements on such entities with respect to the enforcement of occupational safety and health protections.\n\nAdditionally, these entities may not (1) retaliate against an employee for requesting OCWR action or for participating in an OCWR investigation, (2) fire an employee because the employee's wages have been garnished due to a debt, (3) retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activities, (4) discriminate against an employee for being a debtor or bankrupt, or (5) retaliate against an employee for attending jury service."
