If the U.S. citizen has been discharged from the Armed Forces, such discharge must be under honorable conditions.\n\nCertain factors that would otherwise make an alien inadmissible, such as having entered the United States without being admitted, shall not make such an alien parent ineligible for permanent residence status under this bill. The Department of Homeland Security may also waive certain factors that would otherwise make an alien inadmissible, such as having misrepresented a material fact to secure a visa, if the alien does not pose a threat to the public and has not committed any crimes that are unrelated to immigration status."
