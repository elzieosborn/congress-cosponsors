In addition, the bill provides statutory authority for existing programs, including the CDC's Children's Preparedness Unit and the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. The bill also establishes new programs and entities, including a trauma-center grant program to support military trauma teams.\n\nThe bill further modifies the approval process for OTC drugs by providing statutory authority for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to (1) regulate certain OTC drugs that are marketed without an approved new-drug application, and (2) issue administrative orders specifying the conditions under which an OTC drug may be deemed safe and effective and not subject to approval as a new drug. The FDA must assess and collect user fees for OTC drugs, including OTC-drug facility and OTC-drug order-request fees."
