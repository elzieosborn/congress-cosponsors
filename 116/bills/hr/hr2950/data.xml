This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that its publicly accessible website on federal awards includes information indicating whether an award has resulted in the existence of one or more active financial conflicts of interest with respect to the President, Vice President, spouse, or dependent children.

 The Bureau of the Fiscal Service of the Department of the Treasury must annually submit to Congress a report that includes a comprehensive accounting of all new or ongoing active conflicts of interest.</summary>
