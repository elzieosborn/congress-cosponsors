This bill requires the Department of Commerce to study and report on the impact of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, on U.S. businesses conducting interstate commerce.

Such study shall involve, among other things, (1) listing industry sectors that develop and use artificial intelligence and public-private partnerships focused on promoting the adoption and use of such technology, (2) establishing a list of federal agencies asserting jurisdiction over such industry sectors and entities and determining how these agencies are reducing barriers to business adoption and use of artificial intelligence, and (3) assessing risks and trends in the marketplace and supply chain of artificial intelligence.

Commerce must report to Congress the results of such study and any recommendations to promote the adoption of artificial intelligence.</summary>
