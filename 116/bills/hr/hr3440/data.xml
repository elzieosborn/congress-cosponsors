This bill reduces the pay for Members of Congress in certain circumstances, and it eliminates the automatic appropriation of funds for specified purposes.

Specifically, if Congress does not agree to a budget resolution by the beginning of a fiscal year, each Member's annual pay shall be reduced to 90% of that Member's pay in the previous fiscal year. This reduction shall apply after the November 2020 general election.

In addition, the bill eliminates the automatic appropriation of funds for Members' compensation and for certain administrative expenses.</summary>
