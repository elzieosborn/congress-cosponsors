This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a permanent tolerance for the use of glyphosate on oats not to exceed 0.1 parts per million. The labeling for pesticides containing glyphosate must include specific wording, or shall be considered misbranded and subject to enforcement procedures.

The bill also requires the Department of Agriculture to annually test foods that are most likely to be consumed by infants and children (e.g., oats) for residues of glyphosate.</summary>
