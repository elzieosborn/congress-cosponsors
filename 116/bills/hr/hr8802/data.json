    "text": "Hospitality and Commerce Job Recovery Act of 2020\n\nThis bill establishes new tax credits and revises existing credits and deductions to protect the hospitality and restaurant industries. Specifically, the bill allows a convention and trade show restart tax credit for (1) the costs of participation in a convention, seminar, or similar meeting, a business meeting, or a trade show that takes place after 2020; and (2) the costs of reopening an entertainment facility closed due to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. It also allows a business-related tax credit for the costs of reopening restaurants or food service businesses forced to close down or reduce operations due to COVID-19.\n\nThe bill modifies, and increases the rate of, the tax credit for the retention of employees for an employer whose business has been affected by a disaster or public health emergency. It also repeals the increased limitations on the tax deduction for meals and entertainment expenses enacted in 2017.\n\nFinally, the bill allows individual taxpayers a new tax credit for travel expenses relating to entertainment activities occurring in the United States between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2023."
