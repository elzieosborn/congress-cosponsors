This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student-aid programs to provide students with additional resources on registering to vote. In addition, IHEs must provide students who are off campus due to a public health emergency with resources on voting by mail (e.g., absentee ballot applications).</summary>
