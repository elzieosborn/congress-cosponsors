  <summary date="2021-03-23T14:25:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Innovation Act or the CCUS Innovation Act

This bill addresses the capture, utilization, and storage of carbon dioxide.

Among other things, the bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to (1) establish a competitive prize program for certain technology projects that capture carbon dioxide directly from the air, (2) research and develop technologies or approaches that transform carbon dioxide generated by industrial processes into a product of commercial value, and (3) support research and infrastructure activities relating to carbon dioxide utilization by providing technical and financial assistance.</summary>
