This bill reauthorizes through FY2025 and otherwise revises the Indian Energy Education Planning and Management Assistance Program. The program is administered by the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs within the Department of Energy (DOE).

Specifically, the bill revises the program to (1) expand the definition of Indian land to include any land in a census tract in which the majority of the residents are Alaska Natives or enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe or village, thereby permitting such areas to receive program grants; and (2) allow DOE to reduce the cost share required in order to receive a grant if certain criteria are met, including financial need.

The bill also requires DOE to assess the availability and reliability of electricity for those individuals residing in tribal communities or on Indian land.</summary>
