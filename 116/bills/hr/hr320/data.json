Specifically, the ACL must conduct a survey of current programs for individuals, including young adults, with neurological diseases or conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or traumatic brain injury. In addition to identifying successful programs, the ACL must also develop best practices for establishing such programs.\n\nThe ACL must also establish a grant program to fund adult day programs that serve younger people with neurological diseases or conditions."
