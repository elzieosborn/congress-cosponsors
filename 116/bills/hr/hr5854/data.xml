This bill establishes grants and a committee within the Department of Education (ED) to assist schools with discontinuing the use of derogatory or discriminatory names or depictions as team names, mascots, or nicknames.

Specifically, the bill authorizes ED to make (1) grants to elementary, secondary, and postsecondary schools to assist them in discontinuing the use of names or depictions that are derogatory or discriminatory; and (2) subsequent grants to schools to discontinue objectionable names or depictions and to Indian schools for construction or renovation.

Additionally, ED must establish a committee on Indian relations to (1) determine which names and depictions are derogatory or discriminatory, (2) identify schools that use derogatory or discriminatory names or descriptions and inform them of the availability of assistance in discontinuing their use, (3) assist ED in awarding grants, and (4) provide cultural proficiency training at grantee schools.

The bill lists Indians, Redskins, Braves, and Chiefs as derogatory or discriminatory names or depictions.</summary>
