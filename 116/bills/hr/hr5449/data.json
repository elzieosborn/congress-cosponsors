Under the program, DOT provides grants to states to demonstrate user-based alternative revenue mechanisms that utilize a user fee structure to maintain the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nSpecifically, the bill\n\n increases funding to carry out the program; authorizes DOT to provide grants for states to test solutions to ensure the privacy and security of data collected for the purpose of implementing a user-based alternative revenue mechanism; revises reporting requirements for DOT; and requires DOT to provide special consideration to projects that carry out activities not previously carried out to advance the knowledge and practice of surface transportation system funding alternatives or that collect revenues from pilot project participants."
