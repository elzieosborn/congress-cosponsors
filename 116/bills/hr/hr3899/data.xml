  <summary date="2022-06-01T17:24:41Z" status="Introduced in House">TPS Reform Act of 2019

This bill changes the procedures for designating a country with temporary protected status (TPS). (Qualified nationals of a TPS-designated country shall have work authorization and may not be removed from the United States while the status is in effect.)

Specifically, the bill requires an act of Congress to designate a country with TPS status, where currently the Department of Justice has such authority. In an initial act designating a TPS country, Congress shall include a time period for the designation of up to 18 months. Congress may also pass an act to terminate or extend a designation.

The bill also establishes that an alien who lacks a lawful immigration status shall not receive the benefits of temporary protected status.</summary>
