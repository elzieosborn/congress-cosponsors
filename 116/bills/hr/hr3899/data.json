    "text": "TPS Reform Act of 2019\n\nThis bill changes the procedures for designating a country with temporary protected status (TPS). (Qualified nationals of a TPS-designated country shall have work authorization and may not be removed from the United States while the status is in effect.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires an act of Congress to designate a country with TPS status, where currently the Department of Justice has such authority. In an initial act designating a TPS country, Congress shall include a time period for the designation of up to 18 months. Congress may also pass an act to terminate or extend a designation.\n\nThe bill also establishes that an alien who lacks a lawful immigration status shall not receive the benefits of temporary protected status."
