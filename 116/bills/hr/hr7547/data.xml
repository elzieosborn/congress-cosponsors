This bill directs the Department of the Interior to issue final regulations prohibiting the discharge of any firearm using ammunition other than non-lead ammunition on all lands and waters under the jurisdiction and control of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Interior shall establish and annually update a list of non-lead ammunition.

The prohibition shall not apply to (1) a government official or agent who is carrying out a statutory duty unrelated to the management of wildlife; (2) a state, local, tribal, or federal law enforcement officer, or the agent of such an officer, who is carrying out a statutory duty; or (3) an active member of the U.S. military who is carrying out official duties.

A person that knowingly violates the prohibition may be assessed a civil penalty by Interior of (1) no more than $500 for the first violation, and (2) no less than $1,000 or more than $5,000 for a second or subsequent violation.</summary>
