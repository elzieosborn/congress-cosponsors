  <summary date="2021-05-25T12:44:54Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides that tax payments made through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System of the Department of the Treasury that are required to be made within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date shall be treated as made on the last day of either such prescribed period or on such prescribed date. The bill thus generally applies the mailbox rule (also known as the posting rule) to such payments which provides that payments are considered made on the date they are postmarked.</summary>
