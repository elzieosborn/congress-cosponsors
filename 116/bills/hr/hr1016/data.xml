This bill requires the federal government to reimburse certain costs resulting from a government shutdown incurred by states or employees of the federal government, the District of Columbia government, or federal contractors.

Employee costs that must be reimbursed include any fees, fines, or interest resulting from an employee's inability to make payments due to a loss in salary. The bill requires that each employee be paid for any shutdown cost at the earliest date possible after a lapse in appropriations of 14 days or longer.

States must be reimbursed for payments for assistance programs that would be paid by the federal government but for a lapse in appropriations of 14 days or longer.</summary>
