This bill provides for an alternative process by which the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) may automatically enroll certain individuals who are eligible for low-income subsidies under the Medicare prescription drug benefit in prescription drug plans. Specifically, the CMS may use a process that actively matches such individuals with prescription drug plans based on the individual's needs in relation to certain factors (e.g., formularies), rather than the current random assignment process.</summary>
