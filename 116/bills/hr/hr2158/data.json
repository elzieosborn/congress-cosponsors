If approval for centralized delivery is granted, at least 60 days before commencing such delivery the local postmaster shall provide (1) written notice to any other units of local government and any planning commissions located within the applicable county; and (2) a period of 60 days for public comment from residents, property owners, and home builders within such county regarding the use of centralized delivery at the applicable housing development.\n\nThe Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure that the USPS does not change any USPS policy in effect on the date of enactment that would result in a disproportionate negative affect on rural, lower income, elderly, disabled, or predominately minority communities."
