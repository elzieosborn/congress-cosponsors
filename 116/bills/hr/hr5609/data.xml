This bill allows states to request a presidential declaration of a homelessness emergency. The bill also requires certain budgetary adjustments to discretionary accounts related to homelessness emergency assistance.

Upon a presidential declaration of a homelessness emergency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may provide homelessness emergency assistance, including housing vouchers, to states and local communities that are or will be affected by the homelessness emergency.</summary>
