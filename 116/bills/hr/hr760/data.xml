This bill authorizes federal employees who are furloughed or excepted from furlough and working without pay during a lapse in appropriations (i.e., government shutdown) to seek and obtain outside employment during such lapse without prior approval from the employing agency.

Any compensation received through such outside employment shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of backpay to which the employee is entitled.</summary>
