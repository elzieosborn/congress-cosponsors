This bill provides political advertising vouchers and postage funds to candidates for congressional office in a general election. To qualify for these vouchers and funds, candidates must (1) agree to certain contribution limits, (2) meet specified small-dollar donation thresholds, and (3) agree to other funding and expenditure limits. Vouchers may be used for the purchase of time from a broadcasting station or online platform for political advertisements. The payments to defray the costs of postage may be used by authorized committees of the candidate in connection with the election.

The bill establishes the Clean Money Fund in the Department of the Treasury for the redemption of political advertising vouchers. The bill provides for deposits into the fund.

The bill imposes civil penalties for violation of contribution and expenditure requirements.

The bill limits a broadcasting station's preemption of political advertisements. It also revises the requirements for revocation of a station license for failure to allow access by candidates.</summary>
