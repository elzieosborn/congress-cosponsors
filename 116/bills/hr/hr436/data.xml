  <summary date="2020-05-04T22:16:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Fracking Disclosure and Safety Act

This bill establishes requirements governing oil or gas operations, such as hydraulic fracturing operations. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a process to extract underground resources such as oil or gas from a geologic formation by injecting water, a propping agent (e.g., sand), and chemical additives into a well under enough pressure to fracture the geological formation.

Specifically, the bill eliminates certain exemptions for oil or gas operations from environmental requirements, including requirements concerning stormwater runoff, hazardous air pollutants, solid waste disposal, and drinking water sources. The bill also revises drinking water requirements to require hydraulic fracturing operations to disclose the chemicals they use in underground injections.

In addition, the bill requires the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to issue regulations governing the use of hydraulic fracturing under oil and gas leases for federal lands. Until the BLM issues those regulations, the bill reestablishes the requirements of the repealed rule titled &#8220;Oil and Gas; Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Land."

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must issue a rule that adds hydrogen sulfide to the list of hazardous air pollutants. The EPA must also publish a list of categories and subcategories of major sources and area sources of hydrogen sulfide, including oil and gas wells.

Finally, the bill requires the EPA to issue regulations for solid waste associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy if the EPA determines that the wastes are hazardous.</summary>
