The VA must ensure a loan for the purchase of stock or membership in a cooperative housing corporation is not denied if it has been reviewed and approved by a lender approved by Fannie Mae.\n\nThe bill also requires the VA to advertise the availability of loan guarantees for housing cooperative share loans to notify eligible veterans, participating lenders, and interested realtors of the availability of such loan guarantees and the procedures and requirements that apply to the obtaining of such guarantees."
