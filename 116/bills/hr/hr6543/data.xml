  <summary date="2020-04-28T12:00:26Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill modifies the authority to designate individuals as members of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Currently, the chairperson of the committee may designate inspectors general from agencies involved in the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) response as members of the committee. The bill transfers that authority to the Chairperson of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The bill also expands eligibility for designation as a committee member to include individuals serving in inspector general offices in positions at the Senior Executive Service level or higher.</summary>
