  <summary date="2021-11-17T15:50:45Z" status="Introduced in House">David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2019 or David's Law

This bill adds hate crime offenses and penalties to the criminal civil rights statute that prohibits interference with federally protected activities. Current law already prohibits and penalizes similar offenses under the criminal civil rights statute that prohibits hate crime offenses.

Additionally, the bill authorizes state and local grants to combat hate crimes committed by juveniles. It also authorizes the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Justice to hire additional personnel to prevent and respond to alleged criminal civil rights offenses involving interference with federally protected activities.

Finally, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to study whether it is appropriate to provide a sentencing enhancement for adult defendants who recruit minors to commit hate crime offenses.</summary>
