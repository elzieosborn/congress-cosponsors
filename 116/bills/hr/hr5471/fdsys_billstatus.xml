        <text><![CDATA[ <p>This bill states that the effective date for an award of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits for a child of a Vietnam veteran who is suffering from spina bifida is the date of the child's birth. Under current law, the effective date for the provision of such benefits is January, 1, 1997 (but not before receipt of the application for benefits). This bill thus provides benefit eligibility for children born before January 1, 1997.</p>]]></text>
