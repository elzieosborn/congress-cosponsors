    "text": "Reforming Evergreening and Manipulation that Extends Drug Years Act or the REMEDY Act \n\nThis bill addresses drug patents with respect to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a drug application.\n\nCurrently, when the owner of a brand-name drug approval sues a generic drug company for patent infringement based on the generic company's application for FDA approval of a generic version of the brand-name drug, there is generally a 30-month stay on the approval of the generic version. Under this bill, the stay goes into effect only if the lawsuit alleges infringement of a patent that claims the drug compound.\n\nWhen the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidates a patent for a drug, the FDA must update its list of relevant patents for the drug."
