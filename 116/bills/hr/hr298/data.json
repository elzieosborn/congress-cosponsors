The bill also provides for the release of such funds to the Members.\n\nBeginning in FY2022, if OMB does not certify that a chamber has adopted a balanced budget before April 16 of the prior fiscal year, each Member of that chamber shall be paid $1 annually for pay periods beginning on April 16 of the prior fiscal year and ending on the earlier of\n\n the date on which OMB certifies that the chamber has adopted a balanced budget for such fiscal year, or the last day of the calendar year in which such period begins. This bill requires legislation in either chamber that increases revenue to be agreed upon only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of that chamber."
