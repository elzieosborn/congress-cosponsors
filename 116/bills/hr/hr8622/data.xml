This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct national hazard preparation and response exercises and to report to Congress on such exercises and to report annually on the impact of natural disasters or public health emergencies on critical infrastructure.

Specifically, DHS, in coordination with the Department of Energy (DOE), must at specified intervals conduct an exercise to test the modeling, simulation, and analysis capabilities and their utility for emergency response of the United States with respect to significant natural disasters or public health emergencies impacting critical infrastructure. Each exercise shall be coordinated through the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center and the DOE National Laboratories and Technology Centers.</summary>
