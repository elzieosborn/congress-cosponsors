    "text": "Enhancing Oversight to End Discrimination in Policing Act\n\nThis bill contains provisions related to federal investigations of state and local law enforcement activities, including an authorization of additional appropriations for the Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division for FY2020-FY2029.\n\nCertain DOJ-imposed limitations on civil settlement agreements between the DOJ and a local or state entity shall have no effect. (Typically, such an agreement involves the entity agreeing to take certain actions, such as a law enforcement agency agreeing to require certain officer training or stop certain policing practices. In November 2018, DOJ announced that it would adopt certain procedures and requirements to limit such agreements, such as requiring approval by a senior DOJ official if an agreement would create long-term structural obligations for the entity.)\n\nA certain portion of the increased funding for the Civil Rights Division authorized by the bill shall be available for investigations into law enforcement agencies or related entities that engage in a pattern or practice of depriving persons of their civil rights.\n\nThe bill also authorizes a state attorney general's office to file a lawsuit under federal law against a law enforcement agency or related entity that engages in a pattern or practice of depriving persons of their civil rights, where currently only DOJ has such authority. DOJ may provide grants to state and tribal governments to investigate and pursue such cases."
