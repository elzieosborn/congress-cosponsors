Specifically, the GAO must report every two years on\n\n the use of non-driving related underwriting factors; controls and practices in use by insurers to prevent discriminatory pricing of coverage; how premiums are impacted by zip code, race, religion, and other factors; and state insurance regulatory oversight and enforcement regarding discriminatory pricing. State insurance regulatory bodies must take into consideration these reports in establishing and approving premium rates for private passenger automobile insurance coverage."
