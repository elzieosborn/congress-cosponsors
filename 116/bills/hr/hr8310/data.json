    "text": "Countering China's Theft of American Research and Innovation Act or the CCTARI Act\n\nThis bill modifies provisions related to reviewing visa applications for risks, including the illicit transfer of sensitive research from U.S. research institutions, and contains other related provisions.\n\nA previously established interagency working group to coordinate the protection of federally-funded research from foreign interference shall report to Congress on a review of current Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of State policies for preventing the illicit transfer of sensitive research from U.S. higher education and research institutions, including visa issuance procedures and national security reviews of certain nonimmigrant students.\n\nThe bill also modifies provisions authorizing DHS to assign its employees to diplomatic and consular posts to conduct visa application reviews and related tasks. When making such an assignment, DHS shall do so in a risk-based manner based on certain criteria, such as the number of nationals in a country identified as known or suspected terrorists and the number of cases involving illicit technology transfer. Such employees shall review visa applications to improve detection of cases that pose a substantial risk of illicit technology transfers.\n\nDHS shall also prioritize establishing new overseas assignments with the goal of countering the exploitation or illicit transfer of sensitive technologies by student and exchange visitor visa holders.\n\nDHS and the State Department shall jointly carry out a pilot program to evaluate the use of machine-readable technology to improve visa application and security vetting processes."
