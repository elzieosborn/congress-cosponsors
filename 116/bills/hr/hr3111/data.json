    "text": "National Flood Insurance Program Administrative Reform Act of 2019\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the appeals process for National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholders seeking review of a flood insurance claim denial by their insurer. The bill prohibits fraud and false statements in connection with a flood insurance claim under NFIP.\n\nClaims under NFIP must be approved or denied no later than 120 days after the claim is made, with provisions for an extension in extraordinary cases.\n\nThe bill gives FEMA oversight in litigation conducted by Write Your Own companies. (A Write Your Own company writes and services federal standard flood insurance policies in its own name.) FEMA may not hire in connection with NFIP any disbarred or suspended attorney.\n\nThis bill directs FEMA to ensure sufficient staff for the Flood Insurance Advocate, authorizes FEMA to credit reserve funds to the National Flood Insurance Fund, and establishes pilot programs and committees.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on claims adjustment practices under NFIP and NFIP coverage of earth movement and subsidence."
