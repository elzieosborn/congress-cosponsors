For example, with respect to a qualifying private beach that benefits from certain federal projects, the bill requires the Corps of Engineers to permit a nonfederal interest to periodically obtain a right of entry to the private beach to perform project-related activities, rather than requiring the nonfederal interest to obtain a permanent easement."
