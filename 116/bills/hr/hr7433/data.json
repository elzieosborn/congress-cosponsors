Specifically, borrowers are eligible to receive this deferment if (1) their spouse is an active duty service member of the Armed Forces, (2) they have lost their employment due to a permanent change in duty station of their spouse, and (3) they provide certain documentation to the Department of Education. Loan interest shall not accrue during the deferment period."
