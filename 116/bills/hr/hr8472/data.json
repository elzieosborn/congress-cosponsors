    "text": "Impact Aid Coronavirus Relief Act\n\nThis bill revises the Impact Aid Program application process for FY2022. It also revises FY2021 allocations under the Migrant Education Program.\n\nFirst, the bill requires local educational agencies (LEAs) participating in the Impact Aid Program to use the student count or federal property valuation data from their FY2021 program applications, as applicable, for their FY2022 program applications. The program provides funding to LEAs that have lost property tax revenue due to the presence of tax-exempt federal property or to those that have experienced increased expenditures due to enrollment of federally connected children (e.g., children living on Indian lands or military bases).\n\nIn addition, the bill directs the Department of Education to use school year 2018-2019 data or school year 2019-2020 data, whichever is greater, for making FY2021 allocations to states under the Migrant Education Program. States use these program funds to identify eligible migratory children and provide them with education and support services."
