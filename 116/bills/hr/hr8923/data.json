The bill also requires a health care practitioner or other employee to immediately report any failure to comply with this requirement to law enforcement.\n\nA person who violates the requirements is subject to criminal penalties\u2014a fine, up to five years in prison, or both.\n\nAdditionally, an individual who intentionally kills or attempts to kill a child born alive is subject to prosecution for murder.\n\nThe bill bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate these provisions, for being an accessory after the fact, or for concealment of a felony.\n\nA woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this bill."
