  <summary date="2021-09-22T10:54:39Z" status="Introduced in House">Protection of Born-Alive Abortion Survivors ActThis bill establishes requirements for the degree of care a health care practitioner must exercise in the event a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion.

 A health care practitioner who is present must exercise the same degree of care as reasonably provided to another child born alive at the same gestational age. The bill also requires a health care practitioner or other employee to immediately report any failure to comply with this requirement to law enforcement.

A person who violates the requirements is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, up to five years in prison, or both.

Additionally, an individual who intentionally kills or attempts to kill a child born alive is subject to prosecution for murder.

The bill bars the criminal prosecution of a mother of a child born alive for conspiracy to violate these provisions, for being an accessory after the fact, or for concealment of a felony.

A woman who undergoes an abortion or attempted abortion may file a civil action for damages against an individual who violates this bill.</summary>
