  <summary date="2020-04-01T13:57:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicaid Report on Expansion of Access to Coverage for Health Act or Medicaid REACH Act

This bill reduces federal payment for Medicaid administrative expenses incurred by states that have not elected to participate in Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (i.e., nonexpansion states) if the state does not comply with specified reporting requirements. The bill requires nonexpansion states to report, among other information,&#160;the number of uninsured individuals under the age of 65 and the estimated percentage of such individuals who would be eligible to receive coverage if the state expanded Medicaid.</summary>
