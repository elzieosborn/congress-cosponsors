  <summary date="2021-03-15T16:41:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Shovel-Ready Restoration Grants for Coastlines and Fisheries Act of 2020 

This bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a grant program to provide funding and technical assistance to states, tribal and local governments, and other entities to carry out projects that restore a marine, estuarine, coastal, or Great Lakes habitat, or to provide adaptation to climate change that protects coastal communities from sea level rise, coastal storms, or flooding, and blue carbon projects.

NOAA must give priority to projects

 that would stimulate the economy; for which the applicant can demonstrate that the grant will fund work that will begin not more than 90 days after the date of the award; for which the applicant can demonstrate that the grant will fund work that will employ fishermen who have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic or pay a fisherman for the use of a fishing vessel; for which the applicant can demonstrate that any preliminary study or permit required before the project can begin has been completed or can be completed shortly after an award is made; or that include communities that may not have adequate resources including low income communities, communities of color, tribal communities, and rural communities.</summary>
