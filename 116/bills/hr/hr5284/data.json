SAAs are state agencies responsible for approving and monitoring education and training programs for veterans who are using Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) education benefits.\n\nUnder the bill, the SAA shall be considered to have properly conducted its enforcement and approval duties if it has fulfilled its VA cooperative agreement requirements and has completed a risk-based program review of any program determined to be of questionable quality or at risk by government or accrediting agencies."
