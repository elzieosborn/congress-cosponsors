This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to share information about certain educational institutions with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and it requires the VA to undertake a risk analysis for such institutions.

Specifically, the bill requires ED to provide notice to the VA when it places an institution on heightened cash monitoring status due to a determination that the institution does not meet specific standards for the administration of a program of student financial aid.

Further, the bill requires the VA to conduct an analysis of the risk posed by such an institution to students who use educational assistance provided by the VA. The VA must then notify any individual pursuing a course or program of education at the institution and also publish such notice on online.</summary>
