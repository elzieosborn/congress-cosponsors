These substances are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain the compounds, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.\n\nThe interagency working group shall (1) provide for interagency coordination of federally funded PFAS research and development, and (2) develop and update every two years a strategic plan for federal support for PFAS research and development."
