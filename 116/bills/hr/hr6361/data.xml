This bill places restrictions on the collection of debts owed by small businesses and nonprofit organizations during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period. Among other things, debt collectors may not during such a period

 enforce a security interest through a repossession or foreclosure, commence or continue litigation to collect a debt, terminate utility service, seize assets, commence or continue an eviction, or charge fees or apply a higher interest rate as a result of nonpayment. After such a period, debt collectors must provide certain repayment options including extending the repayment period for debts.

Violations of these provisions are subject to civil enforcement.

The Federal Reserve Board must establish a facility to compensate loan holders for losses caused by the suspension of payments.</summary>
