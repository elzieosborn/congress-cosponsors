This bill authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD), upon request from Israel and with the concurrence of the Department of State, to jointly carry out research and testing of directed energy capabilities with Israel. (Directed energy systems are capable of converting chemical or electrical energy into radiated energy and focusing it on a target.) DOD may provide maintenance and sustainment support for such activities if Israel matches U.S. funds provided for such support or otherwise provides an amount that meets Israel's best efforts.

The bill imposes various reporting requirements related to such joint research.</summary>
