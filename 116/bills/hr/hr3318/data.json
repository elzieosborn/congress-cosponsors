The TSA must develop a threat mitigation strategy for each of the threats the task force examines in its analysis.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must conduct a review of the feasibility, risks, costs, and potential threat mitigation benefits of the TSA deploying its passenger and property screening assets to conduct screening in areas or facilities prior to passenger arrivals at airport terminals."
