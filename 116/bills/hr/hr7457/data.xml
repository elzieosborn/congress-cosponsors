  <summary date="2021-05-21T18:19:10Z" status="Introduced in House">Motor Carrier Safety Selection Standard Act 

This bill establishes a standard of care for the selection of brokers and other entities that contract with motor carriers for the shipment of goods or household goods. (A broker is a person, other than a motor carrier or an employee or agent of a motor carrier, that as a principal or agent sells, offers for sale, negotiates for, or holds itself out by solicitation, advertisement, or otherwise as selling, providing, or arranging for, transportation by motor carrier for compensation.)

Specifically, the bill requires such entities to verify that a transporting motor carrier (1) is properly registered with the Department of Transportation (DOT); (2) has obtained the minimum required insurance coverage; and (3) is not determined unfit to safely operate commercial motor vehicles, or otherwise ordered to discontinue operations by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or a state.

DOT must prescribe by regulation a process for revoking the registration of an owner or operator determined unfit to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle.</summary>
