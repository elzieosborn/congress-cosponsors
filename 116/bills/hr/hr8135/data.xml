This bill increases emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) benefits that were provided under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to households with children who would otherwise receive free or reduced-price school meals if their schools were not closed due to the COVID-19 (i.e. coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.

 Specifically, the bill provides such households with a $35 monthly increase in SNAP benefits to purchase fruits and vegetables.</summary>
