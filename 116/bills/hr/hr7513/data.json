Further, the bill requires Congress to provide a separate allocation, within the amounts made available for salaries and expenses of the USCP, for the salaries and expenses of the OIG. The OIG must make each of its reports publicly available.\n\nIn addition, the bill provides that an approval by the Capitol Police Board of the termination of an officer, member, or employee of the USCP shall be final and may not be reviewed or appealed. Under current law, the USCP may not terminate an officer, member, or employee until it has notified both the individual and the Capitol Police Board, and the board has approved the termination."
