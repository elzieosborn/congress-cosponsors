The title also specifies that a qualified MVPD buying group representing smaller MVPDs may negotiate retransmission consent with large broadcast station group owners without violating the good faith requirement if specified requirements are met.\n\nFurther, the title requires that providers of MVPD services (1) meet certain requirements for transparent advertising and billing, and (2) refrain from charging a consumer for using equipment not provided by the service provider.\n\nTITLE XI--ELIGIBILITY TO RECEIVE SIGNALS UNDER A DISTANT-SIGNAL SATELLITE LICENSE\n\nSatellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019\n\nThis title changes the definition of unserved households and permanently reauthorizes the statutory license that allows a satellite television carrier to retransmit distant television networks to those living in such households.\n\nSpecifically, the title redefines unserved households to include (1) subscribers in short markets (i.e., markets missing one or more of the four most widely viewed television networks nationwide), and (2) operators of recreational vehicles and commercial trucks. Further, it conditions a satellite carrier's eligibility to use the statutory license for unserved households on retransmitting local television broadcast stations in every designated market area (DMA) where there are qualified local broadcasters. Such license to retransmit to households in short markets is limited to importing distant signals of only those networks that are not offered in the local market.\n\nFurther, the title repeals provisions rendered inapplicable under the reconfigured license, and it establishes a transition period for a satellite carrier to provide service in all DMAs if it wants to continue using the statutory license.\n\nTITLE XII--GROUNDFISH TRAWL FISHERY\n\nThis title requires the Department of Commerce to forgive certain interest that accrued on a specified loan for the West Coast Groundfish fleet and is attributable to the delay in implementing a repayment system.\n\nTITLE XIII--TEMPORARY RELIEF FROM CERTAIN ERISA REQUIREMENTS Temporary Relief from Certain ERISA Requirements Act of 2020\n\nThis title removes certain restrictions on self-dealing transactions for pharmacy benefit services under group health plans sponsored by certain labor unions, regional councils, or affiliated labor organizations if specified conditions are met. Such conditions include that (1) the transaction or arrangement must be at least as favorable to the group health plan as would have been available by transacting with a third party, (2) at least 50% of the pharmacy benefit providers under the plan must be independent of the contributing employers or group health plan, (3) the plan must retain an independent fiduciary to monitor and make decisions concerning the provision of pharmacy benefits services, and (4) the arrangement must not be designed to benefit parties with a financial interest in the group health plan. Further, the tax on such exempted self-dealing arrangements also is suspended for five years.\n\nTITLE XIV--LIBRARY OF CONGRESS TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS\n\nLibrary of Congress Technical Corrections Act of 2019\n\n(Sec. 1402) This title increases from seven to nine the number of ex officio members on the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress by including the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services.\n\nThe salary of the Director of the Center shall be set in accordance with requirements for pay for certain senior-level positions.\n\n(Sec. 1403) This section authorizes the National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS) to provide certain accessible materials and reproducers to U.S. citizens residing outside of the United States.\n\nThe NLS may provide items delivered online to authorized entities located in a country that is a party to the Marrakesh Treaty. (The Marrakesh Treaty was adopted in 2013 by the World Intellectual Property Organization to address the widespread problem known as a book famine, the situation where few books are published in formats that are accessible to those who are blind or visually impaired.)\n\n(Sec. 1404) This section revises the method for determining the annual salary of the Deputy Librarian of Congress, the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), and the Register of Copyright. Such salaries are set at the greater of the salary for level III of the Executive Schedule or the maximum annual salary for certain senior-level positions at agencies with a certified performance appraisal system.\n\nFurthermore, this section requires the salary of the Deputy Director of CRS, Specialists and Senior Specialists of CRS, and the Associate Registers of Copyrights to be set in accordance with requirements for pay for certain senior-level positions.\n\n(Sec. 1405) This section removes the cap on the number of full-time personnel to assist the Copyright Royalty Judges in performing their functions. (Currently, the Chief Copyright Royalty Judge may only hire three full-time staffers.) It also replaces limitations on the salary of these staffers with a salary cap at step 10 of GS-15.\n\nTITLE XV--SENATE ENTITIES\n\n(Sec. 1501) This title increases the amount of funds that may be transferred from the expense account of the Office of the Secretary of the Senate to the expense account of the Secretary.\n\nThe Sergeant at Arms of the Senate may incur obligations and make expenditures for certain support and maintenance for Senators, Senate officers, and employees when such obligations and expenditures are necessary to respond to emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\n\nTITLE XVI--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH INSPECTORS GENERAL INDEPENDENCE\n\nLegislative Branch Inspectors General Independence Act of 2019\n\n(Sec. 1602) This title allows the transfer of the Inspectors General of the Library of Congress, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), and the Government Publishing Office (GPO) to another position within, or another location of, the respective entity.\n\nGuidelines are established for the salary of each Inspector General. The individual is prohibited from receiving cash awards or cash bonuses, including incentive awards. The Inspectors Generals must, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations governing selections, appointments, and employment at their respective entity, obtain legal advice from a counsel reporting directly to the respective Inspector General or another Inspector General.\n\n(Sec. 1603) Certain certified special agents under the respective Inspector General are granted law enforcement authority (i.e., making certain arrests, seeking and executing warrants, searching of a premises, seizing certain evidence, and carrying a firearm while engaged in authorized official duties).\n\n(Sec. 1604) The Library, the AOC, and the GPO must include the annual budget request of its Inspector General in their budget requests without change.\n\nBeginning in FY2021, Congress must provide, within the amounts made available for salaries and expenses of the Library, the AOC, and the GPO, a separate allocation for salaries and expenses of such entity's Inspector General.\n\n(Sec. 1605) This section modifies the hiring authority of the Inspectors General of the Library, the AOC, and the GPO by allowing them to carry out such authority without the supervision or approval of any other entity within their respective entities.\n\nTITLE XVII--MANAGING POLITICAL FUND ACTIVITY\n\n(Sec. 1701) This title authorizes the Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Minority Leader to each designate up to two (currently, one) employees of their respective leadership office staff as designees to perform political fund activity (i.e., receiving, soliciting, being a custodian of, or distributing funds in connection with any campaign for the nomination for election, or the election, of any Senator or to any other federal office).\n\nTITLE XVIII--KENTUCKY WILDLANDS NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA STUDY\n\nThis title requires the Department of the Interior to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating specified counties and other areas in the state of Kentucky as the Kentucky Wildlands National Heritage Area.\n\nTITLE XIX--INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n(Sec. 1901) This title authorizes the U.S. governor of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to vote to increase the bank's capital stock by specified amounts.
