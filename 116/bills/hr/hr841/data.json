The commission shall review all federal means-tested programs, excluding various specified programs such as the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits program, Medicare, and Department of Veterans Affairs-administered programs.\n\nThe commission's review shall cover topics including (1) ways to make the benefits programs more efficient and streamlined, (2) opportunities to reduce costs by contracting with private entities or delegating to states, (3) any programs that should be subject to discretionary appropriations, and (4) changes to allow caseworkers to have a holistic view of the beneficiary.\n\nThe commission shall report its findings to Congress, and the report shall include proposed legislation to carry out the commission's recommendations.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader shall introduce the proposed legislation in their respective chambers. The proposed legislation shall be considered under certain expedited procedures, such as\u00a0limitations on\u00a0debate."
