This bill provides deferment and cancellation of certain loans under the Federal Direct Loan program for qualified entrepreneurs.

Specifically, the bill allows a qualified entrepreneur with a loan under the Federal Direct Loan program to defer loan payments for up to three years. A qualified entrepreneur is a borrower who (1) receives a degree during the 10-year period before the borrower requests a deferment, (2) registers at least one business entity, (3) raises capital of not less than $15,000 for such business entity, and (4) has an outstanding loan balance of not less than $5,000.

The Department of Education may cancel up to $17,500 of Federal Direct Stafford Loans and Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans for a borrower who (1) has operated a small business located in a historically underutilized business zone for at least three years, and (2) is not currently in default on the loan.</summary>
