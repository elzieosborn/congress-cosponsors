A qualified entrepreneur is a borrower who (1) receives a degree during the 10-year period before the borrower requests a deferment, (2) registers at least one business entity, (3) raises capital of not less than $15,000 for such business entity, and (4) has an outstanding loan balance of not less than $5,000.\n\nThe Department of Education may cancel up to $17,500 of Federal Direct Stafford Loans and Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans for a borrower who (1) has operated a small business located in a historically underutilized business zone for at least three years, and (2) is not currently in default on the loan."
