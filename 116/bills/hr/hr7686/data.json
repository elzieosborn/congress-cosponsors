The Special Master must, within 120 days, review and make a decision concerning the claim, including making relevant determinations of economic and noneconomic losses. A claimant may appeal this decision to an Eligibility Committee established for this and other purposes.\n\nCompensation payments shall be made within 20 days of the Special Master's decision. The program terminates on January 1, 2035."
