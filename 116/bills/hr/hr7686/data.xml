  <summary date="2021-02-18T23:47:51Z" status="Introduced in House">COVID-19 Essential Workers Compensation Fund Act of 2020

This bill provides funding to compensate essential frontline workers who were seriously injured or died as a result of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) through a temporary program within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

To obtain compensation, a worker or decedent's representative must file a claim with the Special Master appointed by HHS to administer the program. The Special Master must, within 120 days, review and make a decision concerning the claim, including making relevant determinations of economic and noneconomic losses. A claimant may appeal this decision to an Eligibility Committee established for this and other purposes.

Compensation payments shall be made within 20 days of the Special Master's decision. The program terminates on January 1, 2035.</summary>
