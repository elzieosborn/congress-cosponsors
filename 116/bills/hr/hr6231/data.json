The requirement applies only: (1) to tests designated by the Department of Health and Human Services, and (2) during the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020. The bill also shortens to 15 business days the time frame under which the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices must issue a recommendation after a vaccine intended to treat or prevent COVID-19 is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration."
