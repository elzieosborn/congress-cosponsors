    "text": "For-Profit Fraud Act\n\nThis bill modifies requirements for a proprietary (i.e., for-profit) institution of higher education (IHE) to participate in federal student aid programs.\n\nCurrent law requires a proprietary IHE to derive at least 10% of its revenue from sources other than federal student aid. The bill requires a proprietary IHE to derive at least 15% of its revenue from sources other than federal funds (i.e., it replaces the so-called 90/10 rule with an 85/15 rule).\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Education to notify the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) when a proprietary institution becomes ineligible to participate in federal student aid programs and when the institution regains such eligibility. Proprietary institutions that lose such eligibility are then ineligible to receive educational assistance from DOD or VA programs."
