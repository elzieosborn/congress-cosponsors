        <text><![CDATA[ <p><b>Enhancing the Security of the U.S. Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Act of 2020</b></p> <p>This bill provides tax credits for manufacturing certain priority medicines and establishes an expedited review procedure for drug manufacturers seeking to transition from foreign manufacturing to domestic manufacturing. </p> <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must publish annually a list of priority drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients that (1) are necessary for use in a public health emergency, (2) are at high risk of becoming in short supply, and (3) have a vulnerable global supply chain. The bill provides a tax credit for 50% of a manufacturer's direct and indirect costs incurred in a taxable year for the production of a drug or active ingredient that was on this list in any of the five preceding years. </p> <p>Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must expedite the review and approval of a supplemental application that seeks to transfer manufacturing of an already-approved drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient to a domestic establishment. (A supplemental application generally involves a change, such as a manufacturing change, to an existing application for FDA market approval.) The bill imposes various requirements for this expedited review, including a deadline for the FDA to take action on such a supplemental application within six months of submission. </p> <p>HHS shall also establish the Facility Transfer Working Group to assist with evaluating such applications and provide advice and feedback to applicants upon request.</p>]]></text>
