This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to report on enrollment in the Lifeline program. The Lifeline program is designed to reduce the cost of communications services for low-income consumers, and it allows those consumers to qualify for Lifeline assistance based on their receipt of other federal assistance programs (e.g., Medicaid or Federal Public Housing Assistance).

Specifically, the FCC must submit reports on (1) enrollment in the Lifeline program by individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program), and (2) the number of new broadband consumers projected to join the Lifeline program through federal assistance programs and the efficacy of various efforts to advertise the Lifeline program.</summary>
