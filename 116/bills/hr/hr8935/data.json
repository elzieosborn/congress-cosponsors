    "text": "National Dam and Hydropower Safety Improvements Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take certain actions related to dam safety.\n\nSpecifically, the commission may issue a license for a dam and other project works only if the project meets the relevant safety requirements and the licensee can operate and manage the project works in a manner that ensures dam and public safety. A licensee with an already-issued license must also meet these safety requirements.\n\nThe commission shall also establish procedures to assess the financial viability of an applicant for such a license.\n\nThe commission's Office of Energy Projects must notify a state in certain situations, such as when the commission issues a finding that requires a dam operator in that state to make repairs.\n\nThe commission must also (1) hold a conference with states to discuss dam safety issues, and (2) report to Congress an assessment of the failures of the Edenville and Sanford dams in Michigan."
