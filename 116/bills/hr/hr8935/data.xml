This bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take certain actions related to dam safety.

Specifically, the commission may issue a license for a dam and other project works only if the project meets the relevant safety requirements and the licensee can operate and manage the project works in a manner that ensures dam and public safety. A licensee with an already-issued license must also meet these safety requirements.

The commission shall also establish procedures to assess the financial viability of an applicant for such a license.

The commission's Office of Energy Projects must notify a state in certain situations, such as when the commission issues a finding that requires a dam operator in that state to make repairs.

The commission must also (1) hold a conference with states to discuss dam safety issues, and (2) report to Congress an assessment of the failures of the Edenville and Sanford dams in Michigan.</summary>
