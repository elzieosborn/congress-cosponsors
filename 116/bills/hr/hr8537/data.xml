  <summary date="2020-11-04T13:36:18Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits the Small Business Administration from placing a cap that is less than $5,000 on any advance for an economic injury disaster loan that is made in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) to a veterans service organization (VSO) with only one employee.
