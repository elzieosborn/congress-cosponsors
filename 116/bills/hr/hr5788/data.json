These tabulations must identify whether a complaint alleged discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status. HUD must consider a complaint of sexual harassment under the category of discrimination based on sex and must include a separate tabulation of the total number of sexual harassment complaints filed.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ must establish an initiative to investigate and prosecute allegations of housing-related sexual harassment."
