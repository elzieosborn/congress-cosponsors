This bill requires a mobile or internet voice service provider to disclose, at the request of an investigative or law enforcement officer (or public safety employee or agent on behalf of such officer), the location information of a device if the officer asserts (1) that the device was used to place a 911 call, or (2) reasonable suspicion that the device is in the possession of an individual who is in an emergency situation.

The bill prohibits a civil action or administrative proceeding against a telecommunications carrier that discloses call location information in accordance with this bill.</summary>
