This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to conduct a study to determine the economic and environmental risks to the Great Lakes of oil or hazardous liquids spills or leaks from onshore, underwater pipeline facilities in the Straits of Mackinac.

In addition, DOT must evaluate the condition and structural integrity of the facilities.

DOT shall terminate operations of a facility upon a determination, based on such studies, that risk of hazard to life, property, or the environment warrants termination.</summary>
