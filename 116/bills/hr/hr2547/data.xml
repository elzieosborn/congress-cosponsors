This bill sets forth requirements for states using signature verification for ballots submitted by mail. These states must provide notice to individuals if the state determines a discrepancy exists between the submitted signature and the signature in the official record. The notice must include information regarding curing the discrepancy.

Additionally, these states must establish procedures for voters (1) to submit information to cure a discrepancy, and (2) to appeal a rejection of this information.

These states must report to Congress regarding the number of ballots invalidated due to a signature discrepancy, a description of attempts to notify voters of any discrepancy, a description of the cure process, and the number of ballots determined valid as a result.</summary>
