The notice must include information regarding curing the discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, these states must establish procedures for voters (1) to submit information to cure a discrepancy, and (2) to appeal a rejection of this information.\n\nThese states must report to Congress regarding the number of ballots invalidated due to a signature discrepancy, a description of attempts to notify voters of any discrepancy, a description of the cure process, and the number of ballots determined valid as a result."
