  <summary date="2020-10-13T17:13:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Make PPE in America Act

This bill requires procurement contracts for personal protective equipment (PPE) to be long-term and for domestically manufactured PPE.

Specifically, contracts entered into by the Departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Defense, Education, or Veterans Affairs for the procurement of PPE must be for a duration of at least three years, including a base period and all option periods, to incentivize investment in the production of PPE, and materials and components of PPE, in the United States.

The bill provides exceptions (1) where a nonavailability determination has been made, (2) where a sufficient quantity of a satisfactory quality cannot be procured as and when needed at U.S. market prices, and (3) where the department certifies every 120 days that it is necessary to procure PPE under alternate procedures to respond to the immediate needs of a public health emergency.

Such departments may transfer to the Strategic National Stockpile any excess PPE acquired under a contract.</summary>
