This bill provides for housing assistance during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency.

Specifically, tenants in certain federally assisted housing shall not be required to make rent payments from the date of the bill's enactment until six months after the end of the COVID-19 emergency declaration.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Agriculture must reimburse public housing agencies (PHAs) and owners of federally assisted housing for these suspended rent payments, including any increase in low-income housing choice voucher assistance payments made by PHAs to compensate for the suspended rent payments.</summary>
