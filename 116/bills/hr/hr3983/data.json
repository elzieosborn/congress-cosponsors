    "text": "Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act\n\nThis bill expands the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)to act as the lead agency for the purpose of coordinating all applicable federal authorizations and environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) with respect to authorizing a natural gas pipeline project under the Natural Gas Act.\n\nFederal, state, and local agencies involved in the environmental review process must defer to FERC's approved scope for a NEPA review.\n\nFERC must\n\n invite and designate the other participating agencies involved in the authorization process; track and publicly display on its website specific information related to the actions required to complete an authorization; and with respect to an authorization, consult with the Transportation Security Administration regarding pipeline infrastructure security, pipeline cybersecurity, pipeline personnel security, and other pipeline security measures. The bill establishes a 90 day deadline to complete an authorization application for other authorizing agencies and requires concurrent reviews when multiple agencies are involved in the authorization process.\n\nIf a federal or state agency considering an aspect of an application for authorization requires the person applying for such authorization to submit data, the agency must consider any such data gathered by aerial or other remote means that the person submits."
