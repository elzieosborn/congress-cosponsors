  <summary date="2019-11-18T14:52:09Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicaid Provisions and TANF Extenders Act of 2019

This bill reauthorizes and revises several Medicaid programs and funding mechanisms, as well as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.

Specifically, the bill

 makes appropriations for FY2019 for, and otherwise revises, the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration Program; temporarily extends the applicability of Medicaid eligibility criteria that protect against spousal impoverishment for recipients of home and community-based services; reduces the federal medical assistance percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) for states that have not implemented asset-verification programs for determining Medicaid eligibility; reduces funding available to the Medicaid Improvement Fund beginning in FY2021; reauthorizes through FY2020 several grant programs under TANF, such as family assistance grants; and revises state reporting requirements under TANF to include specified employment data, such as employment outcomes for former TANF recipients.</summary>
