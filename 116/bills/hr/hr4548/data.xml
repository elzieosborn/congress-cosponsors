This bill permits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to award grants to address childhood asthma in rural and underserved communities.

Counties with high prevalence of asthma among children (12% or higher) may use grants to support mobile clinics, distance learning, and telemedicine to increase access to asthma diagnosis, treatment, and education. Grantees may award subgrants to schools, hospitals, or other organizations to achieve the goals of the program.

The CDC must also study issues related to asthma in&#160;rural areas.</summary>
