This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that each of its medical centers has at least one full-time suicide prevention coordinator.

The VA must also ensure that its medical centers report to the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention regarding hiring plans to reach the recommended number of suicide prevention coordinators based on the current staffing model. Additionally, the VA must consider and implement findings from the assessment of the Government Accountability Office of the responsibilities, workload, and vacancy rates for suicide prevention coordinators.

The VA must conduct a study to determine the feasibility and advisability of the realignment and reorganization of suicide prevention coordinators within the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and the creation of a suicide prevention coordinator program office.</summary>
