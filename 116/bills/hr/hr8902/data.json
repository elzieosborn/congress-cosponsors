    "text": "Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2020\n\nThis bill generally revises consumer bankruptcy law by establishing a new Chapter 10 for individual debtors with not more than $7.5 million in debt. The bill eliminates the ability of individual debtors to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy and repeals Chapter 13, which requires individual debtors to comply with a repayment plan to receive a discharge of debt.\n\nUnder Chapter 10, debtors may receive a discharge of debt through making minimum payment obligations based on the debtor's assets and income which may result in immediate discharge for individuals with no minimum payment obligation. The bill also provides for residential protections for debtors and revises what type of debt is dischargeable in bankruptcy. An individual may obtain a discharge under Chapter 10 once every six years.\n\nIndividuals may seek limited bankruptcy proceedings on certain debts, such as a home mortgage.\n\nThe bill also establishes consumer bankruptcy protections, including by creating a Consumer Bankruptcy Ombuds at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."
