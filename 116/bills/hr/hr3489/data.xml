This bill requires the Department of Education to establish an Advisory Commission on Serving and Supporting Students with Mental Health Disabilities in Institutions of Higher Education. The commission must conduct a study and report on (1) services available to students with mental health disabilities in institutions of higher education (IHEs) and the effectiveness of such services in supporting these students; (2) the impact of policies and procedures, such as reasonable accommodation and disciplinary policies, that help or hinder the goal of providing equal opportunity to these students; (3) the use of protected health information of these students by IHEs; (4) the impact of providing mental health services on a student's academic performance, well-being, and ability to complete college; (5) conclusions on the major challenges facing these students; and (6) recommendations to improve the overall education, retention, and graduation rates of these students.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to submit a report on the challenges faced by students with mental health disabilities in IHEs.</summary>
