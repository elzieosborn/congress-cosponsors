  <summary date="2020-10-23T15:34:37Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires certain government officials in the executive branch and their spouses to divest corporate and other financial interests.

Specifically, such officials must divest into a qualified blind trust any financial interest in a business for which the official is a trustee, partner, officer, director, or more than 10% shareholder. The trustee of the qualified blind trust must sell the interest and use the proceeds to purchase conflict-free holdings.

The bill's requirements apply to cabinet officials, senior executives, policy advisors, presidential appointees, specified White House personnel, and their spouses.</summary>
