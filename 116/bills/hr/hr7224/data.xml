This bill specifies that an immigrant who is a current or former member or affiliate of the Chinese Communist Party is inadmissible into the United States. (The current statute generally prohibits the admission of current or former members or affiliates of the Communist Party or any other totalitarian party.)

The bill also repeals two exceptions to this prohibition for an alien who does not pose a security threat to the United States, specifically (1) an exception for an alien who is no longer a member of the organization in question, and (2) a waiver for certain close family members of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.</summary>
