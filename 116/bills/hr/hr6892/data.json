    "text": "This bill expands existing COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) economic aid programs to include nonprofit organizations and institutions of higher education. Specifically, the Federal Reserve Board must make these organizations eligible for the Main Street Lending Program, which is currently available to small- and mid-sized businesses.\n\nThe board must create low-cost loan options for nonprofit organizations, as well offer loan forgiveness to certain nonprofit organizations that predominately serve low-income communities.\n\nThe Main Street Lending Program must offer loans that do not have a minimum loan size and includes the ability to defer payments without capitalization of interest to small businesses, nonprofits, and institutions of higher education. The board must authorize community development financial institutions to be eligible lenders."
