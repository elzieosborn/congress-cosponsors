This bill imposes additional immigration-related penalties for aliens who vote in an election for federal office.

 It shall be an aggravated felony for an alien who is unlawfully present to violate an existing prohibition against an alien voting in a federal election. (An aggravated felony conviction carries various immigration consequences, such as rendering the alien inadmissible, deportable, and barred from establishing good moral character for naturalization.)

An alien who is unlawfully present and who knowingly violates the prohibition against voting in a federal election shall be deportable.</summary>
