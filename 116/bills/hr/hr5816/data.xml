  <summary date="2021-04-08T21:30:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Continuing Care for Patients Act of 2020 This bill requires private health insurance plans to continue providing benefits to continuing care patients when the contractual relationship with the provider or facility treating such patient changes or terminates. Continuing care patients include individuals undergoing (1) inpatient care, (2) care for pregnancy, (3) nonelective surgery, (4) treatment for a terminal illness, or (5) treatment for other serious condition that requires prolonged medical care. Among other requirements, health insurance plans must notify continuing care patients about a termination of coverage and permit such patients to continue treatment under the plan, including transition to another health care setting, for not more than 90 days after that date that such notice is provided.</summary>
