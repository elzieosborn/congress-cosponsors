Continuing care patients include individuals undergoing (1) inpatient care, (2) care for pregnancy, (3) nonelective surgery, (4) treatment for a terminal illness, or (5) treatment for other serious condition that requires prolonged medical care. Among other requirements, health insurance plans must notify continuing care patients about a termination of coverage and permit such patients to continue treatment under the plan, including transition to another health care setting, for not more than 90 days after that date that such notice is provided."
