Further, an entity that received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 may not apply for or use grant amounts for the same expenses for which it received the paycheck protection loan. Allowable uses for grant amounts include payroll costs, mortgage or rent payments, utilities, and maintenance expenses."
