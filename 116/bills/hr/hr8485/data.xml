  <summary date="2020-11-04T13:56:43Z" status="Introduced in House">Health and Fitness Recovery Act of 2020 

This bill establishes through December 31, 2020, and provides funding for the Health Club Recovery Fund, from which the Department of the Treasury shall make grants to eligible health and fitness facilities to provide relief during the COVID-19 (i.e.,coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

For the grant program's initial period, Treasury must (1) prioritize awarding grants to entities serving marginalized and underrepresented communities, and (2) only award grants to eligible health and fitness facilities with annual revenues of less than $1.5 million. Further, an entity that received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 may not apply for or use grant amounts for the same expenses for which it received the paycheck protection loan. Allowable uses for grant amounts include payroll costs, mortgage or rent payments, utilities, and maintenance expenses.</summary>
