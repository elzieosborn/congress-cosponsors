  <summary date="2021-12-10T14:09:35Z" status="Introduced in House">The Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act

This bill provides continuing appropriations to prevent a government shutdown if any appropriations measure for a fiscal year has not been enacted before the fiscal year begins or a joint resolution making continuing appropriations is not in effect.

If the continuing appropriations have been in effect for more than 30 days and an appropriations measure or a continuing resolution still has not been enacted, the bill withholds the salaries of Members of Congress and generally prohibits federal funds from being used for travel, bonuses and other pay incentives, official reception and representation expenses, and the operation of an exercise facility or golf course.</summary>
