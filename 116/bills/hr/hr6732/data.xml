  <summary date="2020-05-21T17:44:52Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to modify certain regulations relating to insurance-dedicated exchange-traded funds. An exchange-traded fund is a regulated investment company, partnership, or trust (1) that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an open-end investment company or a unit investment trust, (2) the shares of which can be purchased or redeemed directly from the fund only by an authorized participant (i.e., a financial institution that is a member or participant of a registered clearing agency), and (3) the shares of which are traded throughout the day on a national stock exchange at market prices that may or may not be the same as the net asset value of the shares.</summary>
