This bill prohibits a state from requiring a manufacturer, developer, seller, or provider of a technology product or service to (1) alter the security functions of its product or service to allow a government agency to conduct a physical search or user surveillance, or (2) use its product or service to decrypt encrypted information.

A technology product or service includes a commercial computer product, electronic device, or online service that is publicly available.

Additionally, it bars a state from prohibiting the manufacture, sale or lease, or provision of a technology product or service because it uses encryption or similar security functions.</summary>
