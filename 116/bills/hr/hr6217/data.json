    "text": "Health, Opportunity, and Personal Empowerment Act of 2020 or the HOPE Act of 2020\n\nThis bill establishes several Health, Opportunity, and Personal Empowerment (HOPE) pilot projects to improve economic security for individuals who meet income or other requirements. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development must collaborate on the projects and report to Congress on project implementation and outcomes.\n\nThe HOPE Accounts Pilots provide awards to certain nonprofits to assist eligible individuals in establishing HOPE accounts through banks, credit unions, or governmental agencies. Through technology platforms and other means, HOPE accounts must (1) provide access to specified financial services and information related to public benefits, health insurance, and other topics; and (2) facilitate activities such as applying for government benefits and filing taxes. HHS, in consultation with the other departments, must also hold a merit-based competition to award contracts to private businesses and nonprofits to develop technology applications and other tools for HOPE accounts.\n\nGrants for the HOPE Action Plans Pilot Projects allow nonprofits to enter voluntary agreements with eligible individuals to carry out long-term plans related to improving economic security and upward mobility."
