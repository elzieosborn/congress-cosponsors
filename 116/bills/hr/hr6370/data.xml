  <summary date="2020-04-21T15:26:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Disaster Protection for Workers' Credit Act 

This bill provides credit protections to consumers during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak and other major disasters. The bill generally prohibits furnishers of credit information from reporting adverse credit information that is the result of any inaction or action that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also prohibits any such reporting regarding a consumer who resides in an area covered by a major disaster declaration. Additionally, medical debt related to the COVID-19 outbreak or a major disaster may not be reported to a consumer reporting agency regardless of when the expenses were incurred.

Credit reporting agencies are prohibited from including in a credit report any such adverse credit information.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must create a website that allows consumers to report economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak or a major disaster. Consumers may request the deletion of adverse credit information and request an extension of certain credit protections.

Credit reporting agencies must provide unlimited free credit reports and free credit scores upon request (1) during the COVID-19 outbreak or a major disaster, and (2) for a year afterwards.

The bill places restrictions on new credit scoring models created or implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak or a major disaster.</summary>
