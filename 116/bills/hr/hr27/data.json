(A baseline is a projection of federal spending and receipts during a fiscal year under current law.)\n\nThe bill changes the assumptions used for the discretionary spending baseline to eliminate adjustments required under current law for inflation, expiring housing contracts, social insurance administrative expenses, pay adjustments, and changes to other personnel benefits. The bill also prohibits adjustments for inflation or any other factor."
