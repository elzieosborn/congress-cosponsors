This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award a grant to a health care organization to promote student access to defibrillation in elementary and secondary schools.

Specifically, such access shall be achieved in such schools by

 developing and providing comprehensive materials to establish defibrillation programs, providing support for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator (AED) training programs, fostering new and existing community partnerships to promote the importance of defibrillation, establishing a clearinghouse database to gather information in a central location regarding sudden cardiac arrest in the pediatric population, and providing assistance to secondary school athletic departments for screening student athletes for risk of sudden cardiac arrest.</summary>
