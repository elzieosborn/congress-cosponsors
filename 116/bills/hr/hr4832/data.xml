  <summary date="2019-11-15T17:28:04Z" status="Introduced in House">Low-Income Water Customer Assistance Programs Act of 2019

This bill addresses the access of low-income households to drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater services.

Specifically, the bill establishes new pilot programs that award grants to help low-income households pay their drinking water, wastewater, or stormwater bills.

In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency must study the prevalence of low-income households that do not have access to

 affordable, functional wastewater services that protect the health of individuals in the households; affordable municipal stormwater services; or affordable public drinking water services.</summary>
