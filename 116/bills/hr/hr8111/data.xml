This bill increases the penalties for violations and expands the scope of provisions that prohibit certain political activity by federal employees in the executive branch (commonly referred to as the Hatch Act).

Specifically, the bill (1) increases the maximum period of debarment from federal employment for violations from 5 years to 7 years; (2) increases the maximum civil penalty for violations from $1,000 to $50,000; and (3) explicitly includes the White House and surrounding grounds, including the Rose Garden but excluding the executive residence, as locations in which employees may not engage in political activity.</summary>
