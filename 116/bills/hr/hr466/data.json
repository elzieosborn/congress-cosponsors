    "text": "Amateur Radio Parity Act of 2019\n\nThis bill prohibits private rules, such as those imposed by a community association, that prevent an amateur radio operator from installing an outdoor antenna.\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits a private land-use restriction from being applied to an amateur radio service if such restriction\n\n precludes amateur radio service communications, prevents an amateur radio service from installing an outdoor antenna on property under the exclusive use or control of the radio service, or imposes more than the minimum practicable restriction on amateur radio communications. The bill requires an amateur radio service to obtain prior approval from a community association before installing an outdoor antenna and allows an association to establish reasonable installation rules for outdoor antennas."
