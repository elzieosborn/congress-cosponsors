A violation of this requirement shall be treated as a violation of a federal motor vehicle safety standard.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) shall establish a program to provide school buses with seat belts and other safety features, under which DOT may make a competitive grant to a state educational agency and a local educational agency to (1) retrofit a school bus with seat belts, or (2) make another safety upgrade to a school bus that demonstrably decreases the risk of injury or death to students in the event of an impact or rollover."
