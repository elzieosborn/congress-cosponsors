This bill permits an assembled land exchange (i.e., an exchange of federal land for a package of multiple ownership parcels of non-federal land consolidated for purposes of one land exchange transaction) to be used to carry out provisions pertaining to California State School lands through the sale of surplus federal property and subsequent acquisitions of such land.

Past and future receipts from the sale of such property, less any costs incurred related to the sale, shall be deposited in a Special Deposit Fund Account.

Funds accumulated in the special account may be used by the Department of the Interior to acquire state school lands or an interest in the lands.</summary>
