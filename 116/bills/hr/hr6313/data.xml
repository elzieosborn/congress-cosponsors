This bill makes changes to nutrition services for older adults as part of the response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public health emergency. Specifically, it (1) expands eligibility for home-delivered meals to eligible individuals who are unable to obtain nutrition as a result of COVID-19 response measures such as quarantines; (2) allows&#160;states to transfer funds,&#160;in greater amounts and without prior approval,&#160;between congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs during the emergency; and (3) authorizes the Administration on Aging to waive certain nutrition requirements for congregate and home-delivered meals during the emergency.</summary>
