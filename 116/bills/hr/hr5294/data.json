The CFPB must also establish a student loan servicing interagency working group, which shall make recommendations for the regulations required under the bill.\n\nFurther, the CFPB must issue rules to establish standards for the furnishing of information related to student loans to a consumer reporting agency, and any furnisher of such information must comply with such rules.\n\nA private educational lender must, in general, obtain a private loan certification from an institution of higher education before consummating any loan with a student attending such institution."
