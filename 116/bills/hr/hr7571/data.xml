This bill modifies requirements relating to coverage of certain telehealth services under Medicare. Specifically, the bill removes restrictions that require the originating site (i.e., the location of the beneficiary) to be in certain rural areas and to be a specific type of facility, if the services (1) are mental health services furnished in a frontier state, or (2) are furnished in an Indian Health Service facility.

Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Agriculture must award grants for broadband infrastructure in frontier states to support the provision of mental health services via telehealth under Medicare.</summary>
