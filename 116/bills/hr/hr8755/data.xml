  <summary date="2021-02-01T18:46:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expanded Telehealth Access Act

 This bill permanently allows audiologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and other providers designated by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide telehealth services under Medicare, and includes specified related services as eligible Medicare telehealth services.

Currently, the CMS is authorized to waive requirements for Medicare telehealth services during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), and it has done so to allow all providers that are otherwise eligible to furnish in-person services under Medicare to also furnish telehealth services.</summary>
