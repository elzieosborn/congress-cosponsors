The amount of the credit may not exceed $250,000 in any taxable year and is not available to taxpayers whose gross receipts exceed $100 million in a taxable year.\n\nThe bill defines livestock processing facility as a facility that slaughters livestock (i.e., cattle, sheep, goats, bison, swine, and poultry) for processing into meat and meat products and participates in a meat and poultry inspection program, The facility must employ an average of fewer than 500 employees and include property used for the intake or storage of livestock, the disposal or management of livestock waste, or the packaging, handling, warehousing, or storage of meat products.\n\nThe bill also allows a refundable income tax credit for the startup and organizational expenditures of livestock processing facilities."
