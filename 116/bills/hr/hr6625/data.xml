  <summary date="2020-06-12T14:08:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Cruise Reform and Uniform Industry Standards Evoke Integrity Act or the CRUISE Integrity Act 

This bill establishes requirements for cruise lines to receive federal funds and federal assistance, including a direct loan, loan guarantee, or tax credit.

The bill prohibits cruise lines from receiving federal funds and federal assistance unless such cruise lines

 are incorporated in the United States; have at least 50% of vessels registered in the United States; certify compliance with certain requirements, including that they are in compliance with all applicable environmental dumping laws; offer full reimbursement to passengers for cancellations related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019); agree not to use funds to purchase an equity security, pay dividends or other capital investments until one year after the date the loans are repaid in full; and develop a plan to reduce total emissions of such cruise line of carbon, methane, nitrogen oxides, and Black Carbon, including by reducing the use of heavy fuel oil and exhaust gas systems. Additionally, the bill (1) establishes a program to require monitoring and inspections of the compliance of cruise vessels with environmental standards; (2) prohibits a cruise vessel departing from or calling on a port of the United States from discharging sewage, graywater, bilge water, or exhaust gas scrubber effluent into navigable waters and territorial seas, with specified exceptions; (3) increases civil penalties for violations; and (4) sets forth medical standards for cruise vessels.</summary>
