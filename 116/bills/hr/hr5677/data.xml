  <summary date="2020-02-11T18:08:13Z" status="Introduced in House">Fair Credit Reporting for Servicemembers Act This bill revises consumer credit protections for servicemembers. Among other things, the bill (1) extends consumer credit protections to certain active duty uniformed consumers in a combat zone or aboard a U.S. vessel, and (2) prohibits the inclusion on a consumer report of adverse credit information that occurred while a uniformed consumer was engaged in that type of active duty.

The bill also adds to those groups covered by specified active duty credit protections individuals in the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Public Health Service.</summary>
