This bill sets out an alternative method to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits and requires the Social Security Administration to use whichever method results in a greater increase each year.

The current method is based on the annual change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which may result in no or small increases to benefits in years with deflation or low inflation. The alternative method established by this bill is based on a 10-year average of cost-of-living adjustments.</summary>
