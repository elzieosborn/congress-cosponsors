    "text": "Supporting America's Young Entrepreneurs Act of 2019\n\nThis bill makes eligible for deferment and cancelation of student loan debt a recent graduate of a four-year institution of higher education (IHE) who works at certain small business start-ups in distressed areas.\n\nSpecifically, it makes a student loan borrower who is an employee and founder of a start-up eligible for deferment and cancellation of student loans. In addition, the bill makes a full-time employee of a start-up eligible for cancelation of student loan debt.\n\nIt also excludes from an individual's gross income, for income tax purposes, the amount of such canceled student loan debt.\n\nFinally, it establishes a young entrepreneurs business center within the Small Business Administration to certify small business start-ups, identify distressed areas, and approve loan cancellations. To be certified by the center, a start-up must (1) have a founder who is a recent graduate of a four-year IHE, and (2) employ a certain number of recent graduates."
