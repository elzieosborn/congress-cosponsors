This bill establishes a new tax credit for wages and tangible investments made by U.S. domestic corporations with branches operating in U.S. territories. It requires that 80% of credible income must be derived from a territory during a 3-year period, and 75% must come from an active trade or business in a territory. The credit is equal to 40% of eligible wages and benefits paid or provided to employees in the territory, subject to certain limitations.</summary>
