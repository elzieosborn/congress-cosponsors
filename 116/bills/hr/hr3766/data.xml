This bill requires a federal agency that issues a license for the conduct of a lunar activity to require that each license applicant agree to abide by recommendations, guidelines, or principles issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) related to the protection and preservation of U.S. government lunar artifacts.

A federal agency may

 exempt specific activities from such an agreement if the activities have legitimate and significant historical, archaeological, anthropological, scientific, or engineering value; assess a penalty fee for violations of such an agreement.</summary>
