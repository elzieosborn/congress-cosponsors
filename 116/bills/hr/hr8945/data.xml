This bill provides that the federal cost share for fire management assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act shall not be less than 75% of the cost of such assistance.

The bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop guidelines and a rule that establish thresholds for cases in which the federal cost share for fire management assistance may be increased. Such thresholds shall use a fire-specific metric to determine fire damage and recommend a federal cost share adjustment for fire damage that meets the established thresholds.</summary>
