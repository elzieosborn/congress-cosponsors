This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise venture capital investment regulations. Specifically, the bill allows investments acquired through secondary transactions to be considered as qualifying investments for venture capital funds. However, for a private fund to qualify as a venture capital fund, the investments predominately must be acquired directly. Under current law, non-qualifying investments&#8212;which include secondary transactions&#8212;may comprise up to 20% of a venture capital fund.</summary>
