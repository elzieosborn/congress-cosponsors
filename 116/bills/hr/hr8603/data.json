Specifically, the bill allows investments acquired through secondary transactions to be considered as qualifying investments for venture capital funds. However, for a private fund to qualify as a venture capital fund, the investments predominately must be acquired directly. Under current law, non-qualifying investments\u2014which include secondary transactions\u2014may comprise up to 20% of a venture capital fund."
