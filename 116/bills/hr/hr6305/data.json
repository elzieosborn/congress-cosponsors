The funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.\n\nIn addition, the bill (1) temporarily requires state Medicaid programs to provide Medicare cost-sharing assistance to certain individuals who qualify for, or are enrolled in, the low-income subsidy program under the Medicare prescription drug benefit; and (2) authorizes a grant program to support Medicaid home- and community-based services during the public health emergency."
