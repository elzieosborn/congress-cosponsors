    "text": "Crags, Colorado Land Exchange Act of 2019\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA), if the Broadmoor Hotel, Inc. (BHI) offers to convey to USDA 320 acres of specified nonfederal land in the Pike National Forest in Teller County, Colorado, and a permanent trail easement for the Barr Trail in El Paso County, Colorado, to accept the offer and convey to the BHI 83 acres of specified federal land within the forest, together with a non-exclusive perpetual access easement for the BHI to and from such land on Forest Service Road (FSR) 371. The nonexclusive perpetual access easement granted to the BHI shall allow (1) the BHI to fully maintain, at its own expense, and use FSR 371 from its junction with FSR 368 in accordance with historic BHI use and maintenance patterns; and (2) full and continued public and administrative access and use of FSR 371 in accordance with the existing Forest Service travel management plan, or as it may be revised by USDA.\n\nUSDA shall determine the values of the lands to be exchanged through appraisals. The values shall be equal, or if they are not equal, shall be equalized as prescribed by this bill.\n\nThe Barr Trail easement donation shall not be appraised for purposes of this bill.\n\nThe land acquired by USDA under this bill shall become part of the Pike-San Isabel National Forest."
