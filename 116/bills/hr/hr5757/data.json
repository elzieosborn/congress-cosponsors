    "text": "Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment Act or the Military SAVE Act\n\nThis bill addresses care for covered veterans who are seeking counseling, care, or services related to sexual trauma determined by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care professional to have occurred while the veteran was on active duty or in active or inactive training. A covered veteran is a veteran who is (1) enrolled in the VA health care system; or (2) not enrolled in the VA health care system but is otherwise entitled to hospital care, medical services, or extended care services due to a specified disability.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to provide hospital care, medical services, and extended care services to a covered veteran at a non-VA provider under the Veterans Community Care Program if such veteran is seeking counseling, care, or services related to such sexual trauma. The decision to receive such care from a non-VA provider shall be at the election of the veteran.\n\nThe VA must provide information regarding the counseling, care, and services available through the VA to the covered veteran who is seeking counseling, care, or services related to sexual trauma.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the VA to provide counseling and treatment for any condition determined to have resulted from a sexual trauma that occurred while the covered veteran was on active duty or in active or inactive training (previously only psychological trauma was eligible)."
