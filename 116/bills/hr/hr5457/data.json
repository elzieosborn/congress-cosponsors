    "text": "Carbon Reduction and Tax Credit Act \n\nThis bill imposes an excise tax based on the carbon content of fuel. The tax is equal to $40 per ton of carbon contained in fuel (1) produced at a coal mine or an oil or gas well located in the United States; or (2) entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing. The bill requires the tax rate to be adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe bill also allows a refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 for each individual taxpayer and each dependent of the taxpayer. The credit must be reduced by a specified amount if the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $314,000 ($157,000 in the case of a return other than a joint return). The bill requires that the dollar amounts of the credit be adjusted for inflation and specifies that nonresident aliens are ineligible for the credit."
