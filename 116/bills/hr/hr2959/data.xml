This bill makes it a crime to knowingly import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon (SAW) or large capacity ammunition feeding device (LCAFD).

The prohibition does not apply to a firearm that is (1) manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action; (2) permanently inoperable; (3) an antique; or (4) a rifle or shotgun specifically identified by make and model.

The bill also exempts from the prohibition the following, with respect to a SAW or LCAFD

 importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession related to certain law enforcement efforts, or authorized tests or experiments; importation, sale, transfer, or possession related to securing nuclear materials; and possession by a retired law enforcement officer. Further, the bill exempts from the prohibition the possession or storage of a SAW at a shooting range, shooting gallery, or hunting club.

Finally, the bill requires the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to operate a buy-back program to purchase and destroy SAWs and LCAFDs.</summary>
