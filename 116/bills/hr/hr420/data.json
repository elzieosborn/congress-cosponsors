A violator is subject to criminal penalties\u2014a fine, a prison term of up to one year, or both.\n\n Additionally, the bill requires importers, manufacturers, and sellers of marijuana products to obtain a permit from the Department of the Treasury. Further, it prohibits these individuals from using deceptive practices to advertise marijuana products.\n\nThe bill specifies that the Food and Drug Administration shall have the same authorities with respect to marijuana as it has for alcohol.\n\nIt also transfers jurisdiction related to marijuana from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The ATF is renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Marijuana, Firearms and Explosives. Further, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is renamed the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Marijuana Tax and Trade Bureau."
