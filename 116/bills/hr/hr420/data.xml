  <summary date="2021-02-09T17:30:50Z" status="Introduced in House">Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act 

This bill removes marijuana from the list of controlled substances and establishes requirements for the regulation of marijuana products.

First, the bill directs the Department of Justice to remove marijuana from all schedules of controlled substances.

Next, it prohibits marijuana from being shipped or transported into any state or jurisdiction where it is illegal. A violator is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to one year, or both.

 Additionally, the bill requires importers, manufacturers, and sellers of marijuana products to obtain a permit from the Department of the Treasury. Further, it prohibits these individuals from using deceptive practices to advertise marijuana products.

The bill specifies that the Food and Drug Administration shall have the same authorities with respect to marijuana as it has for alcohol.

It also transfers jurisdiction related to marijuana from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The ATF is renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Marijuana, Firearms and Explosives. Further, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is renamed the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Marijuana Tax and Trade Bureau.</summary>
