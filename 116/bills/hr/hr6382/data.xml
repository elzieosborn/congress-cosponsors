This bill provides support for fair housing enforcement during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) public-health emergency. Specifically, the bill

 authorizes additional grants under the Fair Housing Initiatives Program and the Fair Housing Assistance Program, both administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); authorizes additional staffing for the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to respond to fair housing complaints arising out of the emergency; authorizes the office to&#160;carry out&#160;a national media campaign to inform the public of expanded housing rights during the emergency; and requires HUD to prohibit owners of federally assisted dwellings from showing occupied&#160;units to prospective tenants during the emergency.</summary>
