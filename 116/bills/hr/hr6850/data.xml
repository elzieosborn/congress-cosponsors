This bill prohibits the transference or assignment of a 2020 recovery rebate by legal process, including attachment, levy, or garnishment. Additionally, credit unions and depository institutions are prohibited from seizing a rebate to pay an amount due to them. A 2020 recovery rebate is a stimulus payment made to individual taxpayers and their dependents who have been affected by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.</summary>
