This bill increases the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for all states and U.S. territories during the public health emergency declared on January 31, 2020, relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), in accordance with specified conditions. For example, in order to receive the increased FMAP, a state Medicaid program may not require standards for eligibility that are more restrictive than the standards that were in effect on January 1, 2020.

The bill also increases Medicaid funding for U.S. territories for FY2020-FY2021.</summary>
