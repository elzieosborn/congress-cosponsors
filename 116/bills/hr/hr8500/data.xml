This bill establishes an electronic system within the Department of Justice for members of the press to file complaints alleging misconduct by law enforcement agencies and officers.

Law enforcement agencies must respond to complaints within 60 days as a condition of receiving certain funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program and participating in the Department of Defense program related to surplus military equipment (known as the 1033 program).</summary>
