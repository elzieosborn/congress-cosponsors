This bill revises the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program and the Secure Our Schools (SOS) grant program.

First, it reauthorizes through FY2020 the COPS program and otherwise revises the program to (1) restore authority to make COPS grants for hiring and rehiring additional career law enforcement officers, (2) specify the minimum amount of funds to be made available for hiring and rehiring additional career law enforcement officers, and (3) decrease the federal match from 75% to 50%.

In addition, the bill revises the SOS program to require a school to complete a facilities risk assessment in order for a state, local government, or Indian tribe to use grant funds to improve security at such school and on its grounds.</summary>
