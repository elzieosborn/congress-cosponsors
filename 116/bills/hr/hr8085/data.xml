This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish and carry out pilot safety-enhancing testing programs through FY2026 to evaluate innovative technologies and operational practices testing the safe operation of natural gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities.

Such programs (1) may not exceed 5% of the total pipeline mileage of all hazardous liquid or natural gas pipelines in the United States; (2) are prohibited from being conducted in high population areas, high consequence areas, or unusually sensitive areas; and (3) are limited to a duration of four years.

DOT may select up to five owners or operators of pipeline facilities to carry out a testing program under a single application.

The bill allows states to opt-out of the testing programs.</summary>
