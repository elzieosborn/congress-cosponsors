This bill revises the framework governing the prevention of online sexual exploitation of children.

Among other things, the bill does the following:

 establishes the National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention; directs the commission to develop best practices for interactive online service providers (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) to prevent the online sexual exploitation of children; requires interactive online service providers to certify compliance with the best practices (or implement other reasonable practices to prevent the online sexual exploitation of children), or else lose liability protections from claims alleging violations of child sexual exploitation laws; and replaces statutory references to child pornography with child sexual abuse material.</summary>
