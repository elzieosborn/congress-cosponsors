  <summary date="2020-07-27T22:08:53Z" status="Introduced in House">Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness Act

This bill requires several federal agencies to provide education and training related to synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and its analogues. Specifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must launch a public education campaign on the dangers of synthetic opioids and related issues, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) must produce training materials to prevent exposure to synthetic opioids for first responders and others who are&#160;at high risk of such exposure. In addition, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must disseminate the NIOSH training to ambulance transport personnel, local sheriff deputies, and other first responders and individuals in high-risk occupations.</summary>
