This bill provides for penalties for countries that refuse or delay repatriation of certain nationals ordered to be removed from the United States.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall establish procedures for determining whether a foreign country is systematically and unreasonably refusing or delaying repatriation of that country's nationals ordered removed from the United States who (1) have been convicted of a felony or crime of violence, or (2) are a threat to national security or public safety.

The Department of State and DHS shall notify representatives of a country found to be engaging in such behavior that the United States may stop issuing visas to that country's nationals. If the country continues to systematically and unreasonably refuse or delay repatriation of the&#160;individuals described in this bill, the State Department shall stop issuing visas to nationals of that country.</summary>
