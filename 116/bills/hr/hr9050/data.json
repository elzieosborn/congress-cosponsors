    "text": "This bill provides for additional 2020 recovery rebates (i.e., refundable tax credits) for individual taxpayers whose gross income does not exceed $75,000 ($150,000 for joint return filers). The amount of such rebates are $2,000 for each individual taxpayer ($4,000 for joint return filers) and $600 for each qualifying child of the taxpayer. The Internal Revenue Service may determine eligibility for the recovery rebate based on a taxpayer's 2019 tax return or other information if the taxpayer has not filed a return for 2019.\n\nTo be eligible for a recovery rebate, a taxpayer must provide a valid identification number (i.e., a Social Security account number). If only one spouse filing a joint return provides a valid identification number, the amount of the recovery rebate is reduced to $2,000. The bill provides a limited exemption from garnishment and other offsets for recovery rebates."
