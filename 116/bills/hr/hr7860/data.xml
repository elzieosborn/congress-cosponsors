This bill makes an exception to the prohibition on duplication of assistance during a major disaster or emergency for any person who is or may be entitled to receive nutrition assistance through a program administered by the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Thus, individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other USDA nutrition programs may also participate in feeding programs funded using Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) public assistance funds.</summary>
