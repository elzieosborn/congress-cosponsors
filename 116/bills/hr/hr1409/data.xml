This bill requires the health care industry to publicly disclose the prices of products and services. Specifically, the bill requires entities that offer or furnish health care related products or services to the public, including health insurers and government agencies, to disclose the price for those products and services at the point of purchase and on the internet. The entities must disclose all prices, including wholesale, retail, and discounted prices, that are accepted as payment in full for products and services furnished to individual consumers.

The Department of Health and Human Services may investigate and impose civil penalties on entities that fail to comply with this requirement.</summary>
