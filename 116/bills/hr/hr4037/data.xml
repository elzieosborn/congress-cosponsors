This bill addresses state licensure of independent insurance claims adjusters.

Specifically, the bill authorizes an independent insurance claims adjuster to apply to the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers for membership for the purpose of licensure in any state that requires a license for such adjusters and that does not have in effect, four years after this bill's enactment (1) uniform laws and regulations governing the licensure of individuals and entities within the state, and (2) reciprocity laws and regulations governing the licensure of nonresident individuals and entities.

Similarly, an independent crop insurance adjuster may meet the certification requirements of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation for licensure.

The bill also waives license renewal requirements for certain service members.</summary>
