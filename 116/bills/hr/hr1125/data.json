    "text": "Accountability for Quality VA Healthcare Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to address functionality and accountability in regard to its facilities and provision of care.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the VA to carry out a two-year pilot program to enhance the physical security of five selected VA medical facilities.\n\nThe VA must submit a report that includes its plan and time frame to address specified findings and recommendations of the Government Accountability Office report titled VA Real Property: VA Should Improve Its Efforts to Align Facilities with Veterans' Needs.\n\nThe bill requires the VA to update its Planning and Activating Community Based Outpatient Clinics handbook at least once every five years to reflect current policies and clarify the responsibilities of VA leasing project personnel.\n\nThe VA must strengthen its medical facility inspection process and monitor women veterans' access to gender-specific care services under community care contracts, including appointment scheduling and completion times.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the VA to (1) clarify measures for medical appointment wait times in a manner that reduces the likelihood of misinterpretation, (2) ensure that patient indicated date (the earliest date the patient needs to be seen) is clearly defined for purposes of Veterans Health Administration scheduling and related training documents, (3) improve recruitment and retention of scheduling staff and require facilities to routinely assess scheduling and resource needs, and (4) improve telephone access at its medical facilities."
