DOT must maintain a national pedestrian and bicycle safety database that includes (1) a list of high-risk intersections, roads, and highways with a documented history of pedestrian or bicycle accidents or fatalities and details regarding those incidents; and (2) information on corrective measures that have been implemented at the state, local, or federal level to enhance pedestrian and bicyclist safety at those high-risk areas, including details on the nature and date of corrective action."
