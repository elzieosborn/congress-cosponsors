This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a five-year program to provide grants to electric utilities to (1) improve the performance or efficiency of a power line, (2) make a power line more resilient to an extreme weather event, or (3) otherwise ensure that an end-user has access to electricity during an extreme weather event.

DOE must prioritize providing grants to electric utilities that sell electricity in an area that has a history of extreme weather events.</summary>
