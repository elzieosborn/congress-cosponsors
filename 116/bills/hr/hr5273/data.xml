This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to report to Congress a plan to perform high-throughput scanning of all commercial and passenger vehicles and freight rail traffic entering the United States at a land port of entry or rail-border crossing using large-scale non-intrusive inspection systems, such as X-ray and gamma-ray imaging systems, or similar technology. The plan shall include elements such as (1) an inventory of such systems currently in use, (2) the estimated costs of achieving a 100% scanning rate, and (3) the anticipated impact that increasing the scanning rate will have on wait times at land ports of entry and rail-border crossings. DHS shall periodically report to Congress on the progress in implementing the plan.</summary>
