This bill provides that an owner or operator of a social media service shall be treated as a publisher or speaker of user-generated content (and, therefore,&#160;may potentially be held liable with respect to such&#160;content)&#160;if&#160; the service or its algorithm&#160;does any of the following:

 displays user-generated content in an order that is not chronological; delays the display of such content relative to other content; or hinders the display of such&#160;content for reasons other than to carry out the user's direction or to restrict material that the provider or user considers obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.</summary>
