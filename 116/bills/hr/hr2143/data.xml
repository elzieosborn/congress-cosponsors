This bill expands&#160;Medicare's prohibition on physician self-referrals (i.e., the Stark law) to include, with specified exceptions,&#160;certain advanced imaging, anatomic pathology, radiation therapy, and physical therapy services. Additionally, the bill establishes increased civil monetary penalties for violations of the self-referral prohibition with respect to those services.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services shall conduct a&#160;compliance review&#160;with respect to such referrals.</summary>
