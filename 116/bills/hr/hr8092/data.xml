This bill establishes certain rules for the treatment of absentee ballots in federal elections.

Specifically, the bill requires states to allow an individual to (1) submit a request for an absentee ballot through the internet or mobile application and by telephone, and (2) cast their ballot by delivering it by mail or to a polling place or drop-off location.

Further, the bill prohibits states from refusing to accept or process an absentee ballot on the grounds that the individual did not meet a deadline for returning the ballot, if the ballot is (1) postmarked, signed, or otherwise indicated by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) that it was mailed on or before the date of the election; and (2) received by the appropriate election official prior to the expiration of the 10-day period beginning on the date of the election.

Finally, the Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on the USPS. The report must include (1) a review of the current level of staffing, funding, equipment, and other information related to the USPS; and (2) recommendations on how to improve the USPS to provide low-cost and efficient postal delivery services six days a week.</summary>
