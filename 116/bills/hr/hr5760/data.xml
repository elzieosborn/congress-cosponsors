This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop a program to protect the electric grid and energy systems from cyber and physical attacks by by increasing cyber and physical security capabilities of the energy sector and accelerating the development of relevant technologies and tools.

As part of the program, DOE must award research, development, and demonstration grants, including to (1) identify cybersecurity risks to information systems within, and impacting, the electricity sector, energy systems, and energy infrastructure; and (2) develop technologies that improve the physical security of information systems.

Additionally, DOE must

 establish a research, development, and demonstration competitive grant program to enhance resilience and strengthen emergency response and management pertaining to the energy sector; provide technical assistance to certain entities for the commercial application of technologies to improve the resilience of the electric grid and commercial application of technologies; collaborate with other federal agencies, state agencies, and the private sector to develop guidance for research and demonstration activities to improve cybersecurity capabilities of the energy sector; work with stakeholders to identify information, research, staff training, and analytical tools needed to evaluate cybersecurity issues and challenges in the energy sector; support the development of a cybersecurity workforce that includes collaboration between relevant federal agencies, institutions of higher education, and other entities best suited to provide national leadership on cybersecurity-related issues; develop a coordinated interagency strategic plan to advance cybersecurity capabilities in the energy sector; and implement a research and development program of technologies and tools to help ensure the resilience and security of critical integrated grid infrastructures.</summary>
