  <summary date="2019-11-27T20:25:11Z" status="Introduced in House">Protecting Communities from Liquefied Natural Gas Trains Act 

This bill directs the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to conduct an evaluation of the safety, security, and environmental risks of transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) by rail.

Among other things, the FRA must

 perform physical testing of rail tank cars, including ensuring such rail tank cars are able to withstand the effects of an accident or impact and prevent or mitigate the release of LNG; analyze multiple release scenarios, including derailments, front-end collisions, and rear-end collisions; and examine the effects of exposure to climate conditions across rail networks, including temperature, humidity, and other factors that may influence performance of the inner or outer walls of rail tank cars. The Government Accountability Office must conduct an independent evaluation to ensure all review requirements under this bill have been satisfactorily met.</summary>
