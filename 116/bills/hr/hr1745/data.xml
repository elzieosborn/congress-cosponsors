This bill adds two new categories of individuals who are prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm or ammunition. Specifically, these new categories are (1) individuals who are subject to a temporary court order that requires the removal of their firearms, and (2) individuals who were convicted of a misdemeanor crime of violence within the past five years.

In addition, the bill modifies certain statutory references, such as by replacing adjudicated a mental defective with adjudicated as ineligible due to disqualifying mental status.</summary>
