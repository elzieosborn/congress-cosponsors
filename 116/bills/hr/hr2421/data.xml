This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that receive federal aid to certify annually with the Department of Education that they have reviewed reports of misconduct by their employees involving domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The certification must include a confirmation that the IHEs' president and board members involved in the review did not interfere with or influence investigations or dispositions.</summary>
