  <summary date="2020-06-24T17:53:50Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits the General Services Administration (GSA), when determining the FY2021 and FY2022 per diem reimbursement rates for locations within the Continental United States (CONUS), from setting lodging allowances below the FY2020 levels.

 CONUS per diem reimbursement rates are the maximum allowances that federal employees are reimbursed for official travel expenses. The rates consist of lodging, meals, and incidental expense allowances; the GSA sets rates annually based on data from the prior 12-month period.</summary>
