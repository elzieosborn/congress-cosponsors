  <summary date="2021-06-09T13:43:20Z" status="Introduced in House">Compact Federal District Act

This bill cedes certain portions of the District of Columbia to Maryland while retaining particular portions of the District (the Federal District) under the exclusive legislative authority and control of Congress to serve as the permanent seat of the federal government. Maryland must accept this retrocession for it to take effect.

The Federal District shall consist of a designated geographic area and specified properties including, the principal federal monuments; the White House; the U.S. Capitol; the U.S. Supreme Court Building; the federal executive, legislative, and judicial office buildings located adjacent to the Mall and the U.S. Capitol; and the Frances Perkins Building, including any portion of it north of D Street NW. The bill also maintains the federal government's authority over military lands and specified other property.

In addition, the bill (1) applies current Maryland criminal laws and laws that regulate Maryland vehicular traffic to the Federal District, (2) continues pending judicial proceedings, and (3) repeals requirements providing for participation of the seat of the federal government in elections of the President and Vice President.

 The bill also temporarily continues certain federal authorities and responsibilities that pertain to the District of Columbia, including regarding employee benefits, agencies, courts, and college tuition assistance.</summary>
