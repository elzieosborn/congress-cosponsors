This bill establishes and makes deposits into the Biomedical Innovation Fund for initiatives at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advancing medical innovation, including by supporting (1) research for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment; (2) research for diseases that disproportionally account for federal health care spending; (3) the development, review, and post-market surveillance of medical products; (4) early-career scientists, including researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups; and (5) other innovative research.

The bill also requries annual reporting about the fund by the NIH, the FDA, and the Department of the Treasury.</summary>
