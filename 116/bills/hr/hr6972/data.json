States may use funds for specified items and activities, including testing kits, staffing, and facility development. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must issue related guidance that includes, among other things, which facilities are permitted to cohort individuals and strategies for effective implementation; such guidance must account for certain factors, including a facility's compliance with Medicare and Medicaid requirements regarding infection control and emergency preparedness.\n\nThe CMS must also provide monthly congressional briefings on the outbreak in these facilities and related agency actions."
