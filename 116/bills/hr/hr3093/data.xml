This bill modifies processes for the acquisition of software for the Department of Defense (DOD). It requires DOD to establish guidance for the use of pathways for the rapid acquisition of software applications and upgrades that are intended to be fielded within one year:

 An applications pathway shall provide for the use of rapid development and implementation of applications to be used with commercially available hardware. An upgrades pathway shall provide for the rapid development and insertion of software upgrades for hardware systems solely used by DOD. The bill requires DOD to establish software development and acquisition training and management programs enabling software personnel to earn a certification in software development and acquisition.</summary>
