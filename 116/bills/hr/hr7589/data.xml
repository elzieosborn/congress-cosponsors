  <summary date="2020-10-23T15:39:32Z" status="Introduced in House">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director and Assistant Directors Act

This bill establishes term limits and alters the personnel classification and appointment process for certain leadership positions in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security.

Specifically, the bill establishes a five-year term for the Director of CISA, limits service to two terms, and reclassifies the position to a higher rate of basic pay. The bill also requires the Assistant Director for Cybersecurity and the Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security to be appointed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, rather than by the President.</summary>
