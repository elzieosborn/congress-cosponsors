Specifically, the bill requires certain members of a reserve component who have previously served on active duty to be provided with both a physical examination and a mental health assessment prior to separation. Under current law, only a physical examination must be offered to such reservists, and the examination is optional.\n\nThe bill also specifies the time period during which the pre-separation physical examination and mental health assessment must occur. Specifically, a service member must undergo a physical examination and mental health assessment during the 90-day period before the service member's separation from the Armed Forces.\n\nIn addition, the bill requires pre-separation counseling to include a plan for a service member's achievement of health care objectives."
