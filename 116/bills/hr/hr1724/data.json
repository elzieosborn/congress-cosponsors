It also requires IHEs to designate a staff liaison to assist these students with support services, programs, and community resources in a variety of areas, including financial aid and housing.\n\nThe bill also requires these students to receive in-state tuition rates at public IHEs. Under current law, some states offer these students in-state tuition or provide them with tuition waivers."
