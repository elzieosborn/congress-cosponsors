This bill expands existing notice and publication requirements related to remedial action plans for Superfund sites (sites contaminated with hazardous substances).

Specifically, the bill requires the notice and analysis of a proposed plan to be transmitted to local government officials with jurisdiction over the facility at issue, including any mayor, city council, or the highest ranking official in the area. During the public comment period, written and oral comments may be submitted regarding the use of the facility at issue after the remedial action is taken.

Notice of the final remedial action plan must be transmitted to the local government officials with jurisdiction over the facility at issue.

Finally, the bill expands the minimum publication requirements for proposed and final plans to include an announcement via a radio or television station in the broadcast area surrounding the facility at issue. Additionally, any publications must be posted to the Environmental Protection Agency website.</summary>
