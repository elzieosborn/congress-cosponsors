This bill authorizes the Department of Transportation (DOT) to declare an aviation humanitarian crisis at airports serving areas in which a federally-declared major disaster or emergency exists. For each such humanitarian crisis, DOT must identify the airports subject to the disaster declaration and the time period during which the declaration applies.

The bill limits the ability of air carriers to impose an excess charge for any seat on a flight or a passenger facility charge during the period of such crisis.</summary>
