  <summary date="2019-12-02T22:57:19Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving Science in Chemical Assessments Act

This bill modifies procedures related to specified chemical assessments performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Specifically, chemical hazard identification and dose response assessments, currently performed by the Integrated Risk Information System program, must be performed by the appropriate EPA program office.

Additionally, the bill requires the EPA to establish a steering committee to ensure there is no duplication of effort by relevant program offices in conducting covered assessments.</summary>
