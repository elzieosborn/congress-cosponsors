    "text": "This bill modifies budget treatment for equity investments made by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.\n\nUnder current law, such equity investments are treated like grants for federal budgetary scoring, which requires the government to provide through appropriations the full amount that may be invested (i.e., dollar-for-dollar funding).\n\nThe bill instead deems such equity investments a federal credit program. As a result, such investments are scored based on an estimated repayment rate, and appropriation of the full investment amount is not required."
