Specifically, the institute may award these grants to state and local courts, nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and other specified entities. The policies and practices must incorporate guidance that courts should, among other things, prohibit the use of monetary bail schedules and consider alternatives to incarceration for defendants who are unable to pay fines and monetary bail."
