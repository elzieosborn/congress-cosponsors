The 504 Loan Program provides a small business with SBA financing\u2014through a CDC intermediary\u2014for expansion or modernization.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the office to oversee any CDC that participates in the program and to conduct file reviews with respect to loan closings under the program. Further, the bill authorizes the office to take formal and informal enforcement actions against a CDC for specified violations and to charge each CDC a fee.\n\nThe SBA must issue rules to clarify the procedures necessary for an eligible CDC to comply with certain environmental requirements."
