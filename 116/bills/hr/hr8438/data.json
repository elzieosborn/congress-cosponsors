(The President already has authority to impose such sanctions on certain aliens, such as senior leaders in the government of Belarus.)\n\nThe bill also expands authorized assistance related to Belarus to include assistance to (1) counter internet censorship and surveillance technology, (2) support the work of women advocating for freedom and human rights, and (3) support political refugees fleeing the crackdown in Belarus."
