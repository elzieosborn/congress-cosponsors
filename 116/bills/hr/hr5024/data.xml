  <summary date="2020-08-17T13:54:02Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands eligibility for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital care and medical services to recently discharged or released veterans during the one-year period following their discharge or release from active service or active reserve status. Such veterans shall be eligible for care even if they fail to enroll in the VA health care system.

The Department of Labor must promote the expanded eligibility for such VA care to members of the Armed Forces transitioning from service in the Armed Forces to civilian life through the Transition Assistance Program. In addition, the VA must publish notification of the expanded eligibility for such care on a VA website.</summary>
