  <summary date="2021-02-09T02:24:38Z" status="Introduced in House">Civil Justice for Victims of China-Originated Viral Infections Diseases Act or the Civil Justice for Victims of COVID Act 

 This bill allows a foreign government to be sued in U.S. district court regarding&#160;that government's actions related to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak.

A foreign government shall not have sovereign immunity against a lawsuit in the United States seeking money damages for physical or economic injury occurring in the United States following any reckless action or omission of that foreign government (or any official or agent of that government) that caused or substantially contributed to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

If the United States is in discussions with a foreign state seeking to resolve claims related to COVID-19 against that foreign state, a court may stay a pending case brought under this bill against that foreign state.</summary>
