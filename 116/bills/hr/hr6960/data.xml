This bill reserves assistance under the Paycheck Protection Program, established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), for specified small entities.

Specifically, the bill establishes a set-aside of at least 25% of amounts appropriated for paycheck protection loans to guarantee loans of $150,000 or less made to small entities such as a (1) business or nonprofit with 25 employees or fewer, (2) sole proprietor, or (3) self-employed individual.

The Small Business Administration must consider implementing a similar set-aside for any future loan programs created in direct response to a major disaster.</summary>
