  <summary date="2020-11-10T17:14:40Z" status="Introduced in House">Strictly Pay for Efficient and Expedited Delivery of Your COVID-19 Tests Act or the SPEEDY COVID-19 Tests Act

This bill establishes and otherwise modifies requirements relating to Medicare payments for specified laboratory diagnostic tests during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

In particular, the bill requires laboratories, as a condition of Medicare participation, to furnish COVID-19 test results to health care providers within 28 days of when the test was ordered. The bill also adjusts payments based on how quickly laboratories return test results. For example, the bill increases payments for laboratories that return test results within 24 hours, but prohibits payment for results that take 72 hours or longer.</summary>
