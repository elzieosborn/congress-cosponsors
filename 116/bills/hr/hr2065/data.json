    "text": "Affordable Loans for Any Student Act\n\nThis bill addresses repayment options, loan disclosures, and loan counseling for student loans.\n\nThe bill revises requirements concerning repayment options for student loan borrowers. For instance, the bill terminates interest capitalization and origination fees for Federal Direct Loans, provides assistance to low-income borrowers or borrowers who are delinquent on loan payments, and replaces the existing income-based repayment plans with two new plans. Under the new plans, borrowers may choose (1) a fixed repayment plan with equal monthly payments paid over a period of 10 years, or (2) an income-based repayment plan with monthly payments equal to 10% percent of their income above the poverty level. The income-based plan is capped at 20 years of payments.\n\nThe bill also revises requirements concerning student loan disclosures and student loan counseling for borrowers. For instance, the bill requires the Department of Education to maintain online counseling tools that provide borrowers with annual and exit student loan counseling."
