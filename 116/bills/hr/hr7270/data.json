Further, the bill requires each specified federal agency to provide Congress with a similar list of all criminal regulatory offenses that are enforced by the agency.\n\n Finally, the bill requires DOJ and each specified federal agency to establish a publicly accessible index of the crimes that are reported to Congress."
