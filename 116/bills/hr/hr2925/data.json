The entity must subsequently apply for a warrant within seven days, and if a warrant is not granted, the seized information must be destroyed and may not be disclosed.\n\nA governmental entity may not make or retain a copy of information accessed under this bill without probable cause to believe that such information relates to a crime.\n\nInformation seized in violation of this bill (1) must be destroyed, (2) may not be disclosed, and (3) may not be received in evidence in any trial or government proceeding.\n\nA governmental entity shall keep a record of each instance in which it obtains access to an individual's digital information at the border."
