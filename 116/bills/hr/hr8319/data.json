The bill also includes provisions that\n\n increase and expand U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services fees for providing premium processing services for certain immigration-related applications, and reauthorize a program that provides incentives (e.g., limitations on civil liability) for corporations to self-report antitrust violations to the Department of Justice."
