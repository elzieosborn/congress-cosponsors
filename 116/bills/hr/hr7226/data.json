When the commission is considering whether to recommend continuing, abolishing, or reorganizing an agency or advisory committee, the agency shall submit timely responses to a questionnaire provided by the commission, which shall include\n\n an explanation of why the functions of the agency or advisory committee continue to be necessary, what efficiencies taxpayers realize by the continued operation of the agency or advisory committee, and why the responsibilities of the agency or advisory committee cannot be better performed by the private sector or another agency or committee. Legislation proposed by the commission shall be granted expedited consideration."
