This bill extends for an additional six months the Small Business Debt Relief Program, under which the Small Business Administration (SBA), in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), was authorized to subsidize six months of payments for certain SBA-backed loan products on behalf of the recipients of these loans. Further, a small business that submits a new application for an SBA-backed loan prior to March 30, 2021, may receive a six month subsidy.</summary>
