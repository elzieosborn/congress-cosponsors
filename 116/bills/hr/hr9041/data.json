Specifically, the bill provides that any national emergency declared by the President shall terminate if (1) no joint resolution has been enacted affirming the declaration of such emergency before the expiration of the 48-hour period beginning on the first day after such emergency is declared and on which both houses of Congress are in session, (2) a joint resolution is enacted terminating the emergency, or (3) the President issues a proclamation terminating the emergency.\n\nThe date on which a presidentially-declared emergency terminates is 60 days after the President transmits to Congress the proclamation declaring the emergency or Congress affirms a previous renewal unless the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to Congress an executive order renewing the emergency, and a joint resolution is enacted affirming the renewal of the declaration.\n\nA national emergency declared before the enactment of this bill shall be unaffected by the amendments made by this bill except that such emergencies shall terminate 60 days after enactment unless renewed."
