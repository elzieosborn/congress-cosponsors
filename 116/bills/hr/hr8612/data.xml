  <summary date="2020-12-31T17:31:24Z" status="Introduced in House">Enhancing K-12 Cybersecurity Act

This bill establishes resources and a grant program to address cyberattacks on elementary and secondary schools.

First, the bill directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to establish an online clearinghouse to disseminate information, best practices, and grant opportunities to improve cybersecurity in elementary and secondary schools.

In addition, CISA must establish a registry to track incidents of cyberattacks on schools. Schools may voluntarily submit information to the registry.

Finally, the bill requires the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure within the National Science Foundation to make grants to schools and educational agencies to address cybersecurity threats by expanding workforce capacity and improving cyberinfrastructure.</summary>
