Schools may voluntarily submit information to the registry.\n\nFinally, the bill requires the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure within the National Science Foundation to make grants to schools and educational agencies to address cybersecurity threats by expanding workforce capacity and improving cyberinfrastructure."
