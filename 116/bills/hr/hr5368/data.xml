This bill directs the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), upon the written request of the Department of Education, to disclose to any authorized person, tax return information to determine eligibility for&#160;recertifications for income-contingent or income-based repayments, discharges of loans based on total and permanent disability, and the amount of student financial aid.

The IRS must also establish and implement procedures for recertifying income for purposes of this bill and for requesting tax return information.</summary>
