This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to get a medical opinion to determine if a service-connected disability was the principal or contributory cause of death in situations where the death certificate of a veteran with a service-connected disability who has filed a claim for dependency and indemnity compensation (1) identifies COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) as the principal or contributory cause of death, and (2) does not clearly identify the service-connected disability as the principal or contributory cause of death.</summary>
