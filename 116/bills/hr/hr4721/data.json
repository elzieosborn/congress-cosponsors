(Russia was disinvited from the Group of Eight in 2014 after it occupied parts of Ukraine, including the Crimea region.)\n\nThis prohibition shall terminate after the Department of State certifies that Russia (1) has halted all interference into U.S. elections; (2) has ended its occupation of Crimea and is implementing its commitments under certain agreements related to Ukraine; and (3) has\u00a0taken steps to end its campaign to divide western economic, political, and security institutions."
