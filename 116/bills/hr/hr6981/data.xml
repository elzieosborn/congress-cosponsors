This bill modifies the Paycheck Protection Program established to support small businesses in response to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) by (1) extending from 8 weeks to 16 weeks the period during which a loan recipient must use their paycheck protection loan to be eligible for forgiveness; and (2) allowing a recipient 16 weeks from the date of the loan to eliminate a reduction in workforce, salary, or wages that would otherwise reduce their forgivable amount.</summary>
