  <summary date="2021-04-20T20:39:01Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthening State and Local Cybersecurity Defenses Act

This bill provides for collaboration between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as corporations, associations, and the general public, regarding cybersecurity.

The bill expands DHS responsibilities through grants and cooperative agreements, including provision of assistance and education related to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures and cybersecurity technologies, cybersecurity risks, incidents, analysis, and warnings.

The bill requires the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to coordinate with entities such as the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center to, among other things (1) conduct exercises, (2) provide operational and technical cybersecurity training, (3) provide federal and non-federal entities timely notifications containing specific incident and malware information, and (4) promote cybersecurity education and awareness.</summary>
