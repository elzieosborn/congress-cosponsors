This bill limits, under certain conditions, a business's liability under federal law for death or disability related to COVID-19 (i.e. coronavirus disease 2019) and promotes alternative dispute resolution mechanisms with respect to such liability.

Specifically, the bill establishes the COVID-19 Response Commission to make recommendations to mitigate the spread of the disease. An individual may not sue a business that follows a national or state guideline aligned with these recommendations unless the individual notifies the business of practices that placed the individual at risk of contracting COVID-19 and the business failed to remedy those practices. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in consultation with the commission, must also provide education for state and local governments and businesses on strategies to minimize exposure to COVID-19.

In addition, the Judicial Conference of the United States must develop an alternative dispute resolution program to resolve federal COVID-19 liability claims, and the Small Business Administration, when awarding certain general business loans, must give priority to states that enact similar laws to limit liability and promote alternative dispute resolution.</summary>
