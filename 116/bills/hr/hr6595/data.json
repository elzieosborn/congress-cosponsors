The State Department must also waive or reimburse certain repatriation travel expenses incurred due to COVID-19.\n\nFurther, the State Department must\n\n provide U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic missions with explicit guidance to protect American lives abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic, increase certain consular affairs staffing, develop a comprehensive plan for COVID-19 infection risk mitigation procedures for all persons under chief of mission authority at overseas posts, regularly report on the Bureau of Consular Affairs' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and prioritize regular and continued hiring of Foreign Service officers and specialists."
