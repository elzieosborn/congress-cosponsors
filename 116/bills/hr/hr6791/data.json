An interior inspection may be waived if (1) an exterior inspection is performed in conjunction with certain contemporaneous verifications, such as video or photographs by the borrower; (2) an interior inspection may be ordered at a later date; and (3) an appraiser rejected the assignment due to health and safety concerns."
