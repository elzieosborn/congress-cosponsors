Until the end of the emergency period, issuers receiving aid must maintain preemergency workforce and compensation levels. Additionally, an issuer receiving aid may not provide executive bonuses, purchase its own company's stocks, pay out dividends to stockholders, or engage in lobbying until the issuer repays the aid.\n\nCertain issuers receiving aid must (1) have one-third of their board of directors be elected by employees; and (2) provide additional disclosures including those regarding political expenditures, workforce composition, employee benefits, environmental impacts, federal aid, and financial performance."
