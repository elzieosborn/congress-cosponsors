  <summary date="2020-06-03T15:58:33Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes requirements for issuers of securities receiving aid in response to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency.

Issuers receiving aid must comply with specified requirements regarding paid leave, minimum wage, and limits on executive compensation. Until the end of the emergency period, issuers receiving aid must maintain preemergency workforce and compensation levels. Additionally, an issuer receiving aid may not provide executive bonuses, purchase its own company's stocks, pay out dividends to stockholders, or engage in lobbying until the issuer repays the aid.

Certain issuers receiving aid must (1) have one-third of their board of directors be elected by employees; and (2) provide additional disclosures including those regarding political expenditures, workforce composition, employee benefits, environmental impacts, federal aid, and financial performance.</summary>
