This bill requires covered veterans to submit a notification of the care or services they received within 30 days of being admitted for emergency care under the Veterans Community Care Program as a condition for authorization of such care by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Covered veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health care system or those who are not enrolled but are eligible for care due to a service-connected disability.</summary>
