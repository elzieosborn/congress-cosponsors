In addition, HHS shall not require any organization to refer a beneficiary who objects to the religious character of that organization to an alternative provider. States and local governments that administer HHS funds must adhere to these requirements, as well.\n\nUnder current law, these restrictions apply to HHS financial assistance and programs through an executive order concerning the administration of federal grants and programs related to faith-based organizations."
