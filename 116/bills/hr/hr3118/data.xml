  <summary date="2022-04-14T16:45:03Z" status="Introduced in House">Clean Up Congress Act

This bill (1) revises the post-employment lobbying ban on former Members of Congress, (2) prohibits the use of federal funds for certain official travel expenses of Members, and (3) prohibits automatic pay adjustments for Members during any year following a budget deficit.

Specifically, this bill imposes a permanent ban on lobbying contacts by a former Member of the Senate (currently, a two-year ban), or a former Member of the House of Representatives (currently, a one-year ban). The bill maintains the current one-year ban on elected officers of the House.

In addition, the bill (1) prohibits the use of federal funds for official travel expenses of a Member for airline accommodations that are not coach-class accommodations, and (2) prohibits an automatic adjustment to the pay of Members if the Congressional Budget Office determines that there was a federal budget deficit in the last fiscal year.</summary>
