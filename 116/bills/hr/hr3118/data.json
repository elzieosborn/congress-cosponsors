The bill maintains the current one-year ban on elected officers of the House.\n\nIn addition, the bill (1) prohibits the use of federal funds for official travel expenses of a Member for airline accommodations that are not coach-class accommodations, and (2) prohibits an automatic adjustment to the pay of Members if the Congressional Budget Office determines that there was a federal budget deficit in the last fiscal year."
