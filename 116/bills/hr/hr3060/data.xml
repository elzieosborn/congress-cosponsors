  <summary date="2019-12-18T21:45:50Z" status="Introduced in House">FEMA Modernization Act of 2019

This bill revamps, modifies, and revises the organization, activities, and processes of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Among other things, it requires FEMA to divide its Office of Response and Recovery into an Office of Disaster Response and an Office of Disaster Recovery, and to report on its ability to support a state managed and locally executed casework management system to coordinate and deliver direct assistance to disaster survivors.

Disaster Recovery Small Business Grant Act

The bill establishes within the Small Business Administration an Office of Disaster Recovery Small Business Grants. It also reauthorizes through FY2029 the temporary reassignment of state and local personnel during a public health emergency.</summary>
