As part of this program, USDA may restructure existing housing loans by, for example, reducing or eliminating interest and deferring loan payments.\n\nFurther, USDA must annually provide, to owners of properties with loans that will mature within four years, written notice explaining the options to restructure such loans. USDA must also provide, to households in properties with loans that will mature within two years, written notice of actions that may happen upon the loan's maturity and information on how to protect their right to reside in federally assisted housing.\n\nAdditionally, USDA may provide technical assistance grants to qualified nonprofit organizations and public housing agencies to help borrowers acquire multifamily rental-housing properties in areas where there is a risk of loss of affordable housing.\n\nFurther, USDA may provide rural housing vouchers for low-income households (including those not receiving rental assistance) residing in certain properties financed with or insured by USDA loans.\n\nUSDA must also establish an advisory committee to assist in preserving such properties and implementing a specified plan to preserve their affordability for low-income families.\n\nThe bill also extends existing housing protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking to victims who receive housing voucher assistance. (These protections include a protection against eviction on the basis of being a victim of domestic violence.)"
