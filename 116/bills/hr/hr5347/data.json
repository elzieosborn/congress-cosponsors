Under the program, Interior must provide grants to assist communities that have experienced a significant decline in quantity or quality of drinking water in obtaining or maintaining adequate quantities of water that meet drinking water quality standards. Specifically, grants must be provided to communities that are unable to meet primary drinking water quality standards or to communities with water supplies that have been lost or severely diminished due to drought conditions, groundwater overdraft conditions, or climate change conditions. Grants must benefit communities with a median household income below a certain threshold located in a city, town, or special district with a population of no more than 60,000 residents."
