    "text": "Focusing Attention on Safety Transparency and Effective Recalls Act or the FASTER Act This bill provides statutory authority for the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s (CPSC) fast-track recall program, which is a process for expediting removal of substantially hazardous products from the marketplace. Specifically, if a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer submits notification that it intends to carry out a fast-track recall plan, the CPSC must promptly post the notice on its website. The fast-track recall plan submitted to the CPSC must include (1) a clear product description, (2) a clear description of the safety risk being addressed, (3) how a consumer can obtain the available remedy, (4) a statement that such remedy will be provided at no charge, (5) the earliest date such remedy will be available, and (6) a schedule for notifying entities in the supply chain of the recall plan. For the purpose of related CPSC proceedings, however, filing a fast-track plan does not constitute an admission that the product is actually defective or presents a substantial hazard. Further, if the CPSC determines, after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that the remedy in the submitted fast-track plan is inadequate, it may order the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer to take additional actions, including ceasing distribution, notification by mail, replacing the defective product, and accelerating the remedy."
