This bill requires Members of Congress to reimburse the Treasury for amounts paid on their behalf as settlements and awards in all instances of employment discrimination acts by any Member, and it requires the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights to conduct an independent investigation for an allegation of harassment or discrimination.

Under current law, a Member is only required to make reimbursement for instances of harassment (not discrimination), and the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights is required to notify an employee who filed a claim alleging harassment about the process and deadlines for mediation.</summary>
