This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to increase the annual cap on permits for alien workers entering the Northern Mariana Islands to work in the construction and extraction occupations. Specifically, DHS shall increase the cap by 3,000 permits each year for FY2020, FY2021, and FY2022. These permits may only be issued to alien workers from designated countries who are performing work associated with recovery from, or preparation for, a disaster or emergency. Various existing limitations on permits for such occupations shall not apply during these years.</summary>
