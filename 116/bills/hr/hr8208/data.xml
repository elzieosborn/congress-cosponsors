This bill extends federal recognition to the Mono Lake Kutzadika&amp;#7491 Tribe.

The bill makes the tribe and its members eligible for services and benefits provided to federally recognized tribes and their members, without regard to the existence of a reservation or the location of the residence of any member. The service area of the tribe is considered to be Mono and Inyo counties, California.

In addition, the bill grants the tribe hunting and fishing rights on all federal lands within its aboriginal land area.

Further, the tribe must submit a membership roll to the Department of the Interior as a condition of receiving recognition, services, and benefits. The tribe must maintain the membership roll.

Interior, upon the request of the tribe, must take into trust certain land in Mono County, California, for the benefit of the tribe.</summary>
