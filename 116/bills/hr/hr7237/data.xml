This bill requires the Department of Energy to establish an Office of Advanced Clean Energy Technologies to manage a network of Regional Energy Innovation and Development Institutes (REIDIs) that accelerate clean energy innovation in the post-research stage. The term REIDIs means partnerships between governments, academic institutions, businesses, DOE national laboratories, and other clean energy entities that advance the development of early-stage innovations and support after proof concept to help clean energy innovations reach viability for commercial demonstration and deployment.</summary>
