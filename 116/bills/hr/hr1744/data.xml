This bill adds energy storage systems to the list of strategies states should consider when developing energy plans and using their utility ratemaking authority.

States must consider requiring that, as a part of a supply side resource planning process, electric utilities in the states demonstrate that they considered an investment in energy storage systems based on factors such as cost, improved reliability, security, and system performance and efficiency.

 The Department of Energy (DOE) must coordinate efforts among various existing programs conducting energy storage research at DOE.</summary>
