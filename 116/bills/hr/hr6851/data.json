Such grant (1) shall be a grant of whole shares of stock; (2) may not be conditioned on the purchase of company stock or any employee performance evaluations; and (3) shall be equal, in terms of voting and dividend rights, to the class of securities otherwise issued by the corporation that carries the highest such rights."
