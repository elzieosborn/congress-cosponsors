This bill requires federal law enforcement officers to report information about the injury or death of an individual occurring while in an officer's custody, control, or course of duty to the Department of Justice within 24 hours. Officers who either fail to submit such a report or submit a report containing false or misleading information are subject to criminal penalties.

The bill also reduces certain federal grants to state and local governments that do not require similar reporting by nonfederal law enforcement officers.</summary>
