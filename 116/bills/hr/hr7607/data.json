The bill also provides for exceptions to this requirement, such as for individuals who are under the age of two and those who need assistance removing face coverings.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Health and Human Services may award grants to states, tribes, and territories to promote access to face coverings, including by installing face covering dispensers in public places."
