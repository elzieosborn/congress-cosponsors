  <summary date="2019-12-17T21:48:42Z" status="Introduced in House">U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Act of 2019

This bill calls for various reports to Congress on China-related topics and revises labeling requirements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938.

Various agencies shall report on

 whether the United States should file a complaint with the World Trade Organization against China and on China's trade-distorting practices; efforts to prosecute Chinese Communist Party (CCP) affiliates who threaten or coerce U.S. residents; Chinese bases in other countries and how such bases affect freedom of navigation, sea control, and U.S. interests; the Chinese Coast Guard and whether it is being used as a coercive tool in the East China Sea and South China Sea; steps to ensure deployment of fifth generation mobile networks (5G networks) and the threats posed by Chinese 5G equipment and services; U.S.-China technical cooperation and related threats such as intellectual property theft; and China's enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. The bill also calls for annual reports on

 supply chain risks associated with China, in particular involving communications and mobile technologies and equipment; and CCP influence and propaganda activities in the United States. The bill also establishes that informational materials that must be labeled as distributed by a foreign principal shall be labeled as such on the first page in the languages used in the document.</summary>
