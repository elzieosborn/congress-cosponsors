This bill requires the Sergeants at Arms of the House of Representatives and the Senate to develop an interagency plan to assess whether employees of either chamber have connections to, and intend to engage in unlawful activity to the advantage of, the Chinese Communist Party. If an individual meets both of these criteria, the employing office for the individual must terminate their employment and refer them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for appropriate investigation.</summary>
