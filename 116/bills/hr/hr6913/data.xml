  <summary date="2020-06-16T14:23:11Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires a federal executive agency to expend 50% of funds obligated by such agency for the advertising and underwriting activities of local media for the period beginning on the enactment of this bill, and ending on December 31, 2020. It also requires such agencies to expend 25% of such funds for the period beginning on or after January 1, 2021. At least 45% of agency advertising and underwriting activities funding must be expended equally between newspapers, television stations, and radio stations that are local media.

The bill (1) expands the payroll protection program to newspaper, radio, and Internet publishing businesses with not more than 500 employees; (2) allows a payroll tax credit for 30% of first-year newsroom wages paid by a local media company; and (3) treats the publication (including electronic publication) of written news articles by an independent or community-based publication as a tax-exempt purpose.

The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting must provide programming to preschool, elementary, and secondary school children that promotes digital literacy during the period that such children cannot attend school due to the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.</summary>
