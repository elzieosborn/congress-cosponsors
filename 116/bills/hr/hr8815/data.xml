This bill establishes certain requirements for delivered ballots in federal elections.

Specifically, the bill requires a ballot submitted by mail or otherwise delivered in a federal election, in order to be counted, to (1) include the signature of the voter, and (2) be received by the appropriate election official by the date of the election.

Further, the bill requires a ballot that is delivered by a third party on behalf of a voter to include the signature of the third party. It also restricts the types of individuals who can deliver such a ballot to certain family members of the voter.

The bill excludes absent uniformed service members and their family members from these requirements.</summary>
