  <summary date="2019-04-23T18:17:19Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to implement a program to ensure that certain disclosures of tax returns or return information for third-party income verification are (1) fully automated and accomplished through the Internet, and (2) accomplished in as close to real-time as is practicable.

The requirement applies to IRS disclosures of returns or return information to a person verifying the income or creditworthiness of a taxpayer who is a borrower in the process of a loan application.

In implementing the program, the IRS must (1) ensure that the program complies with applicable security standards and guidelines; and (2) assess and collect a fee for the disclosures at rates that are sufficient to cover the costs related to implementing the program, including the costs of necessary infrastructure or technology.</summary>
