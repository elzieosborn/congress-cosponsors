    "text": "Humanitarian Upgrades to Manage and Assist our Nation's Enforcement Act of 2019 or the HUMANE Act of 2019\n\nThis bill modifies requirements relating to the detention of alien children and families, asylum seekers, and other immigration-related provisions.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall house detained alien children with a parent during the pendency of any civil or criminal proceedings if the children are accompanied by a parent. DHS shall ensure the facilities meet various standards, including those relating to accommodations and medical treatment.\n\nDHS shall expedite removal proceedings against alien children convicted of certain crimes.\n\nThe bill also imposes requirements on placing unaccompanied alien children with a nongovernmental sponsor, such as requiring the sponsor to be the child's parent or legal guardian and legally present in the United States. The Department of Health of Human Services may make exceptions in certain instances, such as when a child is believed to be a human trafficking victim, and place such a child with another relative.\n\nThe bill requires asylum applicants to arrive in the United States only at a designated port of arrival, where current law allows aliens to seek asylum whether or not they arrive at a designated port.\n\nDHS shall establish at least four regional processing centers to house and process detained aliens. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shall increase staffing, including field operations officers, support personnel, and attorneys.\n\nAliens who overstay a nonimmigrant visa or under a visa waiver program more than 30 days shall be subject to detention and removal, and barred from obtaining various immigration benefits."
