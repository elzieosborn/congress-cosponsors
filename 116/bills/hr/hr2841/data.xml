This bill imposes certain requirements on Chinese telecommunications, software, and electronics companies that were denied export privileges on or after a certain date.

Such a company shall be eligible for export privileges only if it certifies to the Department of Justice that it will (1) abide by all U.S. laws, (2) not engage in cyber espionage, and (3) not infringe intellectual property. To obtain export privilege eligibility, the company shall also establish with the Department of the Treasury a $2.5 billion account to pay any patent infringement judgments against it.

An entity seeking a preliminary injunction against such a company in an infringement lawsuit shall not be required to establish that irreparable harm would result if the injunction is not granted.</summary>
