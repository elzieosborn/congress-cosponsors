  <summary date="2020-04-20T13:50:57Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill allows taxpayers to claim a tax deduction for charitable contributions even if they do not otherwise itemize their deductions.

The bill also directs the Department of the Treasury to make or guarantee loans to tax-exempt charitable organizations. The aggregate amount of such loans may not exceed $60 billion. Treasury must give priority in making such loans to organizations that are providing direct assistance to the COVID-19 (i.e., the coronavirus disease 2019) response effort.</summary>
