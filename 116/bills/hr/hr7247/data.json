Under the program, DOE must maximize energy production and efficiency. In addition, DOE must develop energy systems involving the integration of nuclear energy with renewable energy, fossil energy, and energy storage. Finally, DOE must expand the use of emissions-reducing energy technologies into nonelectric sectors to achieve significant reductions in environmental emissions."
