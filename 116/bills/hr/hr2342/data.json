An executive agency may except an offeror from such requirements under specified circumstances, such as where (1) the products needed for the contract are not manufactured in the United States in sufficient quantities and are not of satisfactory quality, or (2) the use of such products would be inconsistent with the public interest.\n\nIf an agency determines that a contractor has submitted a false statement or violated any of the certification requirements, it shall terminate the contract and the contractor may not receive the preference for at least five years.\n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to implement the requirements of this bill."
