This bill establishes a particular Medicare payment methodology for telehealth services furnished by federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics during the public health emergency relating to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Specifically, the bill requires payments to be made in accordance with the same methodology that is used for non-telehealth services, rather than in accordance with a separate methodology determined by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</summary>
