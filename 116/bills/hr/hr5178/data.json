In addition, congressional budget resolutions for even-numbered fiscal years must either (1) instruct one or more congressional committees to recommend changes in existing laws necessary to achieve the target ratio, or (2) request the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on Fiscal Responsibility to make the recommendations.\n\nThe bill also sets forth requirements for (1) establishing the Joint Select Committee on Fiscal Responsibility if it is requested, and (2) considering the recommendations of the joint committee or other congressional committees using expedited legislative procedures in the Senate."
