This bill requires reporting of certain communications between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Executive Office of the President.

Specifically, the bill requires the Counsel to the President and DOJ to each maintain a log of any communication between an officer or employee of DOJ and an officer or employee of the Executive Office of the President that relates to an ongoing DOJ civil or criminal investigation. For each communication, the log must identify the participants, topic, and purpose.

Additionally, DOJ must submit semiannual reports to Congress, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) containing the communications log for the previous six-month period. DOJ must exclude from the report to Congress any record of a communication in which certain officials participated (e.g., President and Vice President).

The OIG and the OPR must review the log and notify Congress of inappropriate or improper communications.</summary>
