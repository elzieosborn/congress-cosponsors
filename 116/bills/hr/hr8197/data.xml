 This bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report on whether certain disclosures by an issuer of securities organized under the laws of China are necessary or appropriate under investor protection and fair dealing requirements. Specifically, the SEC must report on the necessity of disclosures by these issuers regarding their material financial support for certain Chinese policies or plans, material financial support received from China, and certain individuals' involvement with the Chinese government.
