If a violation is found, the President must impose appropriate penalties. Chinese subsidiaries of foreign companies are excluded from the bill.\n\nThe bill also prohibits executive agencies from reducing any penalty imposed on a Chinese telecommunications company for violating a sanction or export control, unless the President certifies that the company has not violated U.S. law for at least one year and is fully cooperating with investigations."
