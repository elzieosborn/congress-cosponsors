  <summary date="2020-11-28T00:44:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving COVID-19 Data Transparency Act

This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take certain actions with respect to reporting and modeling COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) data. It also requires health information technology, as a condition of certification by HHS, to automatically generate and transmit reports of possible reportable conditions from electronic health records to public health agencies.

The CDC must standardize the reporting of COVID-19 data by governmental health departments, including information related to contact tracing and surveillance, hospital admissions and outcomes, outbreaks, and community compliance with preventive measures. The CDC must also post and periodically update this information on its website.

In addition, the CDC must provide sufficient information about federal COVID-19 models to allow them to be reproduced, and HHS must enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study issues related to COVID-19 modeling, including the data sources used in the models.

The CDC must also deliver a weekly televised presentation that is open to the media on its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a publication that reports surveillance statistics and other public health information and recommendations.</summary>
