A transportation network company (TNC) is an entity that uses a digital network to connect riders to drivers affiliated with the entity to transport the rider using a vehicle owned, leased, or otherwise authorized for use by the driver to a point chosen by the rider.\n\nEach TNC must establish and implement a system and policy within its platform to make available to each passenger a digital method to verify that the driver with whom the passenger has been matched through the platform has been authorized by the TNC to accept the passenger's trip request prior to the beginning of the trip.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) must establish the Safety Actions for Matching and Identifying Ride Share Customers' Council (SAMI'S Law Council) that is an advisory council for developing recommended performance standards for successor technology that will protect TNC passengers and drivers.\n\nThe bill prohibits the sale of any signage that is designed to help a passenger identify a TNC vehicle and contains a TNC's proprietary trademark or logo, or purports to be that of a TNC, unless the sale is authorized by the TNC.\n\nDOT may issue penalties to a TNC for noncompliance with this bill, including up to $20,000 each day when such noncompliance is knowing and willful.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must conduct a study on the incidence of assault and abuse perpetrated on drivers by passengers of TNC vehicles and on such passengers by drivers of TNC vehicles."
