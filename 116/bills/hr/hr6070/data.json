Both the commission and the\u00a0council must develop strategic plans, work plans, evaluations, and reports concerning their activities.\n\nHHS must award grants to\u00a0(1) eligible entities in border areas to address recommendations of the commission and the council to improve the health of border area residents; and (2) trauma centers, public health entities, and state, local, or tribal entities for infectious disease surveillance activities in border areas. In addition, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response may coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security in establishing a system that alerts clinicians and public health officials to emerging health threats in border areas.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must evaluate commission and council activities every two years."
