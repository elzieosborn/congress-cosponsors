This bill requires an employer to be scored on worker-friendliness before entering into a federal contract and establishes a contracting preference for such score.

Specifically, each executive agency shall ensure that (1) contracting officers consider the score at least approximately equal in importance to cost or price, and (2) an offeror for a prime contract does not subcontract with any entity that violates specified labor laws and executive orders.

The Department of Labor, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, shall, among other things

 develop a method to score the worker-friendliness of each prospective contractor or subcontractor that submits a bid for a federal contract that takes into account specified factors, such as whether the employer provides paid overtime for any work that exceeds 40 hours per work week; provide each executive agency with recommendations on how to evaluate such a score in making contracting decisions; identify best practices for the implementation of the scoring process; create a process for an employer to appeal a score; review each score every five years to ensure that such score is up-to-date; and enable employers that are not federal contractors to request such a score for purposes of promoting worker-friendly policies.</summary>
