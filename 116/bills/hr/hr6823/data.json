Such vouchers may be used to rent an eligible housing unit under the existing program or to rent other types of housing, including recreation vehicles, hotel or motel rooms, and short-term rental units. Further, the bill waives certain requirements for receiving such assistance, such as requirements related to income verification and lease duration.\n\nThe bill also authorizes additional incremental vouchers under the existing housing choice voucher program."
