This bill requires, as a condition of receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health, entities that carry out animal-based research to establish adoption policies for dogs, cats, and rabbits when they are no longer used for research. It also limits, under certain conditions, an entity's liability related to these adoptions.</summary>
