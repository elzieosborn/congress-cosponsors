    "text": "This bill sets forth policies and procedures related to medical care for veterans covered under the Veterans Community Care Program and Veterans Care Agreements during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period.\n\nSpecifically, the bill authorizes covered veterans to receive care for COVID-19 diagnosis or treatment under the Veterans Community Care Program and Veterans Care Agreements during the COVID-19 emergency period, regardless of whether such care is for a service-connected disability. Emergency medical care and COVID-19 care shall not require Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) preauthorization during the emergency period.\n\nThe bill prescribes how the VA shall administer claims for payments relating to emergency COVID-19 care, depending on whether the community care provider is (1) an eligible provider under the Veterans Community Care Program, (2) party to a Veterans Care Agreement, or (3) not eligible under the Veterans Community Care Program or part of a Veterans Care Agreement.\n\nThe bill classifies emergency treatment for COVID-19 as emergency treatment eligible for coverage by the VA.\n\nThe VA shall determine whether a veteran who receives emergency care for COVID-19 is an active VA health care participant without regard to whether the veteran has received VA medical care in the two years preceding such emergency care.\n\nFinally, the bill specifies that, during the emergency period, community care providers that furnish emergency COVID-19 care are required to submit a claim for payment to the VA within 180 days of such care."
