  <summary date="2021-02-09T17:12:36Z" status="Introduced in House">A Just Society: A Place to Prosper Act of 2019

This bill addresses housing affordability, access, security, and safety.

For example, the bill specifies that landlords that own more than five residential properties or more than two manufactured housing parks (1) may not raise rent by more than a certain percentage; (2) may evict tenants only for specified reasons, such as for missing rent for two or more consecutive months; and (3) must keep units in good repair.

The bill also prohibits a large-scale landlord or a landlord the Department of Housing and Development (HUD) has found to have committed certain acts, such as repeated evictions without cause, from purchasing a federally supported mortgage or mortgage-backed security or obtaining federally provided mortgage insurance.

The bill allows nonresident aliens to receive HUD housing assistance. The bill also prohibits discrimination based on an individual's source of income in the sale or rental of housing and other related real estate transactions. Additionally, HUD may award grants for states and local governments to establish a right to counsel for tenants in eviction proceedings. The bill also authorizes additional grants and activities to evaluate and reduce lead and other hazards in housing.

The bill also (1) increases the federal share of costs for state highway projects in jurisdictions with laws or regulations that encourage equitable growth, and (2) decreases the federal share for projects in jurisdictions with laws or regulations that discourage equitable growth.</summary>
