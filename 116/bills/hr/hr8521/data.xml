This bill prohibits the Department of the Interior from entering into a conservation easement with a term of more than 50 years.

The bill sets forth requirements for the renegotiation of a conservation easement at the request of an owner of land that is subject to a conservation easement that (1) has been in effect for longer than 50 years, or (2) was put into effect before 1977 without the creation of an official corresponding map. Interior shall notify such an owner of the owner's right to submit a request.</summary>
