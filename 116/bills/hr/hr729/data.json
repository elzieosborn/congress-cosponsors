    "text": "Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act\n\nThis bill addresses provisions related to coastal zone management, waterfronts, climate change, fish habitats, the Great Lakes, coastal science and data, and the National Sea Grant College Program.\n\nTITLE I--COASTAL RESILIENCE AND ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT\n\n(Sec. 101) This section authorizes the Department of Commerce to award grants to Indian tribes to further achievement of any of the following tribal coastal zone objectives:\n\n protecting, restoring, or preserving areas in the zone that hold important ecological, cultural, or sacred significance for the tribes, or traditional, historic, and esthetic values essential to the tribes; preparing and implementing a special area management plan and technical planning for important coastal areas; and implementing any coastal or shoreline stabilization measure for the purpose of public safety, public access, or cultural or historical preservation. (Sec. 102) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must award grants to state or local governments, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations to (1) implement climate-resilient living shoreline projects; and (2) encourage innovation in the use of natural materials to protect coastal communities, habitats, and natural system functions.\n\n(Sec. 103) This section addresses the preservation and accessibility of waterfronts in coastal states.\n\nNOAA must establish a Working Waterfront Task Force that will be designed to identify and address critical working waterfront needs with respect to cultural and economic importance, environmental threats, and market conditions for water-dependent businesses.\n\nNOAA must also establish a Working Waterfront Grant Program. Under the program, NOAA may award grants to coastal states with approved working waterfront plans in place to preserve and expand access to coastal waters for people engaged in fishing, aquaculture, boat building, and other water-dependent businesses.\n\nIn addition, NOAA is authorized to award grants to coastal states for the purpose of developing or revising working waterfront plans.\n\nStates are allowed to allocate any grant money received to eligible local governments and other entities. Each state that is awarded a grant must contribute at least 25% of matching funds towards the total cost of the project carried out with the grant, subject to certain exceptions.\n\n(Sec. 104) This section establishes the Working Waterfronts Preservation Loan Fund to provide loans to coastal states for the purpose of implementing working waterfront plans.\n\n(Sec. 105) This section makes the District of Columbia eligible to receive federal coastal zone management funding, including flood mitigation and prevention funds.\n\n(Sec. 106) Commerce must establish a coastal climate change adaptation preparedness and response program to (1) assist coastal states with voluntarily developing coastal climate change adaptation plans, and (2) provide financial and technical assistance and training for coastal states to implement the adaptation plans.\n\n(Sec. 107) NOAA must update at least once every seven years its environmental sensitivity index products for each coastal area of the Great Lakes. An environmental sensitivity index product is a map or similar tool that is utilized to identify sensitive shoreline resources prior to an oil spill event.\n\n(Sec. 108) Commerce may carry out a program to award competitive prizes to advance certain coastal risk reduction and resilience measures, including natural features such as dunes, reefs, and wetlands.\n\n(Sec. 109) NOAA must identify and evaluate federal research activities regarding coastal risk reduction and resilience measures.\n\nTITLE II--FISHERY RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION\n\nSubtitle A--National Fish Habitat Conservation Through Partnerships\n\nThis subtitle establishes the National Fish Habitat Board to (1) encourage partnerships among public agencies and other interested parties to promote fish conservation, (2) establish national goals and priorities for fish habitat conservation, (3) recommend to Congress entities for designation as a Fish Habitat Partnership, and (4) review and make recommendations regarding fish habitat conservation projects.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) may provide technical and scientific assistance to the partnerships, participants in the fish habitat conservation projects, and the board.\n\nSubtitle B--Great Lakes Fishery Research Authorization\n\n The USGS may conduct monitoring, scientific assessments, and research in support of fisheries within the Great Lakes Basin between the United States and Canada.\n\nThe USGS shall (1) execute a comprehensive, multi-lake, freshwater fisheries science program; (2) work cooperatively with regional, state, tribal, and local governments; and (3) consult with interested groups, including academia and Canadian agencies.\n\nThe USGS may provide\n\n deepwater ecosystem research, fish behavior and habitat reports, fish population assessments, invasive species research, use of biological equipment and laboratory capabilities necessary to support fishery management decisions, and studies that assess impacts on Great Lakes fishery resources. Subtitle C--Chesapeake Bay Oyster Research\n\nNOAA must award grants to certain entities for collaborative research projects on the conservation, restoration, or management of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nTITLE III--MEETING 21ST CENTURY OCEAN AND COASTAL DATA NEEDS\n\nSubtitle A--Digital Coast\n\nThis subtitle provides statutory authority for and revises NOAA's Digital Coast program. (The program currently exists under NOAA to provide data, tools, and training that communities use to manage their coastal resources.)\n\nNOAA must focus on filling data needs and gaps for critical coastal management issues and support continued improvement in existing efforts to coordinate the acquisition and integration of key data sets needed for coastal management.\n\nNOAA may enter into financial agreements and collect fees to carry out the program.\n\nSubtitle B--Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System\n\nThis subtitle reauthorizes through FY2024 and revises the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act of 2009.\n\nTITLE IV--NATIONAL SEA GRANT COLLEGE PROGRAM AMENDMENTS\n\nThis title reauthorizes through FY2025 and revises the National Sea Grant College Program, through which NOAA supports university-based programs that focus on studying, conserving, and effectively using U.S. coastal resources.\n\nAmong other things, the title requires NOAA to award Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowships. Currently, NOAA has discretion in awarding such fellowships. The fellowships support the placement of graduate students in fields related to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources in positions with the executive and legislative branches.\n\nThe title reauthorizes through FY2025 grants for (1) university research on the biology, prevention, and control of aquatic nonnative species; (2) university research on oyster diseases, oyster restoration, and oyster-related human health risks; (3) university research on the biology, prevention, and forecasting of harmful algal blooms; and (4) fishery extension activities conducted by sea grant colleges or sea grant institutes to enhance existing core program funding.\n\nThe title authorizes grants for (1) priority issues identified in the National Sea Grant Program's strategic plan, and (2) university research on sustainable aquaculture techniques and technologies."
