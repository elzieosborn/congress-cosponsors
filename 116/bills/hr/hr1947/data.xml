  <summary date="2022-02-22T18:38:42Z" status="Passed House">This bill exempts from fiscal year limitations funds transferred after FY2016 from federal agencies to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for research or education by nonprofit corporations at VA medical centers.

The bill also authorizes the use of GI Bill funds to pay for flight training if it is required for the course of education being pursued. The bill applies a tuition cap in situations where a public institution has contracted with another entity to provide certain training.

Additionally, the bill provides that participants using educational assistance for flight training may elect to receive accelerated tuition and fee payments if they receive educational counseling. These amounts shall not exceed the total cost of tuition and fees for the flight training, and shall not affect housing stipend payments.

Finally, the bill authorizes the VA to provide inscriptions for deceased spouses and children on certain headstones furnished by the VA.</summary>
