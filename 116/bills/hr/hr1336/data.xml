This bill requires the federal government to ensure that children who are separated from their parents at the border by the Department of Homeland Security receive mental health services for free, including a mental health assessment within 24 hours of such separation and annually thereafter, as needed. Children who have already been separated (since April 6, 2018) must receive a mental health assessment within 24 hours after enactment of this bill.</summary>
