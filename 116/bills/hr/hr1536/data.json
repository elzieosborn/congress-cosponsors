    "text": "Protecting Our Children's Future Act of 2019\n\nThis bill makes several changes to the federal budget process. The changes to the budget process include\n\n converting the existing annual budget and appropriations process to a biennial process; changing the calendar period for the federal fiscal year (currently October 1 through September 30) to January 1 through December 31; requiring mandatory spending programs to be subject to the appropriations process with exceptions for Social Security, Medicare, programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and TRICARE; requiring the baseline budget of each department or agency to be assumed to be zero and each proposed expenditure to be justified as if it were a new expenditure; requiring Congress to consider appropriations bills using procedures similar to the existing budget reconciliation process, which includes expedited procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate; and withholding pay for Members of Congress if the House and Senate have not jointly agreed to a congressional budget resolution by June 30 of the first year of a Congress."
