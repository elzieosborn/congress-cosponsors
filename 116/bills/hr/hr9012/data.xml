This bill repeals a provision that requires federal agencies to procure products from Federal Prison Industries (FPI). The bill also makes FPI ineligible to produce any product under certain federal contracts awarded to small businesses, and prohibits federal agencies from entering into a contract with FPI under which an inmate worker would have access to certain classified data or personal information.</summary>
