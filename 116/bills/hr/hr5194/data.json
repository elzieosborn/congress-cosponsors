Specifically, these entities will be evaluated every two years on whether they have the capital necessary to absorb financial losses that would arise under several different climate change risk scenarios.\n\nThe bill also establishes the Climate Risk Scenario Technical Development Group to provide recommendations to the board regarding such climate change risk scenarios, and determine the financial and economic risks of these scenarios.\n\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council of the Department of the Treasury must establish a subcommittee to assist it in identifying risks and responding to threats to the financial system as a result of climate change."
