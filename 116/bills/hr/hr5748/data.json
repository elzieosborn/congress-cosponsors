Labor must help coordinate such recruitment.\n\nThe jobs, training, and apprenticeships must be conducted in conjunction with Labor, labor unions and associations involved in infrastructure rebuilding, and the National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee.\n\nLabor unions, contractors, and businesses involved with such infrastructure or systems must recruit by seeking assistance from the African American community, churches, and civil rights organizations."
