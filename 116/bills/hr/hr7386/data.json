Specifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is prohibited from insuring such a loan, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prohibited from purchasing such a loan, unless a borrower provides specified tenant protections, including\n\n one-year renewable lease terms, unless there is good cause for nonrenewal; a 60-day advance notice of any increase in rent, or of a sale or closure of the community; a five-day grace period for rent payments; and a right for a tenant to sell a manufactured home within a reasonable time period after eviction. The bill also establishes the Manufactured Home Company Lending Standards Commission to propose additional consumer protection standards."
