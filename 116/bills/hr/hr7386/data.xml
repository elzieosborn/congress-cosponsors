  <summary date="2021-03-23T14:33:34Z" status="Introduced in House">Helping Owners Meet Essential Standards Act of 2020 or the HOMES Act of 2020 

This bill requires manufactured housing communities and home parks to meet minimum consumer protections to be eligible for certain federally-backed loans for the construction, substantial rehabilitation, or purchase of these communities. Specifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is prohibited from insuring such a loan, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prohibited from purchasing such a loan, unless a borrower provides specified tenant protections, including

 one-year renewable lease terms, unless there is good cause for nonrenewal; a 60-day advance notice of any increase in rent, or of a sale or closure of the community; a five-day grace period for rent payments; and a right for a tenant to sell a manufactured home within a reasonable time period after eviction. The bill also establishes the Manufactured Home Company Lending Standards Commission to propose additional consumer protection standards.</summary>
