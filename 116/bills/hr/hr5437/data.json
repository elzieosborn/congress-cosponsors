    "text": "Boosting America's Exports Act\n\nThis bill establishes measures to promote exports by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\n Specifically, the bill requires the International Trade Administration (ITA) to assess the location of and services provided by U.S. Export Assistance Centers in relation to the location of SMEs that export U.S. products and services. The ITA shall then issue a report identifying (1) centers that serve a comparatively high number of SMEs, and (2) locations where a center should be established. Further, the ITA shall implement the changes recommended in such report and may establish up to 30 new centers based on the report.\n\nIn addition, the ITA shall take necessary steps, through actions by the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, to increase exports by SMEs."
