This bill requires the General Services Administration to establish a common fee schedule for the processing of certain wireless facilities deployment applications, including (1) the grant of an easement, right-of-way, or lease to, in, over, or on property owned by the federal government; and (2) communications facility installation sitings.

Such fees shall be competitively neutral and based on direct and actual cost recovery. Further, any fee collected may be used to cover the costs of granting such easement, right-of-way, or lease if the funds are provided in an appropriations bill.</summary>
