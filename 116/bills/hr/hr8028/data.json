    "text": "Protect Minority Student Borrowers Act\n\nThis bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of a credit applicant's institution of higher education (IHE).\n\nSpecifically, the bill makes it unlawful for a private education lender to discriminate against a credit applicant based on the IHE that the applicant plans to attend, currently attends, or previously attended. The Department of Justice may bring a civil action against a private education lender for violations.\n\nThe bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to study and report on the extent to which private education lenders discriminate against applicants who attend minority-serving IHEs."
