This bill prohibits businesses or the federal government from taking adverse actions (e.g., retaliating) against employees or contractors who engage in certain protected activities such as advocacy related to the conditions or practices in a foreign country (i.e., countries of concern such as China or countries that inhibit free speech or religious freedom) when the protected activity has the potential to result in economic retaliation by that country or because that country explicitly or implicitly requests that the domestic entity take such adverse action.</summary>
