This bill makes permanent the modifications to the child tax credit that were included in P.L. 115-97 (commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). (The provisions increased the amounts of the credit and created a nonrefundable credit for a taxpayer's dependents who are not qualifying children. Under current law, the provisions are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.)</summary>
