  <summary date="2020-02-29T20:29:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Richard G. Lugar and Ellen O. Tauscher Act to Maintain Limits on Russian Nuclear Forces

This bill imposes reporting requirements relating to&#160;the possible expiration of the Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START treaty) between the United States and Russia, which is set to expire in in February 2021 but may be extended to February 2026.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence shall report to Congress on the intelligence implications of the treaty's expiration without a new U.S.-Russia arms control agreement. The report shall contain specified elements including assessments of (1) the size and posture of Russia's nuclear forces with and without a treaty extension, (2) the impact of the treaty's expiration on U.S. allies, and (3) the impact of the treaty's expiration on U.S. intelligence capabilities.

The Department of State shall report to Congress on the likely reactions of U.S. allies, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries, to a U.S. decision to not extend the treaty or enter into a similar agreement with Russia. The State Department shall periodically report to Congress until the treaty's extension or expiration on discussions with Russia on extending the treaty or entering into a similar agreement.

If the treaty expires without a new arms control agreement, the President shall provide Congress a justification for allowing the treaty to expire and certify that extending the treaty was not in U.S. national security interests.</summary>
