This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to implement a partial student loan forgiveness reduction schedule and conduct awareness activities relating to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

Specifically, ED must

 implement a public service loan forgiveness reduction schedule to cancel principal and interest due on Federal Direct Loans based on the number of payments made by the borrower, develop informational materials relating to the eligibility requirements of the PSLF program, make such informational materials available on its website and conduct outreach to not-for-profit institutions and government organizations about the availability of such materials, and establish an online portal for borrowers to submit employment certification forms.</summary>
