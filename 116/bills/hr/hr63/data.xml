This bill&#160;requires loan disclosure forms for&#160;federal student loans&#160;to be written in plain language, thus enabling borrowers to understand loan terms, total costs of loans, and estimated monthly repayments. Borrowers must&#160;acknowledge in writing that they have read the form before the loans are issued.</summary>
