This bill makes permanent the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).

From the amounts deposited into the LWCF, $450 million shall be available in each fiscal year to carry out the purposes of the LWCF.

Of the total amount available through appropriations or deposited into the fund under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, at least 40% shall be for federal purposes, and at least 40% shall be for financial assistance to states.

The bill prohibits the use of any funds to states for acquisition of lands or waters by eminent domain.

At least 3% of appropriated or expended LWCF funds must be available for projects that secure public access to existing federal public land for hunting, fishing, and other recreational purposes.

The bill establishes a National Park Service and Related Agencies Maintenance and Revitalization Conservation Fund for the deposit through FY2029 of $450 million from mineral revenues that are not otherwise credited, covered, or deposited under federal law. Of amounts made available from this fund, the Department of the Interior shall use specified amounts for priority deferred maintenance needs that support critical infrastructure and visitor services.</summary>
