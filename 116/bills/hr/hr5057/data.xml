This bill specifically extends the duration of pass-through status (i.e., additional payment) for certain radiopharmaceuticals under the Medicare prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services. In particular, the bill provides that a radiopharmaceutical with an indication for certain PET imaging that is covered in relation to clinical studies (i.e., coverage with evidence development) continues to receive pass-through status until the applicable coverage review is complete, if such status initially expired on either December 31, 2017, or December 31, 2018.</summary>
