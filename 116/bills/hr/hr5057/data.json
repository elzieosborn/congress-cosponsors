In particular, the bill provides that a radiopharmaceutical with an indication for certain PET imaging that is covered in relation to clinical studies (i.e., coverage with evidence development) continues to receive pass-through status until the applicable coverage review is complete, if such status initially expired on either December 31, 2017, or December 31, 2018."
