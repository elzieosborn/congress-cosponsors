This bill designates (1) the Chisholm National Historic Trail, and (2) the Western National Historic Trail.

The Department of the Interior shall administer any portion of these trails that is located on nonfederal land only (1) with the voluntary consent of the owner of the nonfederal land, and (2) if the portion qualifies for certification as a component of the applicable trail. The approval by an owner of applicable nonfederal land of a certification agreement shall satisfy the voluntary consent requirement. A certification agreement may be terminated at any time.

The establishment of these trails does not authorize any person to enter private property without the consent of the private property's owner.

 Interior may accept a donation of land or an interest in land for these trails, with specified exceptions.

Land or an interest in land may not be acquired for these trails by eminent domain or condemnation.</summary>
