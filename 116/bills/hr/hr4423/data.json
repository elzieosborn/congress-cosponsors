In their preparation or residency programs, such partnerships must use evidence-based methods and adhere to an evaluation plan that includes measurable performance objectives.\n\nThe bill also establishes an advisory committee within the Department of Education to conduct a feasibility study that, among other things, compiles best practices for educating and training profession-ready teachers and school leaders."
