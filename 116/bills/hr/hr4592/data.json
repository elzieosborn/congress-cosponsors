In developing international insurance standards, the parties must coordinate with state insurance regulators.\n\nParties representing the United States in such proceedings must consult with and notify Congress regarding the intention to participate in the negotiations, the nature and objectives of the negotiations, and the details of the agreement. Before entering into any agreement, the parties must report to Congress regarding the implementation and impact of the agreement."
