Information acquired in violation of such prohibitions may not be used to initiate deportation proceedings.\n\nDHS shall establish a training program for certain officers and employees on compliance with federal laws limiting certain political activities of federal employees and officers (e.g., the Hatch Act).\n\nThe bill establishes three positions to monitor and ensure compliance with the bill. These positions shall be within the DHS Office of Inspector General, the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and the Office of Special Counsel."
