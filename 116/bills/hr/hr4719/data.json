Currently, the federal share must not exceed 50%. This change is retroactive to December 5, 2018.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard shall properly mark all pierheads belonging to the United States that are located in certain lakes. Additionally, the bill prohibits (1) the Coast Guard from being involved with the installation of lighthouses, and (2) construction of lighthouses, beacons, public piers, or landmarks on any site until a cession of jurisdiction over the same has been made to the United States.\n\nThe bill eliminates outdated provisions related to the U.S. Lighthouse Service, which was merged into the Coast Guard."
