  <summary date="2020-05-02T18:23:03Z" status="Passed House">Funding Instruction for Safety, Health, and Security Avoids Fishing Emergencies Act or the FISH SAFE Act

This bill reauthorizes through FY2021 and expands the Department of Health and Human Services fishing safety training and research grant programs.

The bill increases the maximum federal share of the costs of any activity that may be carried out using grants under the programs to 75%. Currently, the federal share must not exceed 50%. This change is retroactive to December 5, 2018.

The U.S. Coast Guard shall properly mark all pierheads belonging to the United States that are located in certain lakes. Additionally, the bill prohibits (1) the Coast Guard from being involved with the installation of lighthouses, and (2) construction of lighthouses, beacons, public piers, or landmarks on any site until a cession of jurisdiction over the same has been made to the United States.

The bill eliminates outdated provisions related to the U.S. Lighthouse Service, which was merged into the Coast Guard.</summary>
