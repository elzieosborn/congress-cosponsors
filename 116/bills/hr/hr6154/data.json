The bill also establishes the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as the primary regulators of cryptocurrencies. Finally, the bill establishes the Securities and Exchange Commission as the primary regulator of cryptosecurities and synthetic stablecoins."
