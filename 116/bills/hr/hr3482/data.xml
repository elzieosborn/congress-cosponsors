  <summary date="2022-06-09T14:11:25Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes that a U.S. national who otherwise qualifies may become a citizen upon establishing residence and physical presence in a U.S. outlying possession (i.e. American Samoa and Swains Island). Currently, U.S. nationals must become a resident of a state to qualify for naturalization.Individuals born in an outlying possession are U.S. nationals but do not automatically acquire citizenship through birth in an outlying possession.

The bill also waives certain naturalization requirements, including those related to English language proficiency and participation in a public ceremony, for individuals who have continuously resided in an outlying possession or state from birth to the approval of a naturalization application.</summary>
