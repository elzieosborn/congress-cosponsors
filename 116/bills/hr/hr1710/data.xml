This bill directs the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to report on the status of the U.S. automotive industry.

The bill delays the submission to the President of the Department of Commerce's investigation initiated on May 23, 2018, regarding the effects on national security of importing automobiles and automotive parts. The submission is delayed until the USITC submits its report to the President and Congress and the President subsequently determines not to reopen the investigation.</summary>
