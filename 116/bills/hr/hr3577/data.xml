  <summary date="2021-01-27T18:52:57Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to establish a program under which it may enter an agreement with an agency of a state, local, or tribal government to provide property, products, or services on behalf of the agency.

The bill permits the USPS to do so if the program (1) provides enhanced value to the public, such as by lowering the cost or raising the quality of the property, products, or services or by making them more accessible; (2) does not interfere with or detract from the value of postal services; and (3) will provide a reasonable contribution to the USPS's institutional costs.</summary>
