  <summary date="2020-04-01T18:15:17Z" status="Introduced in House">Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program Authorization Act of 2019

This bill provides statutory authority for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP). That program was established to address and reduce national security, border security, and terrorist threats before such threats reach the international border of the United States.

Before carrying out BITMAP operations in a foreign country, DHS must enter into an agreement with the government of such country that sets forth program goals for such country and must provide the congressional homeland security committees with a copy of the agreement.</summary>
