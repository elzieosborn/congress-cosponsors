At least 50% of grant funds must be used to retain employees who\u00a0would otherwise be laid off due to budget cuts.\n\nLabor must encourage grantees to use grant funds to retain, employ, or train veterans, individuals with disabilities, individuals receiving unemployment benefits, or dislocated workers."
