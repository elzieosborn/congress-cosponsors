The report shall assess whether WHO regulations need to be updated and whether new mechanisms are needed to effectively address pandemics and increase accountability.\n\nMaterials submitted in support of the President's annual budget shall include an assessment of (1) whether institutional reforms at the WHO are needed to ensure accountability and effectiveness, and (2) whether U.S. contributions to the WHO should be withheld in the absence of such reforms."
