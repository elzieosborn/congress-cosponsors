  <summary date="2020-12-30T19:29:17Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill modifies statutory requirements related to certain procedures limiting the retention of communications incidentally acquired during an intelligence activity.

Specifically, the bill removes a requirement that such procedures must permit the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of such communications. (An existing executive order authorizes intelligence community agencies to collect, retain, and disseminate incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in activities that may violate federal, state, local or foreign laws.)</summary>
