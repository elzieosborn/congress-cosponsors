  <summary date="2020-04-03T18:42:05Z" status="Introduced in House">Transnational Repression Accountability and Prevention Act of 2019 or the TRAP Act of 2019

This bill establishes requirements related to U.S. cooperation with International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) communications.

No U.S. agency or department may arrest an individual based solely on an INTERPOL notice without (1) prior validation of the individual's eligibility for extradition, (2) a diplomatic request for arrest from the requesting country, and (3) an arrest warrant.

A U.S. agency or department may not&#160;use an INTERPOL communication from an INTERPOL member country that does not have a bilateral extradition treaty with the United States as the sole basis for certain actions, such as detaining an individual or denying an individual a visa, without verifying that the communication likely comports with INTERPOL's constitution.

The bill requires reports on countries that abuse INTERPOL communications for political motives and other unlawful purposes.</summary>
