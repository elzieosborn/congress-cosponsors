 Interior may enter into such a lease only after the Department of Commerce has certified that the production facility to be located on the leased land will replace a production facility of the same size and type located in China.

Each lease shall be made for a 99-year term.

The rental fee for leases issued under this bill shall be set for $1 per acre per year.</summary>
