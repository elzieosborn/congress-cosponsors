This bill&#160;expands&#160;the federal work-study programs at&#160;institutions of higher education (IHEs) to include work-study programs that compensate students serving in a residency program at the IHE. A residency program refers to a school-based educator preparation program in which a prospective teacher, principal, or school leader (1) works for one academic year with a mentor teacher, principal, or other school leader; (2) receives concurrent instruction from the IHE; (3) acquires effective teaching or school leader skills; and (4) attains certification or licensure prior to completion of the program.</summary>
