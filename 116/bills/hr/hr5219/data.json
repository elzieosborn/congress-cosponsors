Currently, the copyright owner's performance right generally only covers digital audio transmission, which excludes certain terrestrial radio stations.\n\nA radio station must obtain express permission from the copyright owner of the sound recording before making such a transmission, unless the transmission consists of a religious assembly or incidental use of the recording.\n\nA radio station with revenues of less than $1 million per year shall be deemed to have obtained permission by paying $500 per year to the copyright owner. A public broadcast entity or individual terrestrial broadcast station shall pay no more than $100 per year to obtain permission from the copyright owner."
