  <summary date="2021-01-07T15:49:49Z" status="Introduced in House">An Act Targeting Resources to Communities in Need

This bill targets funding for designated development programs to counties and census tracts with persistently high poverty rates. Specifically, agencies that administer these programs must direct at least 10% of funding to counties with poverty rates that have equaled or exceeded 20% for at least 30 years. In addition, agencies must allocate, based on a formula, a certain level of funding to census tracts that have sustained poverty rates of 20% or higher for the past five years.

This funding model, known as the 10-20-30 proposal, has been applied through appropriations measures to, among other programs, rural development programs administered by the Department of Agriculture.</summary>
