Currently, open meetings requirements (such as those regarding public access, voting records, and notice) as they apply to the board are suspended during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency period if the board determines that unusual and exigent circumstances exist. The bill reinstates these open meetings requirements, with the exception of the advance notice requirement. The board must publish within 24 hours any determination that the board may hold meetings without such advance notice."
