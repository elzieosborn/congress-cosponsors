This bill prohibits federal law enforcement agencies, states and local governments, and high-risk urban areas from using facial recognition technology or other biometric surveillance systems on any image that is acquired by body-worn cameras used by law enforcement officers. The bill also includes enforcement provisions that require certain federal grants to be reduced for states, local governments, and high-risk urban areas that violate this restriction.</summary>
