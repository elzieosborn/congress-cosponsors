  <summary date="2021-02-18T18:18:16Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill establishes several grant programs and requirements for registries that collect data from lung cancer screenings with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) under Medicare. (Currently, for purposes of Medicare coverage, radiology imaging facilities that furnish such LDCT screenings must report certain data to approved registries.)

Specifically, the bill provides funds for FY2021-FY2025 for grants to help entities establish free registries, and requires registries to be interoperable in order to receive federal funds. The bill also provides grants to support the development of related quality measures for lung cancer screenings.</summary>
