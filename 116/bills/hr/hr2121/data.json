The bill defines such trafficking to include the use of coercion, abduction, or fraud to recruit, transport, or harbor a person for the purpose of removing that person's organs.\n\nThe State Department shall annually report to Congress on human trafficking conducted for organ tracking purposes, including descriptions of the sources and methods associated with such trafficking, State Department activities to address such trafficking, and activities by other countries to address such trafficking."
