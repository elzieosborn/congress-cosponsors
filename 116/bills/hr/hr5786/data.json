Among other elements, the information published on the website should include statistics related to patient wait times, effectiveness of care, and staffing and vacancy information.\n\nThe website must be (1) directly accessible from the main VA website and the main websites of each VA medical center, and (2) understandable and usable by the general public.\n\nThe VA must implement a self-auditing process to assess the accuracy and completeness of the data available on the website and must enter an agreement for the Inspector General of the VA (or other entity) to validate the audits. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office shall review the website to assess the VA's compliance and to provide recommendations on how to improve the website."
