It requires that an agreement under such program must specify that DOD employees may not improperly use information that relates to a DOD acquisition or procurement for the benefit or advantage of the private-sector organization.\n\nDOD must ensure that the authority for operating a public-private talent exchange program is used to exchange personnel working on artificial intelligence applications. DOD must brief the congressional armed services committees on efforts to expand existing DOD public-private exchange programs and to ensure that such programs seek opportunities for exchanges with private sector entities working on artificial intelligence applications."
