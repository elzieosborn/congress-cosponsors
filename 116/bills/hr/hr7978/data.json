Such a determination and such actions are not subject to administrative review.\n\nInterior shall provide grants, loans, and loan guarantees to support biomass conversion facilities.\n\nThe bill allows the export of unprocessed timber of dead and dying trees from federal land in California.\n\nInterior shall establish a grant program to assist in the development and utilization of innovative activities relating to workforce development in the forest sector, raise public awareness about the forest sector, and connect individuals to careers in the forest sector.\n\nThe Department of Energy shall provide support to improve the energy resilience, power needs, and energy efficiency of critical facilities."
