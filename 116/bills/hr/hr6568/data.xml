  <summary date="2021-09-02T14:56:22Z" status="Introduced in House">Coverage for COVID-19 Treatment Act of 2020

This bill requires private health insurance plans to cover, without any cost-sharing requirement, medically necessary services for individuals who have been diagnosed with, or are presumed to have, COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury must, not later than one week after this bill is enacted, jointly issue guidance specifying the applicable services. Further, HHS must reimburse insurance plans for the cost-sharing amount for such services that would otherwise have been required. The bill provides funding for this reimbursement.</summary>
