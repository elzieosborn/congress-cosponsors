Specifically, eligibility is expanded to include (1) members of the Coast Guard who participated in a drug interdiction operation; and (2) members of the National Guard or Reservists who were activated due to a national emergency or major disaster declared by the President, or responded to a disaster or civil disorder in a state. Vet Centers are community-based counseling centers that provide social and psychological services to eligible veterans, active duty service members, and their families.\n\nThe bill also requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit a plan to provide Vet Center services to veterans living in geographic areas where no Vet Center is located."
