All-payer claims databases collect and publish health care claims data from various payers for such services, including private insurance plans, government employee plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. HHS must prioritize awarding grants to states that, among other things, require mandatory reporting of claims data. Further, the bill permits states to require self-insured employer plans to submit claims data to the state's all-payer claims database."
