  <summary date="2020-10-13T14:04:45Z" status="Introduced in House">Verify Eligibility Coverage Act

 This bill allows a state to delay or deny an individual's initial eligibility for Medicaid benefits without providing a reasonable opportunity to submit evidence of a satisfactory immigration status or pending official verification of such status. A state that elects to provide a reasonable period for an individual to provide such evidence may not receive payment for amounts expended on the individual's medical assistance during that period.

In FY2020-FY2028, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services,&#160;using&#160;the Medicaid Improvement Fund, shall pay a 90%&#160;Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (i.e., federal matching rate) to eligible states for home- and community-based services furnished under a state Medicaid waiver to patients&#160;who had been on&#160;a waiting list for such services.</summary>
