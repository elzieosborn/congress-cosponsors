  <summary date="2020-12-03T19:27:01Z" status="Public Law">United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act

This bill provides statutory authority for the trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada (USMCA), which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement. Specifically, the bill implements provisions that include labor and environment monitoring and enforcement, de minimis levels for U.S. exports, and cooperation among treaty members to prevent duty evasion.

For example, the bill (1) establishes interagency committees for the monitoring and enforcement of relevant labor, environmental, and automobile-related provisions; (2) establishes penalties for false certification of goods under the rules of origin; and (3) authorizes certain agencies to detail employees to the U.S. embassy in Mexico to aid with monitoring and enforcement actions related to environmental provisions.

For more detailed information, see Congressional Research Service Report R44981, The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).</summary>
