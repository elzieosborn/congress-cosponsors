These suspensions last until six months after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency period.\n\nAdditionally, during the COVID-19 public health emergency period, and for 60 days thereafter, public housing agencies may not terminate available low-income housing choice vouchers for the failure to enter into a lease."
