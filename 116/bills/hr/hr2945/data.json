    "text": "This bill provides for the continuation of certain military land withdrawals and makes changes to the administration of natural resources on military installations.\n\nThe bill removes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the acting agency that provides for the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources on military installations, except in the case of a military installation or state-owned National Guard installation in Alaska.\n\nEach integrated natural resources management plan for a military installation or state-owned National Guard installation outside Alaska must be reviewed (1) jointly by the military department concerned and the Department of the Interior, and (2) in a manner that provides affected states and Indian tribes and the public an opportunity to comment on any significant revisions to the plan that may be proposed.\n\nThe bill eliminates the withdrawal termination date for lands including (1) the El Centro Naval Air Facility in California, (2) the Juniper Butte military range in Idaho, (3) the Barry M. Goldwater military range in Arizona, and (4) the Fort Irwin military land withdrawal in California.\n\nThe land withdrawals for the Fort Greely and Fort Wainwright military training ranges in Alaska shall be terminated on November 6, 2026."
