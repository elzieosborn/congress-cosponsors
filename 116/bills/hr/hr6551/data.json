Specifically, required compliance with this standard is delayed through the first day of an institution's fiscal year beginning after the end of the emergency declaration regarding the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak. Currently, this delay ends the earlier of the date on which the emergency declaration terminates, or December 31, 2020."
