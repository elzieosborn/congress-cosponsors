This bill generally revises the cost-benefit analysis requirements for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

It establishes in the CFTC the Office of the Chief Economist. The office must perform the cost-benefit analyses of proposed CFTC regulations and orders. Additionally, such cost-benefit analyses must consider, among other things, the impact of market liquidity on relevant markets, available alternatives to direct regulation, and the cost of compliance for all regulated entities.

A court must affirm such cost-benefit analyses, unless it finds an abuse of discretion.</summary>
