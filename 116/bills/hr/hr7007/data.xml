  <summary date="2020-06-29T14:28:49Z" status="Introduced in House">Compensation for Americans Act of 2020

This bill requires the Department of State to negotiate with China to secure compensation for China's distortion of information related to the spread of COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). The bill also contains other China-related provisions, such as those&#160;imposing sanctions on certain Chinese individuals and entities.

The President s may terminate such prohibitions and sanctions if China and the United States come to an agreement regarding compensation related to COVID-19.

The Department of the Treasury shall establish a public repository with information about entities that are owned, financed, or controlled by the Chinese government.

Other provisions in this bill include (1) imposing export controls on telecommunications equipment that would help China carry out censorship or surveillance, (2) banning researchers affiliated with China's military from obtaining visas, and (3) requiring U.S. World Bank representatives to end China's eligibility for World Bank assistance.</summary>
