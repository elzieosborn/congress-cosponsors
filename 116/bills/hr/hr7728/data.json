For individuals who become disabled or die as a result of COVID-19, it shall be presumed the individual became disabled or died during a qualified period of duty.\n\nAn individual who was disabled or died due to COVID-19 and was on training duty or full-time National Guard duty shall be furnished death or disability benefits as if the individual were a veteran, without regard to whether such individual's duty period would constitute active military service."
