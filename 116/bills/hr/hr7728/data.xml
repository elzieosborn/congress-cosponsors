  <summary date="2022-02-24T16:36:44Z" status="Introduced in House">COVID-19 Benefits for Active Duty Servicemembers, the Reserve Components, and their Survivors Act of 2020

This bill establishes, for purposes of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits, a presumption of service-connection if COVID-19 symptoms manifest within a specified time period in individuals serving in the military or reserves during qualified periods of duty (i.e., active duty, training duty, or full-time National Guard duty). For individuals who become disabled or die as a result of COVID-19, it shall be presumed the individual became disabled or died during a qualified period of duty.

An individual who was disabled or died due to COVID-19 and was on training duty or full-time National Guard duty shall be furnished death or disability benefits as if the individual were a veteran, without regard to whether such individual's duty period would constitute active military service.</summary>
