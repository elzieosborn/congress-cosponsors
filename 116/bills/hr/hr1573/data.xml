This bill requires each state to allow individuals with disabilities to use absentee registration procedures and to vote by absentee ballot in federal elections.

Among other things, each state must

 accept and process any otherwise valid voter registration and absentee ballot applications from individuals with disabilities if such applications are received within 30 days of the federal election; establish procedures for individuals with disabilities to request, and for the state to send, voter registration and absentee ballot applications by mail and through electronic means; create procedures for securely transmitting blank absentee ballots by mail and through electronic means to individuals with disabilities; designate a single office to provide information on voter registration and absentee ballot procedures for individuals with disabilities; and specify a means of electronic communication for individuals with disabilities to request, and for the state to send, voter registration and absentee ballot applications. Further, each state must transmit a validly requested absentee ballot to an individual with a disability within 45 days of an election. However, the bill establishes a procedure for a state to apply to the Department of Justice for a waiver of this requirement.

 The bill also permanently reauthorizes and expands a program under which the Department of Health and Human Services makes payments to eligible states and units of local government to assure voting access for individuals with disabilities.</summary>
