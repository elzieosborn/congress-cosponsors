This bill makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to adjourn for more than 12 hours during any lapse in appropriations for all or part of the federal government.

Furthermore, in the Senate, the bill permits waiver or suspension of such prohibition, or a successful appeal of a ruling of the chair regarding such prohibition, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Senate.</summary>
