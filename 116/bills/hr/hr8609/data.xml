This bill prohibits the Department of Justice from designating Drug Enforcement Administration officers to perform law enforcement duties that do not relate to drug investigations. It also generally prohibits the U.S. Marshals Service from deputizing other law enforcement officers and the Department of Homeland Security from designating additional employees to protect federal property during a protest unless there is a request by a state, Indian tribe, territory, or the District of Columbia.</summary>
