  <summary date="2020-03-03T14:57:37Z" status="Introduced in House">Rural Broadband Permitting Efficiency Act of 2019

This bill authorizes federal departments to delegate federal environmental compliance for broadband projects to states and Indian tribes.

Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of the Interior to establish a voluntary program whereby states or Indian tribes may opt-in to an agreement allowing them to take on the responsibility of environmental review for the permitting of broadband projects.

Such projects must be located within an operational right-of-way (all real property interests acquired for the construction or operation of a project) on (1) national forest system land, (2) land managed by Interior, or (3) Indian lands.

 USDA and Interior shall also establish broadband permit streamlining teams to coordinate and expedite permitting decisions for broadband projects.</summary>
