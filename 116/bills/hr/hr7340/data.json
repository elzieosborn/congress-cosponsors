Among other information, the plan must detail (1) the personal protective equipment (PPE) that the agency will provide to its employees; (2) protections for employees whose work requires them to be in nonfederal buildings, such as auditors; and (3) potential measures to reverse the reopening that still ensure the continuity of operations.\n\nEach agency's Office of the Inspector General must report on whether the agency has complied with this bill's requirements and whether the agency has provided adequate PPE for its employees."
