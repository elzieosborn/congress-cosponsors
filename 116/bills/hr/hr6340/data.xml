  <summary date="2021-03-15T17:43:29Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides for mortgage forbearance for single family and multifamily mortgages during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) emergency. Borrowers receiving a forbearance must provide rent relief for any tenants during this period. The bill also generally prohibits repossessions of vehicles and manufactured homes and foreclosures during the emergency.

The Federal Reserve Board and the Department of the Treasury must establish a credit program for mortgage servicers affected by the COVID-19 emergency.</summary>
