  <summary date="2020-10-08T20:16:10Z" status="Passed House">Consumer Product Safety Inspection Enhancement Act This bill modifies the screening procedures for consumer products moving through ports of entry. First, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) must consult with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target consumer products in violation of product safety rules, including (1) shipments that are valued below the threshold for the application of duties, (2) shipments from China, and (3) products that may both violate product safety rules and infringe intellectual property rights. The CPSC also must develop information technology systems that support connections to other specified customs control systems. Further, beginning not later than two years after the date of enactment, the bill requires manufacturers to electronically file certificates of compliance with applicable product safety rules for products intended for entry into the United States. Finally, the CPSC must hire, train, and assign specified full-time personnel to support the identification and assessment of products in violation of product safety rules at ports of entry.</summary>
