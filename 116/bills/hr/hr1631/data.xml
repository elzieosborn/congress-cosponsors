This bill requires that any absentee ballot for an election be carried through the mail expeditiously and free of charge.

The bill directs a state to use a requirements payment under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to reimburse the U.S. Postal Service for revenue it would have obtained from the mailing of absentee ballots but for the requirement that such ballots be mailed for free.</summary>
