This bill phases out the use of private prisons and private, for-profit community confinement facilities (e.g., halfway houses) to confine individuals serving terms for federal offenses. It also requires the Bureau of Prisons to provide inmates with counseling about resources in their communities as part of prerelease procedures and certain postrelease information about any fines, assessments, or other penalties connected to their convictions.</summary>
