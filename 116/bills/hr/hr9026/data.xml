This bill authorizes a court to disclose to a person information related to evidence collected about the person using certain foreign intelligence surveillance powers if the disclosure would likely promote a more accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance. (Currently, a court may disclose such information to the person only if the disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.)</summary>
