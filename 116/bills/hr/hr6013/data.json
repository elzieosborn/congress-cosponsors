    "text": "Veteran Families Financial Support Act\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to implement a new veterans life insurance program starting January 1, 2023, for veterans with a service-connected disability. The policy does not go into force unless a veteran has been paying premiums for two years after enrollment. If a veteran dies during the two-year period, the VA shall pay the veteran's beneficiary the amount of premiums paid by the veteran plus interest.\n\nThe bill phases out an existing service-disabled veteran insurance program upon the implementation of the program in this bill."
