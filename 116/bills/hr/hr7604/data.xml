This bill requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to ensure that the construction and acquisition of federal public buildings (e.g., agency office buildings) adheres to the principles of the report titled Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture.

The report was issued by the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space on June 1, 1962, and serves as the policy directive for the GSA's Design Excellence Program within its Public Buildings Service. Among other principles, the report prescribes against the development of an official architectural style for government buildings and encourages the government to avoid excessive uniformity in building design.</summary>
