    "text": "Bolster American Technology Through Expanding Recycling Yield Act of 2020 or the BATTERY Act of 2020\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a research, development, and demonstration program of recycling of energy critical materials embedded within energy storage systems (e.g., batteries). Energy critical materials means chemicals that have a high risk of a supply disruption and are critical to one or more energy-related technologies; a substantial supply disruption of such material would significantly inhibit large-scale deployment of technologies that produce, transmit, store, or conserve energy.\n\nDOE must seek to ensure that any activity receiving funding under the program (1) does not release toxic byproducts into the environment, (2) sufficiently minimizes potential fire risk in facilities where energy storage systems are stored and in the transportation of such systems, and (3) protects the health and safety of all persons involved in or in proximity to such activity."
