    "text": "This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to continue to review applications for certain biological products under an earlier review process, notwithstanding recent FDA guidance. Specifically, the bill applies to applications that were filed under the earlier process on or before March 23, 2019, and were still pending on March 23, 2020. (A 2009 law established a new procedure for approving biological products but allowed certain products in an already approved product class to receive approval under the earlier procedure until March 23, 2020; subsequently, in December 2018, the FDA issued guidance stating that an application filed under the earlier procedure that is not approved by March, 23, 2020, will not be approved.)"
